D&apos;Amato died a year before Tyson became the youngest heavyweight champion in history.\r\n\r\nIn Tyson&apos;s best-selling memoir Undisputed Truth, he recounted the role D&apos;Amato played in his formative years, adopting him at age 16 after his mother died and shaping him both physically and mentally after Tyson had spent years living in fear and poverty. In Iron Ambition, Tyson elaborates on the life lessons that D&apos;Amato passed down to him and reflects on how the trainer&apos;s words of wisdom continue to resonate with him outside the ring. The book also chronicles Cus&apos; courageous fight against the mobsters who controlled boxing, revealing more than we&apos;ve ever known about this singular cultural figure.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-09-26T12:00:57.914Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:b96a7d6c31bb74a5da024f9eb86e25ae61f841df","dn":"Iron Ambition by Mike Tyson 2017 RETAiL ePUB eBOOK-DiSTRiBUTiON","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"b96a7d6c31bb74a5da024f9eb86e25ae61f841df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,106,125,108,49,187,116,165,218,2,79,158,184,110,37,174,97,248,65,223]},"name":"Iron Ambition by Mike Tyson 2017 RETAiL ePUB eBOOK-DiSTRiBUTiON","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
