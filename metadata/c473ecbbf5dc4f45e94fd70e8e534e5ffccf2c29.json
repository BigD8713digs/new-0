The Great War was over, and American optimism was higher than the stock market. What better moment to launch an expedition to Antarctica, the planet&apos;s final frontier? This was the moon landing before the 1960s. Everyone wanted to join the adventure. Rockefellers and Vanderbilts begged to be taken along as mess boys, and newspapers across the globe covered the planning&apos;s every stage.\r\n\r\nThe night before the expedition&apos;s flagship launched, Billy Gawronski - a skinny, first-generation New York City high schooler desperate to escape a dreary future in the family upholstery business - jumped into the Hudson River and snuck aboard.\r\n\r\nCould he get away with it?\r\n\r\nFrom the grimy streets of New York&apos;s Lower East Side to the rowdy dance halls of sultry Francophone Tahiti, all the way to Antarctica&apos;s blinding white and deadly freeze, Laurie Gwen Shapiro&apos;s The Stowaway takes you on the unforgettable voyage of a gutsy young stowaway who became an international celebrity, a mascot for an up-by-your-bootstraps age.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-01-18T19:00:57.882Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:c473ecbbf5dc4f45e94fd70e8e534e5ffccf2c29","dn":"The Stowaway by Laurie Gwen Shapiro EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"c473ecbbf5dc4f45e94fd70e8e534e5ffccf2c29","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,115,236,187,245,220,79,69,233,79,215,14,142,83,78,95,252,207,44,41]},"name":"The Stowaway by Laurie Gwen Shapiro EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
