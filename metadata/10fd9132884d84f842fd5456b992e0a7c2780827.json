Atop the blueprint of some of his former work Moebius has built sick unease and atmospheric sophistication that conjure a bizarre dystopia. Not nightmarish in the traditional sense, Kram (translating as &apos;Stuff&apos;) is comfortable in its unrest, even encouraging us to evoke our own nightmares to accompany these slowly sprawling works.\r\nThe pace of the record is key to its success; from the opening track onwards, Kram must be viewed as a whole. When it begins with jarring Vangelis-derived synthesizer and aimless toying, &apos;Start&apos; is not so different to its own ending. The tonality hints at the major, but never lets it overrule the atmosphere of ponderous movement as clanks and industry voice their opinions on the material. That there is a five-minute period where rhythms are introduced and gently squeezed into being is irrelevant &#x2014; it&apos;s the widescreen view that must be adhered to...\r\nThough at times difficult to penetrate, quiet and reflective listening to Kram will reward massively. It&apos;s heartening that such a sonic technician still operates, and relieving to discover that his muse has progressed and matured, rather than aged. Kram is a record that will totally envelope, test and invigorate. - Daniel Ross, The Quietus","last_updated":"2017-08-19T12:04:02.968Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:10fd9132884d84f842fd5456b992e0a7c2780827","dn":"Dieter Moebius 2009 Kram","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"10fd9132884d84f842fd5456b992e0a7c2780827","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,253,145,50,136,77,132,248,66,253,84,86,185,146,224,167,194,120,8,39]},"name":"Dieter Moebius 2009 Kram","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
