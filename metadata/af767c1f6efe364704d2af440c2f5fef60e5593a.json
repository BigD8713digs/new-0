That&apos;s the reason why the 17-track compilation A-Sides is such a successful overview of the band&apos;s too-brief career. \r\nMost of their peers wouldn&apos;t be well represented by a compilation that concentrated solely on singles, but Soundgarden are, because their singles do capture what they&apos;re all about. There are many great songs left off A-Sides, from &quot;Big Dumb Sex&quot; to &quot;My Wave,&quot; but it&apos;s hard to argue with what&apos;s here. Each single from every album -- from the 1987 debut EP Screaming Life through SST&apos;s Ultramega OK, to their four records for A&amp;M -- is here, with the Down on the Upside outtake &quot;Bleed Together&quot; added as an enticement for collectors. \r\nAlmost every one of the group&apos;s best-known songs are here, including &quot;Hands All Over,&quot; &quot;Loud Love,&quot; &quot;Jesus Christ Pose,&quot; &quot;Outshined,&quot; &quot;Rusty Cage,&quot; &quot;Black Hole Sun,&quot; &quot;The Day I Tried to Live,&quot; &quot;Spoonman,&quot; &quot;Fell on Black Days,&quot; &quot;Pretty Noose,&quot; &quot;Burden in My Hand,&quot; and &quot;Blow Up the Outside World,&quot; resulting in a near-definitive summary of one of the most important and influential bands of the &apos;90s.
