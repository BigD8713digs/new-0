It was open from March 8, 1968, to June 27, 1971, and featured some of the biggest acts in rock music at the time. The Fillmore East was a companion to Graham&apos;s Fillmore Auditorium, and its successor, the Fillmore West, in San Francisco, Graham&apos;s home base.\r\nFillmore East became known as &quot;The Church of Rock and Roll,&quot; with two-show, triple-bill concerts several nights a week.\r\nBecause of changes in the music industry and large growth in the concert industry, Graham closed the Fillmore East.\r\n\r\nMountain is an American hard rock band that formed on Long Island, New York in 1969.
