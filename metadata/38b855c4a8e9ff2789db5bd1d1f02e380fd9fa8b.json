Enjoy this ReSeed.\r\n\r\nMark Griffin (born 1957), better known as MC 900 Ft. Jesus, is an American classically trained musician[1] turned rapper and experimental musician. The son of an army officer, Griffin moved around quite a bit before settling in Dallas, Texas in 1979. Griffin studied the trumpet and has a BA in Music from Morehead State University as well as an advanced degree in music from North Texas State University.[2] Before becoming MC 900 Ft. Jesus, Griffin played in local Dallas bands The Telefones and Lithium X-Mas.\r\nMC 900 Ft. Jesus&apos; music is influenced by hip hop, incorporating many sound samples. His first album, Hell With the Lid Off included the single &quot;Truth is Out of Style&quot; which gained a cult following. His subsequent single, &quot;The City Sleeps&quot;, explored the mind of a serial arsonist.\r\nHe released his last album, One Step Ahead of the Spider, in 1994; it contained the single &quot;If I Only Had a Brain&quot;, which became his best-known song. The song gained increased exposure from the music video directed for it by Spike Jonze, as well as exposure on MTV&apos;s Beavis and Butt-Head cartoon show.\r\n\r\nAll Three Albums from CD, Flac, 44khz\r\n\r\n\r\nHell with the Lid Off\r\n\r\n1 - &quot;A Greater God&quot; &#x2013; 2:52 (Chaney/Chaney)\r\n2 - &quot;Real Black Angel&quot; &#x2013; 4:21\r\n3 - &quot;Truth is Out of Style&quot; &#x2013; 5:43\r\n4 - &quot;UFO&apos;s Are Real&quot; &#x2013; 5:21\r\n5 - &quot;Shut Up&quot; &#x2013; 5:42\r\n6 - &quot;I&apos;m Going Straight to Heaven&quot; &#x2013; 4:03\r\n7 &quot;- Spaceman&quot; &#x2013; 6:55\r\n8 - &quot;Talking to the Spirits&quot; &#x2013; 6:31\r\n9 - &quot;Too Bad&quot; &#x2013; 5:33\r\n10 - &quot;A Place of Loneliness&quot; &#x2013; 0:47\r\n11 - &quot;Born with Monkey Asses&quot; &#x2013; 5:43\r\n12 - &quot;Straight to Heaven&quot; (instrumental) &#x2013; 4:04\r\n\r\n\r\nWelcome to My Dream\r\n\r\n1 - &quot;Falling Elevators&quot; &#x2013; 6:46\r\n2 - &quot;Killer Inside Me&quot; &#x2013; 4:08\r\n3 - &quot;Adventures in Failure&quot; &#x2013; 5:45\r\n4 - &quot;The City Sleeps&quot; &#x2013; 5:29\r\n5 - &quot;O-Zone&quot; &#x2013; 4:32\r\n6 - &quot;Hearing Voices in One&apos;s Head&quot; &#x2013; 5:54\r\n7 - &quot;Dali&apos;s Handgun&quot; &#x2013; 4:41\r\n8 - &quot;Dancing Barefoot&quot; &#x2013; 4:31\r\n\r\n\r\nOne Step Ahead of the Spider\r\n\r\n1 - &quot;New Moon&quot; &#x2013; 11:41\r\n2 - &quot;But If You Go&quot; &#x2013; 5:39\r\n3 - &quot;If I Only Had a Brain&quot; &#x2013; 3:46\r\n4 - &quot;Stare and Stare&quot; &#x2013; 6:58 (Mayfield)\r\n5 - &quot;Buried at Sea&quot; &#x2013; 4:46 (Griffin/Rollins)\r\n6 - &quot;Tiptoe Through the Inferno&quot; &#x2013; 4:50\r\n7 - &quot;Grac&#xED;as Pep&#xE9;&quot; &#x2013; 3:42 (Caldwell/Griffin)\r\n8 - &quot;New Year&apos;s Eve&quot; &#x2013; 3:43\r\n9 - &quot;Bill&apos;s Dream&quot; &#x2013; 8:15\r\n10 - &quot;Rhubarb&quot; &#x2013; 3:11","last_updated":"2018-07-14T12:12:49.643Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:38b855c4a8e9ff2789db5bd1d1f02e380fd9fa8b","dn":"MC 900 Ft.
