But instead of rules, this game has dark secrets, forbidden desires, inevitable betrayals&#x2014;and cold-blooded murder.\r\n\r\nOne is playing a long game. But which one?\r\n\r\nThey meet at a local tavern in the small town of Belleville, Delaware. Polly is set on heading west. Adam says he&apos;s also passing through. Yet she stays and he stays&#x2014;drawn to this mysterious redhead whose quiet stillness both unnerves and excites him. Over the course of a punishing summer, Polly and Adam abandon themselves to a steamy, inexorable affair. Still, each holds something back from the other&#x2014;dangerous, even lethal, secrets.\r\n\r\nThen someone dies. Was it an accident, or part of a plan? By now, Adam and Polly are so ensnared in each other&apos;s lives and lies that neither one knows how to get away&#x2014;or even if they want to. Is their love strong enough to withstand the truth, or will it ultimately destroy them?\r\n\r\nSomething&#x2014;or someone&#x2014;has to give.\r\n\r\nWhich one will it be?\r\n\r\nInspired by James M. Cain&apos;s masterpieces The Postman Always Rings Twice, Double Indemnity, and Mildred Pierce, Sunburn is a tantalizing modern noir from Laura Lippman","last_updated":"2018-04-25T12:12:52.903Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1883f00e3f00faa67ab64e6347c3fad094d8586","dn":"SUNBURN - Laura Lippman.
