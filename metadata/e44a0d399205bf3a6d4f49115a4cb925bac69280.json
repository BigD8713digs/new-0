Whether 4 brothers, 3 brothers and a Dad, or just a trio, their harmonies and swing style can not be beat. I was blessed to see them in concert in the mid 1970&apos;s (when they were probably pushing 70) and they still sounded great. This package contains some of the essential Mills Brothers hits. Check out Opus One if you&apos;ve never heard it. Backed by a large orchestra it really swings. Paper Doll is also a great work as well. The problem with this package (as with almost any &quot;greatest hits&quot; package) is you don&apos;t get to see enough of the versitality that they were known for. Also you don&apos;t get the early stuff, when they were known to provide their own instument sounds using nothing more than their voices. Overall a good addition to any collection, just don&apos;t stop looking for more. There is way too much great Mills Brothers songs still out there","last_updated":"2017-06-16T12:06:08.141Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:e44a0d399205bf3a6d4f49115a4cb925bac69280","dn":"The Mills Brothers Best of DECCA Years 320 (Big Papi) Jazz","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"e44a0d399205bf3a6d4f49115a4cb925bac69280","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,74,13,57,146,5,191,58,109,79,73,17,90,76,185,37,186,198,146,128]},"name":"The Mills Brothers Best of DECCA Years 320 (Big Papi) Jazz","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
