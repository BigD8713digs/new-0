It includes news, advice, feature articles, and celebrity columns and interviews.\r\nAmateur Gardening was founded in London in May 1884[2] by Shirley Hibberd, who edited it until 1887.[3] This makes it the oldest UK amateur gardening weekly still published today, and was Britain&apos;s best-seller in that category in 2013.[4] The magazine is published on a weekly basis.[2] Its editorial offices are in Poole, Dorset.[5]\r\n\r\nAt the time of the magazine&apos;s launch in 1884 there had been several other notable gardening magazines in circulation, including the Gardeners&apos; Chronicle and Gardens Illustrated, but these were tailored more for the professional gardener. Amateur Gardening is regarded as the first paper designed specifically for the amateur.\r\n\r\nThe founders were two brothers &#x2013; W.H. and L. Collingridge &#x2013; who also produced other periodicals of the time, including the well known City Press.\r\n\r\nThe first issue of Amateur Gardening consisted of just 16 pages, 12 of which were devoted to editorial matter. The first editor, Shirley Hibberd, was a botanist and an academic authority on gardening. He steered the magazine down a rocky road, with articles that were considered by many to be rather too technical. He stayed in the job for just two years.\r\n\r\nThe man who really established Amateur Gardening was T.W. Sanders, who was to remain editor for 40 years. Sanders knew exactly what the new generation of amateur gardeners wanted, and his style of editing attracted a wide audience. Prior to the First World War a circulation of 100,000 copies per week had been achieved, but this fell off considerably during the conflict. It was not until the mid-1920s that the magazine&apos;s circulation rose again to a healthy level.\r\n\r\nSanders also wrote a large number of books, the most important of which was Sanders&apos; Encyclopaedia of Gardening. It was the &#x2018;bible&apos; for several generations of gardeners, and is consulted even today","last_updated":"2017-07-20T12:01:44.651Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0c9ba14c3e63d5f1707f30aa1112ab4aef43f3e","dn":"Amateur Gardening - 22 July 2017 - True PDF - zeke23","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"c0c9ba14c3e63d5f1707f30aa1112ab4aef43f3e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,201,186,20,195,230,61,95,23,7,243,10,161,17,42,180,174,244,63,62]},"name":"Amateur Gardening - 22 July 2017 - True PDF - zeke23","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
