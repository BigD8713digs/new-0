Six months after the Declaration of Independence, America was nearly defeated. Then on Christmas night, George Washington led his men across the Delaware River to destroy the Hessians at Trenton. A week later Americans held off a counterattack, and in a brilliant tactical move, Washington crept behind the British army to win another victory. The momentum had reversed.\r\n\r\nThe &#x201C;Pivotal Moments in American History&#x201D; series seeks to unite the old and the new history, combining the insights and techniques of recent historiography with the power of traditional narrative. Each title has a strong narrative arc with drama, irony, suspense, and &#x2013; most importantly &#x2013; great characters who embody the human dimension of historical events. The general editors of &#x201C;Pivotal Moments&#x201D; are not just historians; they are popular writers themselves, and, in two cases, Pulitzer Prize winners: David Hackett Fischer, James M. McPherson, and David Greenberg. We hope you like your American History served up with verve, wit, and an eye for the telling detail!\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-05-06T12:02:32.566Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8deaf4f3e9968a73e2494161105daea1d9c852a","dn":"Washington's Crossing by David Hackett Fischer EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"b8deaf4f3e9968a73e2494161105daea1d9c852a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,222,175,79,62,153,104,167,62,36,148,22,17,5,218,234,29,156,133,42]},"name":"Washington's Crossing by David Hackett Fischer EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
