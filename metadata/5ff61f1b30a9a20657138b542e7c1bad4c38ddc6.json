Among the many faves: &#x201C;Swing Low Sweet Chariot,&#x201D; &#x201C;Deep Elem Blues,&#x201D; &#x201C;Oh, the Wind and Rain,&#x201D; &#x201C;Spike Driver Blues,&#x201D; &#x201C;Gone Home&#x201D; and &#x201C;Standin&#x2019; on the Corner (Blue Yodel #9).&#x201D;","last_updated":"2017-08-15T12:01:41.844Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ff61f1b30a9a20657138b542e7c1bad4c38ddc6","dn":"Jerry Garcia Acoustic Band - Almost Acoustic (Live Fall '87)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"5ff61f1b30a9a20657138b542e7c1bad4c38ddc6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,246,31,27,48,169,162,6,87,19,139,84,46,124,27,173,76,56,221,198]},"name":"Jerry Garcia Acoustic Band - Almost Acoustic (Live Fall '87)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
