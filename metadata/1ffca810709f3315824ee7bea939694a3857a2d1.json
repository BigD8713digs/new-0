Rudolph is joined by former Hawkwind bassist Alan Davey and original Mot&#xF6;rhead drummer Lucas Fox, who not only created a killer rhythm section for the album but added a bit of sizzling biker-rock to the mix! \r\nAnother Pink Fairies/Mot&#xF6;rhead member, Larry Wallis, was with the band in spirit as they churned out an excellent version of his tune &#x201C;Old Enuff To Know Better!&#x201D; &#x201C;I&#x2019;d say this journey started with Nik Turner introducing me to Cleopatra Records. I was asked about the possibility of recording a LP under the Pink Fairies banner and thought &#x2013; this would be a lot of fun. Get a few people together turn the amps up to 10 and let &#x2018;er rip. Larry Wallis wanted to be involved and Matt at Cleopatra suggested Alan Davey on bass and Lucas Fox on drums . It seemed like a good match considering the Hawkwind and Motorhead connections. Both Alan and I had been in Hawkwind and Larry and Lucas in the original Motorhead. We were all mates with Lemmy as well and the creative energy flowed as soon as we got to the studio in Austin. All of this helped by Jurgen Engler of Die Kruups behind the desk with Eric the engineer. \r\n\r\nTracklist: \r\n01. Resident Reptile.flac \r\n02. Old Enuff to Know Better.flac \r\n03.
