The diary reveals how in the early 1950&apos;s Israeli leaders deliberately provoked Arab states by military operations and covert terrorist actions, stirred up mass hysteria in Israel, and began plotting the takeover of southern Lebanon, Gaza and the West Bank. Rokach has selected from the diaries and other documents, and provided a fascinating commentary and analysis","last_updated":"2018-06-28T12:14:50.466Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac3db6ed6c4f473cdc9a50ea844f5ec0d9d90b19","dn":"Livia Rokach - Israel's Sacred Terrorism: A Study Based on Moshe","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"ac3db6ed6c4f473cdc9a50ea844f5ec0d9d90b19","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,61,182,237,108,79,71,60,220,154,80,234,132,79,94,192,217,217,11,25]},"name":"Livia Rokach - Israel's Sacred Terrorism: A Study Based on Moshe","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
