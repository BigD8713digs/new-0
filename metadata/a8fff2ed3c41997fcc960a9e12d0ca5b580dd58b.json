Beginning with neutron physics background and modeling of transport and diffusion, this self-contained learning tool progresses step-by-step to discussions of reactor kinetics, dynamics, and stability that will be invaluable to anyone with a college-level mathematics background wishing to develop an understanding of nuclear power. From fuels and reactions to full systems and plants, the author provides a clear picture of how nuclear energy works, how it can be optimized for safety and efficiency, and why it is important to the future.\r\n\r\n---\r\n <a href=\"\nhttp://dlfeb.com/book/neutronic-analysis-for-nuclear-reactor-systems/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttp://dlfeb.com/book/neutronic-analysis-for-nuclear-reactor-systems/</a>","last_updated":"2017-06-15T12:00:33.307Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8fff2ed3c41997fcc960a9e12d0ca5b580dd58b","dn":"NEUTRONIC ANALYSIS FOR NUCLEAR REACTOR SYSTEMS","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"a8fff2ed3c41997fcc960a9e12d0ca5b580dd58b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,255,242,237,60,65,153,127,204,150,10,158,18,208,202,91,88,13,213,139]},"name":"NEUTRONIC ANALYSIS FOR NUCLEAR REACTOR SYSTEMS","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
