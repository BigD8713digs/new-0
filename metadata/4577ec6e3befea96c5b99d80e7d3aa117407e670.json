While the Final Solution was a unique and unparalleled horror, German atrocities did not end there. The Nazis terrorized their own citizens, tortured and murdered POWs, and carried out countless executions throughout occupied Europe. Lord Russell of Liverpool was part of the legal team that brought Nazi war criminals to justice, and from this first-hand position, he published the sensational, best-selling The Scourge of the Swastika in 1954. Liverpool shows that the actions of the Third Reich, including the Holocaust, were illegal, not merely immoral.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-10-31T12:04:59.625Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:4577ec6e3befea96c5b99d80e7d3aa117407e670","dn":"The Scourge of the Swastika by Lord Russell of Liverpool MOBI","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"4577ec6e3befea96c5b99d80e7d3aa117407e670","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,119,236,110,59,239,234,150,197,185,157,128,231,211,170,17,116,7,230,112]},"name":"The Scourge of the Swastika by Lord Russell of Liverpool MOBI","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
