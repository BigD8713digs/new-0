Brits Bevan and Lash, American Morris and Australian Buck are all major players on the world stage, experienced in out-sounds ranging from raucous free-jazz to minimal improv. and touching on points in between. Here, they strap in for a blazing live set (recorded with a slightly cavernous auditorium ambience) that rides the finest of lines between abstraction and all-out swing. Morris&#x2019;s electric guitar has the kind of brittle, unadorned twang commonly associated with Jazz, which, coupled with the rhythm section&#x2019;s fragmented, up-tempo bluster, gives the date a super-charged Charlie Christian set as imagined by Pablo Picasso. Morris and Bevan leave plenty of room for each other&#x2019;s solo spots and when it&#x2019;s the saxophonist&#x2019;s turn to take the reins, his gruff tenor feels like a nod to Albert Ayler&#x2019;s bar-walking days in roadhouse R&amp;B bands. This should be required listening for anyone who thinks improvisation can&#x2019;t shake its tail feathers. - Daniel Spicer, Jazzwise","last_updated":"2017-08-13T12:03:36.761Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:f52e7529ec0d765193a8ff2ed9221d2292b00d12","dn":"Bevan, Morris, Buck, Lash 2012 Tony-Joe Bucklash","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"f52e7529ec0d765193a8ff2ed9221d2292b00d12","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,46,117,41,236,13,118,81,147,168,255,46,217,34,29,34,146,176,13,18]},"name":"Bevan, Morris, Buck, Lash 2012 Tony-Joe Bucklash","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
