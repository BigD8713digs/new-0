Protecting your online privacy can only be achieved by additional software tools that can hide your location and can prevent your online information and browsing habits from being revealed to anyone. If youre ever in need of such a tool, Tor Browser Bundle is one suggestion you can add to the list.\r\n\r\n\r\nVidalia&#x2019;s interface encases a collection of shortcuts that allow you to stop the service, to start setting up the relays, to trigger a global view of the network and most important of all, it sports a button for using a new identity any time you wish. If you&#x2019;re interested in bandwidth usage, Vidalia features a separate utility just for showing a bandwidth graph that measures the receive/send rate of the packets.\r\n\r\nThe portable Firefox version included in the download package is customized with a few extensions that make the anonymous surfing experience easier. These include: Torbutton - allows you to create a new identity each time you start a browsing session, NoScript - blocks scripts from untrusted domains and HTTPS Everywhere - enables you to encrypt the communication with a lot of popular sites.\r\n\r\nWith all the components it encases, Tor Browser Bundle is one of the most trustworthy anonymous surfing tools out there. It can be configured from command prompt, run from its dedicated GUI controller - Vidalia and comes with a pre-configured web browser. Whichever of these methods you choose the result is a safe and controlled Internet browsing experience.\r\n\r\nDeveloper&#xA0;: torproject&#xA0;\r\nLicense&#xA0;: FreeWare&#xA0;\r\nLanguage&#xA0;: Multi&#xA0;\r\nSize&#xA0;: 51 MB&#xA0;\r\nOS&#xA0;: Windows&#xA0;","last_updated":"2017-11-15T12:07:14.192Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:e030fc06df7e86de2d35f9b241219321cb52a243","dn":"Tor Browser Bundle 7.0.10 {Ltest}","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"e030fc06df7e86de2d35f9b241219321cb52a243","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,48,252,6,223,126,134,222,45,53,249,178,65,33,147,33,203,82,162,67]},"name":"Tor Browser Bundle 7.0.10 {Ltest}","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
