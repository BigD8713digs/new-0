Sharp guy that he is, Adams realizes the bulk of the record can&apos;t all be brokenhearted strums, so not all of 1989 glimmers in a flat black pool. &quot;All You Had to Do Was Stay&quot; surges to a Modern Rock pulse, but he cheekily inverts the exuberance of &quot;Shake It Off,&quot; strips the T&apos;Pau and Chvrches out of &quot;Out of the Woods,&quot; and softens the steely &quot;Blank Space,&quot; thereby turning the first three singles into laments. Nevertheless, there&apos;s no disguising how Ryan Adams flips Taylor Swift&apos;s 1989 upside-down, turning a moment of triumph into bedsit introspection, a concept that is undoubtedly theoretically interesting, but the record works because Adams doesn&apos;t play this as a stunt. He&apos;s as canny a producer as he is a conceptualist, coaxing forgotten college rock sounds out of his Pax-Am Studios and treating Swift&apos;s originals as text to be interpreted, a move that neither saves nor strengthens the originals but rather highlights the skill of Taylor the songwriter and Adams the musician","last_updated":"2018-06-15T12:18:53.477Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:199a8b114c34b4729bbd7241d36570cf12ef5b5d","dn":"Ryan Adams - 1989 (2015) [24.96 FLAC] vinyl","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"199a8b114c34b4729bbd7241d36570cf12ef5b5d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,154,139,17,76,52,180,114,155,189,114,65,211,101,112,207,18,239,91,93]},"name":"Ryan Adams - 1989 (2015) [24.96 FLAC] vinyl","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
