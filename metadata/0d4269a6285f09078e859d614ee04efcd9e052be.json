It allows for new usage scenarios and applications that have not been possible with current remote desktop software.\r\n\r\nAnyDesk was designed from the ground up to be ground breaking. At its core is DeskRT, a new video codec that is specifically designed for graphical user interfaces. Thats why AnyDesk is one leap ahead.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\nNo Borders\r\n- Our worldwide server network provides an easy, fast, and secure connection from anywhere.\r\nNo Lags\r\n- AnyDesk connections are being routed over Erlang-based servers. This technology is widely used in large and ro&#xAD;bust tele&#xAD;commu&#xAD;ni&#xAD;cation sys&#xAD;tems.\r\nNo Limits\r\n- AnyDesk is the first remote desktop software that doesn&apos;t require you to think about what you can do. CAD, video editing or simply working comfortably with an office suite for hours are just a few examples.\r\nSecure\r\n- Both ends of a connection are cryptographically verified so no one can take over your AnyDesk-ID and pretend to be you.\r\nLightweight\r\n- AnyDesk will turn any desktop into your desktop in se&#xAD;conds. No administrative privileges or installation needed.\r\n\r\nDownload:\r\n\r\nAnyDesk 4.2.2 Multilingual for Windows !{Latest}","last_updated":"2018-07-21T12:09:44.203Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d4269a6285f09078e859d614ee04efcd9e052be","dn":"AnyDesk 4.2.2 Multilingual for Windows !{Latest}","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"0d4269a6285f09078e859d614ee04efcd9e052be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,66,105,166,40,95,9,7,142,133,157,97,78,224,78,252,217,224,82,190]},"name":"AnyDesk 4.2.2 Multilingual for Windows !{Latest}","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
