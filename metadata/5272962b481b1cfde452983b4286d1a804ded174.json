Endearingly ignorant Peter and his stay-at-home wife Lois reside in Quahog, R.I., and have three kids. Meg, the eldest child, is a social outcast, and teenage Chris is awkward and clueless when it comes to the opposite sex. The youngest, Stewie, is a genius baby bent on killing his mother and destroying the world. The talking dog, Brian, keeps Stewie in check while sipping martinis and sorting through his own life issues.\r\n\r\nProgram creator: Seth MacFarlane\r\nTheme song: Family Guy Theme Song\r\nDid you know: &quot;Family Guy&quot; is the sixth-longest-running scripted primetime TV series in the US (16 seasons)","last_updated":"2017-12-04T12:08:01.855Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:5272962b481b1cfde452983b4286d1a804ded174","dn":"Family.Guy.S16E08.WEB.x264.[Season.16.Episode.8]","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"5272962b481b1cfde452983b4286d1a804ded174","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,114,150,43,72,27,28,253,228,82,152,59,66,134,209,168,4,222,209,116]},"name":"Family.Guy.S16E08.WEB.x264.[Season.16.Episode.8]","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
