But this is only the beginning. Your new body needs a new nutrition plan&#x2014;starting now.\r\n\r\nThe decision to have bariatric surgery is a life-changing one. Though not an all-in-one solution, for many people it marks a profound moment in their journey towards renewed health. According to the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery (ASMBS), factors such as rethinking nutrition and modifying what you eat will play a vital role in determining your long-term weight loss success. But where do you begin?\r\n\r\nBariatric dietician Sarah Kent helps bariatric patients by providing a range of pre- and post-operative nutritional services. Sarah knows how important it is&#x2014;and how challenging it can seem&#x2014;to rethink the way you eat. She also knows it&#x2019;s totally possible, as do the hundreds of bariatric surgery patients who&#x2019;ve benefitted from her support groups at Froedtert Hospital&#x2019;s accredited Center of Excellence for bariatric surgery.\r\n\r\nWith that in mind, Sarah sought out to create a bariatric cookbook that was easy to use, so you can get started right away. In Fresh Start Bariatric Cookbook, Sarah offers healthy, delicious takes on your favorite foods, so you can eat what you love without the fear of undoing the results of your surgery","last_updated":"2017-08-06T12:00:38.911Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:db6e5c44e6557ae0c84c1c610a9be1f83fbe41ec","dn":"Freart Bariatric Cookbook (2017) (Azw3) Gooner","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"db6e5c44e6557ae0c84c1c610a9be1f83fbe41ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,110,92,68,230,85,122,224,200,76,28,97,10,155,225,248,63,190,65,236]},"name":"Freart Bariatric Cookbook (2017) (Azw3) Gooner","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
