In fact she never thought she would escape her small and peculiar hometown. When We Were Animals is Lumen&apos;s confessional: As a well-behaved and overachieving teenager, she fell beneath the sway of her community&apos;s darkest, strangest secret. For one year, beginning at puberty, every resident &quot;breaches&quot; during the full moon. On these nights adolescents run wild, destroying everything in their paths.\r\n\r\nLumen resists. Promising her father she will never breach, she investigates the mystery of her community&apos;s traditions and the stories erased from the town record. But the more we learn about the town&apos;s past, the more we realize that Lumen&apos;s memories are harboring secrets of their own.\r\n\r\nA gothic coming-of-age tale for modern times, When We Were Animals is a dark, provocative journey into the American heartland.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-06-17T12:03:36.514Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:e123f1dcf0738da72e16e08ba53befa426e97889","dn":"When We Were Animals by Joshua Gaylord EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"e123f1dcf0738da72e16e08ba53befa426e97889","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,35,241,220,240,115,141,167,46,22,224,139,165,59,239,164,38,233,120,137]},"name":"When We Were Animals by Joshua Gaylord EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
