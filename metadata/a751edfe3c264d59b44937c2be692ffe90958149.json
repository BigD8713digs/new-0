But Val&apos;s true mutiny was when she moved to China, the land her parents had fled. In 1998, Val arrives in Beijing expecting to find freedom - but she finds her traditional relatives instead. She discovers a city rebelling against its roots, struggling to find a new, modern identity like her. A thriving avant-garde subculture makes art out of the chaos in Beijing&apos;s gritty outskirts.\r\n\r\nBrilliantly observed and winningly told, Beijing Bastard is a compelling story of a young woman finding her place in the world and of China, as its ancient past gives way to a dazzling but uncertain future","last_updated":"2018-08-26T12:12:56.338Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:a751edfe3c264d59b44937c2be692ffe90958149","dn":"Beijing Bastard_ Into the Wilds of a Changing China","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"a751edfe3c264d59b44937c2be692ffe90958149","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,81,237,254,60,38,77,89,180,73,55,194,190,105,47,254,144,149,129,73]},"name":"Beijing Bastard_ Into the Wilds of a Changing China","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
