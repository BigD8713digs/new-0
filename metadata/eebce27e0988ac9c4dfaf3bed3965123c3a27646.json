All of a sudden it was acceptable to brag, so long as those brags were ever-so-thinly disguised as transparent humility, such as:\r\n\r\n&quot;Just filed my taxes. Biggie was right, mo money mo problems.&quot;\r\n\r\n&quot;I hate when I go into a store to get something to eat and the male staff are too busy hitting on me to get my order right :( so annoying!&quot;\r\n\r\nTaking action by naming this phenomenon and creating the Twitter account called Humblebrag - dedicated solely to retweeting the humblebrags of others - Wittels&apos;s new word took the Internet by storm. Harris also shows readers what humblebrags might look like from some of history&apos;s most notable names, as well as devoting an entire chapter to a man who just might be the greatest humblebraggart of them all...\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-06-03T12:11:13.807Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:eebce27e0988ac9c4dfaf3bed3965123c3a27646","dn":"Humblebrag: The Art of False Modesty by Harris Wittels EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"eebce27e0988ac9c4dfaf3bed3965123c3a27646","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,188,226,126,9,136,172,156,77,250,243,190,211,150,81,35,195,162,118,70]},"name":"Humblebrag: The Art of False Modesty by Harris Wittels EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
