This is a fascinating tale-and potentially the first-to describe the work of American contractors, men who run highly dangerous missions deep inside foreign countries on the brink of war. It will lift the veil and detail the ultimate danger and risk of paramilitary operations (both officially government-sanctioned and not) and show us in very intimate terms exactly what private soldiers do when the government can&apos;t act or take public responsibility. GRAY WORK combines covert military intelligence with boots-on-the-ground realism, following Jamie Smith through his CIA training and work as a spy in the State Department, to his co-founding of Blackwater following 9/11, to his decision to leave that company","last_updated":"2018-04-25T12:09:45.316Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:123d40de87fdbd103cf119961a10ee9236b8fb91","dn":"Gray.Work.by.Jamie.Smith.EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"123d40de87fdbd103cf119961a10ee9236b8fb91","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,61,64,222,135,253,189,16,60,241,25,150,26,16,238,146,54,184,251,145]},"name":"Gray.Work.by.Jamie.Smith.EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
