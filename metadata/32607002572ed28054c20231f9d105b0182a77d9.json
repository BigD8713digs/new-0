His name was Alton Turner Blackwood, and in the space of a few months he brutally murdered four families. His savage spree ended only when he himself was killed by the last survivor of the last family, a fourteen year old boy.\r\n\r\nHalf a continent away and two decades later, someone is murdering families again, recreating in detail Blackwood&#x2019;s crimes. Homicide detective John Calvino is certain that his own family his wife and three children will be targets in the fourth crime, just as his parents and sisters were victims on that distant night when he was fourteen and killed their slayer.\r\n\r\nAs a detective, John is a man of reason who deals in cold facts. But an extraordinary experience convinces him that sometimes death is not a one way journey, that sometimes the dead return.\r\n\r\n\r\nRead by: Steven Weber\r\n\r\nFormat: Stereo mp3\r\n\r\nBit Rate: 128Kbps/44.1Hz\r\n\r\n\r\nRemember to tip your uploader and seed! :)","last_updated":"2018-06-03T12:13:30.949Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:32607002572ed28054c20231f9d105b0182a77d9","dn":"What the Night Knows - Dean Koontz","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"32607002572ed28054c20231f9d105b0182a77d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,96,112,2,87,46,210,128,84,194,2,49,249,209,5,176,24,42,119,217]},"name":"What the Night Knows - Dean Koontz","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
