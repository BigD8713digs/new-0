LANs and WANs are necessary to connect the computers in an organization: to each other, to printers and servers, to the Internet, and to the world. Whether you need to set up a simple LAN at your home or a complicated cable system for an entire office, this course will provide the training you need to set up different kinds of networks. Author Greg Sowell introduces the various network cables and connectors, from coaxial to Cat 5, and discusses how to set up a wireless network, including coverage of the 802.11 standards and security considerations. Need to &quot;go long&quot;? The course concludes with coverage of fiber-optic media, which improves data transmission over long distances.\r\nTopics include:\r\nExploring cable types\r\nCreating coaxial cable\r\nTerminating Cat 5 cable\r\nMitigating EMI\r\nSetting up wireless LANs\r\nComparing Wi-Fi frequencies\r\nSecuring a wireless network\r\nUsing fiber-optic cable in LAN and WAN applications","last_updated":"2017-07-16T12:04:15.133Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:54369bd5acf1da3f5138404024ac79a57a4941cf","dn":"Lynda - Networking Foundations Network Media (LANs)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"54369bd5acf1da3f5138404024ac79a57a4941cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,54,155,213,172,241,218,63,81,56,64,64,36,172,121,165,122,73,65,207]},"name":"Lynda - Networking Foundations Network Media (LANs)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
