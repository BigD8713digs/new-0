D. Robb EPUB\r\n\r\nThe chic Manhattan nightspot called Du Vin has a French theme-though it&apos;s actually owned by an Irishman who just happens to be married to the NYPSD&apos;s Lieutenant Eve Dallas. Du Vin is not the kind of place Dallas would usually patronize, and it&apos;s definitely not the kind of bar where a lot of blood gets spilled. But that&apos;s exactly what happens one cold February evening. \r\n\r\nThe mortally wounded woman who stumbles out of the ladies&apos; room is Larinda Mars, a self-described &quot;social information reporter&quot; or, as most people would call it, a professional gossip. As it turns out, she wasn&apos;t publicly sharing all the dirt she dug up. She kept the best, most shocking stories quiet for profitable use in her side business as a blackmailer. Setting her sights on rich, prominent marks, she&apos;d find out what they most wanted to keep hidden and then bleed them dry. Now someone&apos;s done the same to her, literally-with a knife to the brachial artery. \r\n\r\nEve didn&apos;t like Larinda Mars. But she likes murder even less. To find justice for this victim, she&apos;ll have to plunge into the dirty little secrets of all the people Larinda Mars victimized. Along the way, she may be exposed to some information she really didn&apos;t want to know.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-11-08T12:18:21.294Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e3f2a8a35ec7b7aab7fbe6411a49d8ae66120e6","dn":"Secrets in Death by J.
