From this knowledge a deeper understanding of the fundamental requirements and the potential performance, as well as limitations of such systems may be assessed, given the appropriate operational parameters. Engineers and students are provided with practical advice on how to evaluate laser devices and systems, operate them safely, and train with them.\r\n\r\n---\r\n <a href=\"\nhttp://dlfeb.com/book/military-laser-technology-and-systems/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttp://dlfeb.com/book/military-laser-technology-and-systems/</a>","last_updated":"2017-07-22T12:04:08.453Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f83e32ddcf20084c10d1927eaf0f635362fd88e","dn":"MILITARY LASENOLOGY AND SYSTEMS","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"7f83e32ddcf20084c10d1927eaf0f635362fd88e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,131,227,45,220,242,0,132,193,13,25,39,234,240,246,53,54,47,216,142]},"name":"MILITARY LASENOLOGY AND SYSTEMS","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
