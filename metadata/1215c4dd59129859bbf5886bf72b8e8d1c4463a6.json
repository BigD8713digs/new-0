Many come directly from refugee camps, and some arrive alone, having left or lost every other member of their family. Their stories are poignant and remarkable, and at the center of their combined story is Mr. Williams: the dedicated and endlessly resourceful teacher of their English Language Acquisition class - a class which was created specifically for them and which will provide them with the foundation they need to face the enormous challenges of adapting to life in America.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-11-25T12:59:10.674Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:1215c4dd59129859bbf5886bf72b8e8d1c4463a6","dn":"The Newcomers by Helen Thorpe EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"1215c4dd59129859bbf5886bf72b8e8d1c4463a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,21,196,221,89,18,152,89,187,245,136,107,247,43,142,141,28,68,99,166]},"name":"The Newcomers by Helen Thorpe EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
