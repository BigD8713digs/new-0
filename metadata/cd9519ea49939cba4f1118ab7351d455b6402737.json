His purchaser is the infamous gourmet Marcus Gavius Apicius, wealthy beyond measure, obsessed with a taste for fine meals from exotic places and a singular ambition: to serve as culinary adviser to Caesar, an honor that will cement his legacy as Rome&apos;s leading epicure.\r\n\r\nApicius rightfully believes that Thrasius is the key to his culinary success, and with Thrasius&apos; help he soon becomes known for his lavish parties and fantastic meals. Thrasius finds a family in Apicius&apos; household, his daughter Apicata, his wife Aelia, and her handmaiden, Passia, whom Thrasius quickly falls in love with. But as Apicius draws closer to his ultimate goal, his reckless disregard for any who might get in his way takes a dangerous turn that threatens his young family and places his entire household at the mercy of the most powerful forces in Rome.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-09-02T12:05:27.351Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd9519ea49939cba4f1118ab7351d455b6402737","dn":"Feast of Sorrow_ A Novel of Ancient Rome by Crystal King ePUB eB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"cd9519ea49939cba4f1118ab7351d455b6402737","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,149,25,234,73,147,156,186,79,17,24,171,115,81,212,85,182,64,39,55]},"name":"Feast of Sorrow_ A Novel of Ancient Rome by Crystal King ePUB eB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
