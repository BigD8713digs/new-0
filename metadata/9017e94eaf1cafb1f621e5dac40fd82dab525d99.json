For their first challenge, the chefs have 30 minutes to prepare an outrageous six-foot-long lobster roll. Judges Damaris Phillips and Jamika Pessoa are joined by Lazarus Lynch to choose their favorite lobster roll, and the winning chef gets access to the special cooler in the second heat. Next up, Eddie challenges the chefs to present the judges with a 60-minute seafood feast. At the end of the round, the judges send one chef packing, while the final four move one step closer to $25,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal Air Date: 12-Aug-2018","last_updated":"2018-08-15T21:20:00.092Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:9017e94eaf1cafb1f621e5dac40fd82dab525d99","dn":"Ultimate.Summer.Cook-Off.S01E02.Seafood.Spectacular.WEB.h264-CAF","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"9017e94eaf1cafb1f621e5dac40fd82dab525d99","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,23,233,78,175,28,175,177,246,33,229,218,196,15,216,45,171,82,93,153]},"name":"Ultimate.Summer.Cook-Off.S01E02.Seafood.Spectacular.WEB.h264-CAF","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
