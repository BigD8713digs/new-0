In the months following the publication of her most recent book, The Secret Lives of Wives, Krasnow addressed thousands of women, and she discovered that two subjects dominated her audiences&apos; conversations: sex and change. Whether women are worried about marriage and divorce or illness and death, they&apos;re all asking: &quot;How do I handle the shifts in my sexuality caused by these events?&quot; Sex After . . . holds the answers to everything from regaining sexual confidence after childbirth and breast cancer to navigating the dating scene in senior communities.\r\n\r\nAs with all of Krasnow&apos;s books since her New York Times bestseller Surrendering to Marriage, the narrative is driven by real women&apos;s stories: raw, intimate, and, most importantly, true.
