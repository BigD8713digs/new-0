We will create two different effects in this course, one based off of a dynamic Pyro sim, and one using curl noise to wash particles around a surface. After simulating, we&apos;ll take our particles even farther by shading, shaping, and lighting them based on data derived from the sims themselves. You&apos;ll be making professional looking advanced particle sims in no time!\r\n\r\nApplied Houdini is a production quality oriented series created by Stevencurrently a Senior Rigid Body Destruction / FX Technical Director at Lucasfilm&apos;s Industrial Light &amp; Magic (Star Wars: The Last Jedi, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, Star Wars: The Force Awakens). Benefit from production proven workflows while also getting an in depth explanation of why things works they way they do. Best of all - each video is crammed with actual information and footnotes instead of gratuitous talking and dead space!\r\n\r\nTable of Contents","last_updated":"2018-08-26T12:02:08.707Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7928a015ad40bfc300a36952d4b4a25e57692b9","dn":"CGCircuit - Applied Houdini Particles II 2018","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"b7928a015ad40bfc300a36952d4b4a25e57692b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,146,138,1,90,212,11,252,48,10,54,149,45,75,74,37,229,118,146,185]},"name":"CGCircuit - Applied Houdini Particles II 2018","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
