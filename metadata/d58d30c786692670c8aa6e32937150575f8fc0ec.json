I know the guys that she is a copy of another famous software, we all know this, I still do not understand the logic myself, but consider that this is the usual product for you, only a little differently, by the way, I like this design more. So, it can find the driver and update it, can make a backup of the drivers and after recovering them, can completely uninstall the driver if it is allowed to curve or conflict. I rarely use this software myself, I have a program in its priority, but it&apos;s not about that. Perhaps I will not paint anymore, the main message is clear, the meaning is also good luck in the update. \r\n\r\nHow to Install: \r\n1). Instructions are included in ReadMe.txt if needed. \r\n2). Thats all, Done &amp; enjoy","last_updated":"2017-07-31T12:02:23.212Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:d58d30c786692670c8aa6e32937150575f8fc0ec","dn":"TweakBit Driver Updater v1.8.2.3   Patch","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"d58d30c786692670c8aa6e32937150575f8fc0ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,141,48,199,134,105,38,112,200,170,110,50,147,113,80,87,95,143,192,236]},"name":"TweakBit Driver Updater v1.8.2.3   Patch","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
