Until now. One year - almost to the day - from Ro&apos;s death, when he knocks on the door of Blue Gate Manor and asks where she is.\r\n\r\nCage has no memory of the past 12 months. According to him, Ro was alive only the day before. Ro&apos;s sister Mae wouldn&apos;t believe him, except that something&apos;s not right. Nothing&apos;s been right in the house since Ro died.\r\n\r\nAnd then Mae finds the little green book. The one hidden in Ro&apos;s room. It&apos;s filled with secrets - dangerous secrets - about her family, and about Ro. And if what it says is true, then maybe, just maybe, Ro isn&apos;t lost forever.\r\n\r\nAnd maybe there are secrets so dark, they should never see the light of day.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-11-24T12:00:41.224Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:4920f9b7bfb1cae08adf18921fca0c5f89437b0d","dn":"The Breathless by Tara Goedjen EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"4920f9b7bfb1cae08adf18921fca0c5f89437b0d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,32,249,183,191,177,202,224,138,223,24,146,31,202,12,95,137,67,123,13]},"name":"The Breathless by Tara Goedjen EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
