Reviews for his second novel, The Rise and Fall of Great Powers, were no less rapturous, with the New York Times calling it &quot;ingenious&quot;.\r\n\r\nNow, in the shadows of a seismic shift in American politics, comes his timely and hilarious new work. Basket of Deplorables takes an incisive and satirical look at the United States in the era of Trump data breaches, liberal self-righteousness, red-hat rancor, Starbucks macchiatos, Ultimate Fighting factories, and Internet sinkholes.\r\n\r\nWritten for Audible and featuring a shifting array of disparate voices, the five intricately linked stories take readers from an Election Night party in Manhattan to a funeral populated by fake mourners in Lansing, Michigan, to an online date in an era when every email platform in the world has been hacked and, ultimately, to a reality where the impossible, the unthinkable, becomes all too real.\r\n\r\nIn Basket of Deplorables, Rachman has created an urgent and deeply satisfying work that will continue to cement his place among the great literary stylists and cultural observers of our time.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-09-03T12:00:25.911Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:35767bf9e686fd4179fbcf33a3323bbb7d5c147f","dn":"Basket of Deplorables by Tom Rachman ePUB eBOOK-ZAK","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"35767bf9e686fd4179fbcf33a3323bbb7d5c147f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,118,123,249,230,134,253,65,121,251,207,51,163,50,59,187,125,92,20,127]},"name":"Basket of Deplorables by Tom Rachman ePUB eBOOK-ZAK","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
