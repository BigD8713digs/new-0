The title curse surfaces when a mute servant girl \r\nbears a child on Christmas day after being raped by a bestial madman and \r\nfirst shows itself at the infant&apos;s christening, whereupon the holy water \r\nbegins to boil. Things go downhill from there, as young Leon&apos;s development is \r\nmarred by savage, violent behavior during a full moon. Upon adulthood, Leon&apos;s \r\n(Oliver Reed) only relief from his murderous impulses comes from the love of \r\nChristina (Catherine Feller)... but he soon begins to fear that this cannot \r\ncontain the beast within. Liberally based on Guy Endore&apos;s The Werewolf of \r\nParis (here relocated to Spain), this film represents Hammer at their early \r\nbest, building tension through mood and character (Reed turns in a bravura \r\nperformance) and saving the effective monster transformation for the climax","last_updated":"2017-06-05T12:00:58.269Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:dcbdc6439bb03730d75c1722ffe8279b62f59bf7","dn":"The Curse Of The Werewolf - Hammer Horror 1961 Eng Subs 1080p [H","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"dcbdc6439bb03730d75c1722ffe8279b62f59bf7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,189,198,67,155,176,55,48,215,92,23,34,255,232,39,155,98,245,155,247]},"name":"The Curse Of The Werewolf - Hammer Horror 1961 Eng Subs 1080p [H","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
