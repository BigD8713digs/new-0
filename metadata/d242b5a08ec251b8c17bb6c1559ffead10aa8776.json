Which self-deceptions,\r\n\r\nwhen considering ourselves as actors on the world stage, do we cling to most\r\n\r\ntenaciously? Why do we so stubbornly believe, for example, that our country\r\n\r\nalways means well when intervening abroad?  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Tunnel at the End of the Light argues that some of our most persistent and\r\n\r\ndestructive assumptions, in that regard, might come from the movies. In these\r\n\r\nten essays Jim Shepard weaves close readings of film with cultural criticism\r\n\r\nto explore the ways in which movies work so ubiquitously to reflect how\r\n\r\nAmericans think and act. Whether assessing the &#x201C;high-spirited glee of American\r\n\r\nruthlessness&#x201D; captured in GoodFellas, or finding in Lawrence of Arabia a\r\n\r\n&#x201C;portrait of the lunatic serenity of our leaders&#x2019; conviction in the face of\r\n\r\nall evidence and their own lack of knowledge,&#x201D; he explores how we enter into\r\n\r\nconversations with specific genres and films&#x2014;Chinatown, The Third Man, and\r\n\r\nBadlands among others&#x2014;in order to construct and refine our most cherished\r\n\r\nillusions about ourselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAuthor Info:\r\n\r\nJim Shepard is the author of seven novels, including most recently The Book of\r\n\r\nAron, which won the Sophie Brody Medal for Achievement in Jewish Literature\r\n\r\nfrom the American Library Association and the PEN/New England Award for\r\n\r\nfiction, and five story collections, including his new collection, The World\r\n\r\nTo Come. Five of his short stories have been chosen for the Best American\r\n\r\nShort Stories, two for the PEN/O. Henry Prize Stories, and one for a Pushcart\r\n\r\nPrize. He teaches at Williams College.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCover: <a href=\"\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/books/1498929813l/34445201.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/books/1498929813l/34445201.jpg</a>\r\n\r\n <a href=\"\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34445201\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34445201</a>","last_updated":"2017-09-15T12:03:52.062Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:d242b5a08ec251b8c17bb6c1559ffead10aa8776","dn":"The Tunnel at the End of the Light - Jim Shepard.epub","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"d242b5a08ec251b8c17bb6c1559ffead10aa8776","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,66,181,160,142,194,81,184,193,123,182,193,85,159,254,173,16,170,135,118]},"name":"The Tunnel at the End of the Light - Jim Shepard.epub","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
