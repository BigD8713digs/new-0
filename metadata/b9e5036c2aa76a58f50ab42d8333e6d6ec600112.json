As the forces of globalization, automation, and artificial intelligence combine to disrupt every field career, having a good idea isn&#x2019;t good enough. Mastering the ancient art of persuasion is the key to standing out, getting ahead, and achieving greatness in the modern world. Communication is no longer a &#x201C;soft&#x201D; skill - it is the human edge that will make you unstoppable, irresistible, and irreplaceable - earning you that perfect rating, that fifth star. \r\n\r\nIn Five Stars, Carmine Gallo, bestselling author of Talk like TED, breaks down how to apply Aristotle&#x2019;s formula of persuasion to inspire contemporary audiences. As the nature of work changes, and technology carries things across the globe in a moment, communication skills become more valuable - not less. Gallo interviews neuroscientists, economists, historians, billionaires, and business leaders of companies like Google, Nike, and Airbnb to show first-hand how they use their words to captivate your imagination and ignite your dreams. \r\n\r\nIn the knowledge age - the information economy - you are only as valuable as your ideas. Five Stars is a book to help readers bridge the gap between mediocrity and exceptionality, and gain the competitive edge in the age of automation. \r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-06-11T12:01:09.076Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9e5036c2aa76a58f50ab42d8333e6d6ec600112","dn":"Five Stars by Carmine Gallo EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"b9e5036c2aa76a58f50ab42d8333e6d6ec600112","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,229,3,108,42,167,106,88,245,10,180,45,131,51,230,214,236,96,1,18]},"name":"Five Stars by Carmine Gallo EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
