Tracks like the shimmering &quot;Lose That Girl&quot; and the swirling &quot;Erica America&quot; show Saint Etienne at its melancholic best. \r\nThere are, predictably, some near misses such as the Beatlesque &quot;Mr. Donut,&quot; which is as sweet as a strawberry field but fails to deliver the melodic promises made by the smart atmospherics. &quot;Goodnight Jack,&quot; with its pastel-shaded flute loops and subtle breakbeats, has a positively cooler-than-cool feel and a wrenching change of pace toward the middle of the song. \r\nSure, Good Humor is clever, perhaps overly so, and yeah, it&apos;s full of the Et&apos;s contrived coyness and we-know-more-than-you attitude, but it&apos;s good stuff. Sometimes you just want to put on a disc, sit back, and let it carry you off to someplace else. If that&apos;s all you&apos;re looking for, Good Humor is sweet ear candy.
