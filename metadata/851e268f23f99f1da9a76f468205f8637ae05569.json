In this course Nick Brazzi explains how reddit works, how it is organized, and how you can set up an account to contribute to the community. He covers both the web-based and mobile platforms, demystifies common reddit abbreviations and jargon, and shows how to effectively search and navigate subreddits. Plus, learn how to post and vote on content, and use the &quot;Ask Me Anything,&quot; or AMA, subreddit, which features politicians, celebrities, scientists, and other interesting people who are willing to answer questions posed by redditors.\r\nTopics include:\r\nReading articles on reddit\r\nSearching reddit\r\nUsing the Reddit Enhancement Suite\r\nPosting content\r\nCommenting and voting on content","last_updated":"2017-07-02T12:00:26.242Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:851e268f23f99f1da9a76f468205f8637ae05569","dn":"Lynda - Learning reddit","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"851e268f23f99f1da9a76f468205f8637ae05569","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,30,38,143,35,249,159,29,169,167,111,70,130,5,248,99,122,224,85,105]},"name":"Lynda - Learning reddit","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
