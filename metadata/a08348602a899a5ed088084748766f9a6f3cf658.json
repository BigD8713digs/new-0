Del initially declines the offer, but ultimately agrees in exchange for &#xA3;15,000. When Del learns that DCI Roy Slater is aware of the cases of diamond smuggling, but does not know who is involved, and realising that he wouldn&apos;t get the diamonds through airport security, Del gets Uncle Albert to take him and Rodney to Amsterdam from Hull in a hired boat. The Trotters arrive at the location and collect the diamonds. Meanwhile, back at the police station, Slater deduces that Boycie and Del are involved in the smuggling and waits at the airport for the Trotters to arrive. Del, Rodney and Albert arrive back a day late because Albert got lost. All seems to have gone well until Slater catches Boycie and the Trotters in the act. However, Slater lets them case go and is later arrested when the police work out that he has been working with the man in Amsterdam who keeps the diamonds until the couriers arrive. Although Boycie used fake money to pay for the diamonds, he paid Del with real money. Unfortunately, Del thinks the money is fake and throws it out the window","last_updated":"2017-05-06T18:10:47.752Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:a08348602a899a5ed088084748766f9a6f3cf658","dn":"Only Fools and Horses Special - To Hull and Back (1985) Gooner","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"a08348602a899a5ed088084748766f9a6f3cf658","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,131,72,96,42,137,154,94,208,136,8,71,72,118,111,154,111,60,246,88]},"name":"Only Fools and Horses Special - To Hull and Back (1985) Gooner","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
