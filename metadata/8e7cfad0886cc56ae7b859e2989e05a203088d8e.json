In addition, the use of Machine Learning computer algorithms to predict whether an individual is a threat or not will be discussed using moral theories. The ever growing practice of using computer software to deceive the public will be evaluated and the consequences that come after. This writing will also showcase on the moral reasoning why someone caught up in a moral dilemma should do.
