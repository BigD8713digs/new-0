There really are no ultimate authority figures-no one has the secret, and there is no place to look up the definitive answers to our questions (not even Google). \r\n\r\nLuckily, THE SKEPTICS&apos; GUIDE TO THE UNIVERSE is your map through this maze of modern life. Here Dr. Steven Novella-along with Bob Novella, Cara Santa Maria, Jay Novella, and Evan Bernstein-will explain the tenets of skeptical thinking and debunk some of the biggest scientific myths, fallacies, and conspiracy theories-from anti-vaccines to homeopathy, UFO sightings to N- rays. You&apos;ll learn the difference between science and pseudoscience, essential critical thinking skills, ways to discuss conspiracy theories with that crazy co- worker of yours, and how to combat sloppy reasoning, bad arguments, and superstitious thinking. \r\n\r\nGenre: Non-Fiction &gt; Educational","last_updated":"2018-10-03T12:25:06.439Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:eccd84900d61ec86cae8e73335bd7cfa3aaab4e2","dn":"The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe by Steven Novella (.epub)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"eccd84900d61ec86cae8e73335bd7cfa3aaab4e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,205,132,144,13,97,236,134,202,232,231,51,53,189,124,250,58,170,180,226]},"name":"The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe by Steven Novella (.epub)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
