Thalos rejects the premise that a theory of freedom is fundamentally a theory of the metaphysics of constraint and, instead, lays out a political conception of freedom that is closely aligned with questions of social identity, self-development in contexts of intimate relationships, and social solidarity. Thalos argues that whether a person is free (in any context) depends upon a certain relationship of fit between that agent&#x2019;s conception of themselves (both present and future), on the one hand, and the facts of their circumstances, on the other. Since relationships of fit are broadly logical, freedom is a logic&#x2014;it is the logic of fit between one&#x2019;s aspirations and one&#x2019;s circumstances, what Thalos calls the logic of agency.\r\n\r\nEnglish | ePUB |Educational | ISBN/ASIN: 1138931586|2 MB","last_updated":"2018-01-22T21:40:06.103Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:e00f244cfa97152f85ecc1dbc2962d1a0035a78c","dn":"A Social Theory of Freedom by Mariam Thalos","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"e00f244cfa97152f85ecc1dbc2962d1a0035a78c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,15,36,76,250,151,21,47,133,236,193,219,194,150,45,26,0,53,167,140]},"name":"A Social Theory of Freedom by Mariam Thalos","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
