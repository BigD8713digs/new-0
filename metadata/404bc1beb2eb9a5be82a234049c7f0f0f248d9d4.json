It describes the manufacture of base oils in refineries, and mentions the main additives playing an essential role in the quality of the marketed finished oils. The organization of the different systems of collecting in order to obtain a waste oil regenerable or used as fuel are explained. This book covers the main operations of physical and chemical treatments required in waste oil regeneration by covering the fundamental principles techniques such as vacuum distillation, solvent deasphalting, and ultrafiltration. A wide part is dedicated to applications with the description of about twenty processes. In addition, the book describes several types of energetic valorizations which concern a quite important fraction of the collected oil volume","last_updated":"2017-05-09T19:42:53.618Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:404bc1beb2eb9a5be82a234049c7f0f0f248d9d4","dn":"Waste Engine Oils - Rerefining and Energy Recovery","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"404bc1beb2eb9a5be82a234049c7f0f0f248d9d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,75,193,190,178,235,154,91,232,42,35,64,73,199,240,240,242,72,217,212]},"name":"Waste Engine Oils - Rerefining and Energy Recovery","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
