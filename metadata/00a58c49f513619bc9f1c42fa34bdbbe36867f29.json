I&apos;ve added songs that should have been on it but weren&apos;t, and put them in chronological order from the film. (Basically; the riff from track 6 is played more than once.)\r\n\r\nIf you&apos;re an audiophile who&apos;s watched Dumb and Dumber over 100 times, this is an ultimate collection.\r\n\r\nAll are in Apple Lossless Audio Codec, from several CDs, except the extremely rare 2 Ft O Butt Crack, which suddenly surfaced online in 2015. I included the highest quality version I could find. Boom Shack-A-Lak was from a promotional CD single distributed to radio stations.\r\n\r\n25913016 01 Boom Shack-A-Lak.m4a                                                32959892 02 Red Right Hand.m4a                                                  24406334 03 Get Ready.m4a                                                       31937032 04 Insomniac.m4a                                                        2447712  05 2 Ft O Butt Crack.m4a                                               41141956 06 Too Much of a Good Thing.m4a                                        13640662 07 The Rain, The Park &amp; Other Things.m4a                               30407786 08 The Ballad of Peter Pumpkinhead.m4a                                 20810308 09 The Bear Song.m4a                                                   24169208 10 Take.m4a                                                            26690627 11 Crash (95 mix).m4a                                                  28171868 12 Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm.m4a                                                 28030294 13 Where I Find My Heaven.m4a                                          27874024 14 You Sexy Thing.m4a                                                  19934096 15 Oh, Pretty Woman.m4a                                                25750871 16 New Age Girl.m4a                                                    29338251 17 If You Don&apos;t Love Me (I&apos;ll Kill Myself).m4a                         24447788 18 Can We Still Be Friends.m4a                                                     \r\n\r\nDon&apos;t leave for a road trip without bringing this collection.\r\n\r\n-Uncle Rick","last_updated":"2017-07-02T12:08:00.514Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:00a58c49f513619bc9f1c42fa34bdbbe36867f29","dn":"Dumb and Dumber Improved Soundtrack High Quality","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"00a58c49f513619bc9f1c42fa34bdbbe36867f29","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,165,140,73,245,19,97,155,201,241,196,47,163,75,219,190,54,134,127,41]},"name":"Dumb and Dumber Improved Soundtrack High Quality","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
