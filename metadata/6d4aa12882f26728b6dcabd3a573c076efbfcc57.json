Maybe still is. At thirty-one he has been both a brilliant failure and a dull success. He&apos;s made a lot of mistakes that have paid off and a lot of smart moves he&apos;ll regret forever (however long that turns out to be). Daniel Weir has gone from rags to riches and back, and managed to hold onto them both, though not much else.\r\n\r\nHis friends all seem to be dead, fed up with him or just disgusted - and who can blame them? And now Daniel Weir is all alone. As he contemplates his life, Daniel realises he only has two problems: The past and the future. He knows how bad the past has been. But the future - well, the future is something else.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-07-01T12:12:06.293Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d4aa12882f26728b6dcabd3a573c076efbfcc57","dn":"Espedair Street by Iain Banks EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"6d4aa12882f26728b6dcabd3a573c076efbfcc57","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,74,161,40,130,242,103,40,182,220,171,211,165,115,192,118,239,191,204,87]},"name":"Espedair Street by Iain Banks EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
