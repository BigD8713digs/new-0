Mahayana Buddhism also reveres the Tripitaka as authoritative but, unlike Theravadins, it also reveres various derivative literature and commentaries that were composed much later.[1][3]\r\n\r\nThe Tripitakas were composed between about 500 BCE to about the start of the common era, likely written down for the first time in the 1st century BCE.[3] The Dipavamsa states that during the reign of Valagamba of Anuradhapura (29&#x2013;17 BCE) the monks who had previously remembered the Tipitaka and its commentary orally now wrote them down in books, because of the threat posed by famine and war. The Mahavamsa also refers briefly to the writing down of the canon and the commentaries at this time. Each Buddhist sub-tradition had its own Tripitaka for its monasteries, written by its sangha, each set consisting of 32 books, in three parts or baskets of teachings: (1) the basket of expected discipline from monks (Vinaya Pi&#x1E6D;aka), (2) basket of discourse (S&#x16B;tra Pi&#x1E6D;aka, Nikayas), and (3) basket of special doctrine (Abhidharma Pi&#x1E6D;aka).[1][3][4] The structure, the code of conduct and moral virtues in the Vinaya basket particularly, have similarities to some of the surviving Dharmasutra texts of Hinduism.[5] Much of the surviving Tripitaka literature is in Pali, with some in Sanskrit as well as other local Asian languages.[4]\r\n <a href=\"\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripi%E1%B9%ADaka\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripi%E1%B9%ADaka</a>","last_updated":"2018-06-06T12:04:16.230Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:ecbcfa12bbf339121d748ea2be350edc936b8593","dn":"Tripiṭaka (Tipitaka) The Buddhist Scriptures 44 Books [Buddhism]","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"ecbcfa12bbf339121d748ea2be350edc936b8593","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,188,250,18,187,243,57,18,29,116,142,162,190,53,14,220,147,107,133,147]},"name":"Tripiṭaka (Tipitaka) The Buddhist Scriptures 44 Books [Buddhism]","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
