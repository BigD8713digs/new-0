Stripped of all things sacred, it has become the sanctuary of things profane. A loathsome presence inhabits it, gathering its vile power, reaching out...And next door Anjelica and Robert Marsten feel their lives undergoing a malevolent transformation.\r\nAnjelica is consumed by an aching, unnatural sexual hunger, creeping into her flesh...a malicious madness seizing her mind. An elderly neighbor succumbs to a bloody supernatural death, and two friends unwittingly unleash more terror. Then the skeptical cop protecting them receives a horrifying warning from his long-dead brother.\r\nAnd as the black shroud tightens, one man may offer the only hope: Merin Whitley,\r\nDemonologist; a man who has dedicated his life to the exorcism of supernatural evil...who has lost one skirmish with the Devil&apos;s offspring, who has fought to a stand-off once again...and will now undertake another desperate battle at the edge of ultimate darkness-on the very rim of Hell itself!","last_updated":"2017-10-20T12:07:04.824Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:510dc7d38cc82c79493e056d61f7ccfe568cf24e","dn":"Demon Shield Bruce King","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"510dc7d38cc82c79493e056d61f7ccfe568cf24e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,13,199,211,140,200,44,121,73,62,5,109,97,247,204,254,86,140,242,78]},"name":"Demon Shield Bruce King","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
