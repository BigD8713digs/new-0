Their latest is a half-hour mini-LP / EP, which elaborates on their improvisational skills, one of the trademarks of most krautrock giants (e.g., Can, Ash Ra Temple, Faust, Amon D&#xFC;&#xFC;l I and II). \r\nAs with many releases born of incessant jamming, the results are mixed. The minimalist, highly distorted sound of opener &#x2018;Backlash&#x2019; suggests they just started wailing away on their instruments, then started rolling tape to see what they could capture. It&#x2019;s brainfrying, to be sure, but it&#x2019;s also rather annoyingly fuzzy and dirty, sounding like someone forgot to clean the tape heads before recording. \r\nThankfully, &#x2018;Nobakitani&#x2019; restores both a modicum of sanity and a stellar, pastoral vibe &#x2013; a floating acoustic gem that&#x2019;s perfect for navel gazing or studying the inside of your eyelids. \r\nOverall, the band&#x2019;s playing is impeccable, and both ends of their sonic spectrum are explored to great effect. Therefore, whether you prefer the pummeling noise of lightning-fast guitar solos, or the laidback dreamy world of lying in a tall field of grass staring at overhead cloud formations, there&#x2019;s something here to tickle your fancy. \r\n\r\nTracklist: \r\n01 Backlash.flac \r\n02 Nobakitani.flac \r\n03 Trilobites.flac \r\n04 In a Coil.flac \r\n05 Floating Leaf.flac \r\n\r\nSummary: \r\nCountry: Japan \r\nGenre: post-rock, psychedelic rock","last_updated":"2018-06-15T12:18:23.177Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:de4b97ab3a2b647f64ca391f5a8327ae49b0f4a1","dn":"[post-rock, psychedelic rock] (2017) Kikagaku Moyo - Stone Garde","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"de4b97ab3a2b647f64ca391f5a8327ae49b0f4a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,75,151,171,58,43,100,127,100,202,57,31,90,131,39,174,73,176,244,161]},"name":"[post-rock, psychedelic rock] (2017) Kikagaku Moyo - Stone Garde","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
