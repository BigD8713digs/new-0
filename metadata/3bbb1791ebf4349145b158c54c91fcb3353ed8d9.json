Nicknamed Cowboy, he serves on a federal task force that has a single mission: to hunt down Dominic Abend, a European gangster.\r\n\r\nAfter a brutal murder gives them a lead, Zach feels like he&apos;s finally on Abend&apos;s trail. But things get complicated and very, very weird. Zach is beginning to suspect that Abend&apos;s evil goes beyond crime - perhaps to the edge of the supernatural.\r\n\r\nIn a centuries-old forest under a full moon, a beast assaults him, cursing him forever. In the aftermath Zach is transformed into something horrible - something deadly. Now the good cop has innocent blood on his hands. He has killed - and he will kill again - in the form of a beast that can&apos;t be controlled or stopped.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-03-22T14:44:50.547Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:3bbb1791ebf4349145b158c54c91fcb3353ed8d9","dn":"Werewolf Cop by Andrew Klavan EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"3bbb1791ebf4349145b158c54c91fcb3353ed8d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,187,23,145,235,244,52,145,69,177,88,197,76,145,252,179,53,62,216,217]},"name":"Werewolf Cop by Andrew Klavan EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
