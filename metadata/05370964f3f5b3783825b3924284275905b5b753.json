But Hawaii is paradise: they plant an orange tree in the yard; they share a bed once again and Nancy resolves to make a happy life for herself. She starts taking a yoga class and there she meets Ana, the charismatic teacher. Ana has short, black hair, a warm smile, and a hard-won wisdom that resonates deeply within Nancy. They are soon spending all their time together, sharing dinners, relaxing in Ana&#x2019;s hot tub, driving around Kona in the cute little car Ana helps Nancy buy. As Nancy grows closer and closer to Ana&#x2014;skipping family dinners and leaving the twins to their own devices she feels a happiness and understanding unlike anything she&#x2019;s ever experienced, and she knows that she will do anything Ana asks of her.
