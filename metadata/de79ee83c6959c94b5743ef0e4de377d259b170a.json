What does this similarity tell us about the mind, morality, and structure of the world itself? From the author of 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos comes a provocative hypothesis that explores the connection between what modern neuropsychology tells us about the brain and what rituals, myths, and religious stories have long narrated. A cutting-edge work that brings together neuropsychology, cognitive science, and Freudian and Jungian approaches to mythology and narrative, Maps of Meaning presents a rich theory that makes the wisdom and meaning of myth accessible to the critical modern mind.\r\n\r\nIncludes a PDF of Images from the book","last_updated":"2018-08-25T12:07:10.570Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:de79ee83c6959c94b5743ef0e4de377d259b170a","dn":"Maps of Meaning by Jordan B.
