Established in 2016, Behind the Shadow Drops combines Goto&#x2019;s disparate but commensurate interests in many different forms of music, most notably ambient, trip-hop, industrial minimalism, and modern classical. \r\nRecorded at Goto&#x2019;s home studio and mixed with esteemed producer and percussionist, John McEntire (Tortoise, The Sea and Cake, Yo La Tengo), H a r m o n i c merges Goto&#x2019;s dynamic, moody compositions with McEntire&#x2019;s renowned drum programming and percussive sensibilities. What begins as a passing resemblance to the more melancholy work of Goto&#x2019;s ensemble, MONO, slowly mutates into something otherworldly, submerging in a symphony of synths, drum machines, noise loops, and mournful strings (courtesy of Los Angeles experimental cellist, Helen Money). Resembling something like waves rippling in the ocean under a cloudy moonlit sky, H a r m o n i c is as eerie as it is beautiful &#x2013; a vast abyss punctuated by seemingly endless glimmers of light. \r\n\r\nTracklist: \r\n01- the end of daydreams.flac \r\n02- trace of snow waltz.flac \r\n03- utopia.flac \r\n04- positive shadow negative light.flac \r\n05- sonata.flac \r\n06- harmonic.flac \r\n07- ether.flac \r\n08- warm light.flac \r\n09- utopia_(reprise).flac \r\n\r\nSummary: \r\nCountry: Japan \r\nGenre: post-rock","last_updated":"2018-06-02T12:01:19.777Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b02234538b90ad9c5e543560c8cb4c283b4668d","dn":"[post-rock] (2017) Behind the Shadow Drops - H a r m o n i c [FL","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"8b02234538b90ad9c5e543560c8cb4c283b4668d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,2,35,69,56,185,10,217,197,229,67,86,12,140,180,194,131,180,102,141]},"name":"[post-rock] (2017) Behind the Shadow Drops - H a r m o n i c [FL","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
