In the 18th century, India&apos;s share of the world economy was as large as Europe&apos;s. By 1947, after two centuries of British rule, it had decreased sixfold. The empire blew rebels from cannon, massacred unarmed protesters, entrenched institutionalised racism and caused millions to die from starvation.  British imperialism justified itself as enlightened despotism for the benefit of the governed, but Shashi Tharoor demolishes this position, demonstrating how every supposed imperial &apos;gift&apos; - from the railways to the rule of law - was designed in Britain&apos;s interests alone. He goes on to show how Britain&apos;s Industrial Revolution was founded on India&apos;s deindustrialisation and the destruction of its textile industry.  In this bold and incisive reassessment of colonialism, Tharoor exposes to devastating effect the inglorious reality of Britain&apos;s stained Indian legacy. \r\n\r\n\r\nNarrator: Shashi Tharoor\r\nPublished: 2018\r\nCategory: History\r\nProvider: Penguin Books Ltd\r\nPresented by Audible.co.uk\r\n <a href=\"\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/gb/audiobook/inglorious-empire-what-the-british-did-to-india-unabridged/id1384949075\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/gb/audiobook/inglorious-empire-what-the-british-did-to-india-unabridged/id1384949075</a>","last_updated":"2018-05-22T12:13:25.330Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:2bc070af1761e1299d104a4a45b51b8b5e832a5f","dn":"Inglorious Empire: What the British Did to India- Shashi Tharoor","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"2bc070af1761e1299d104a4a45b51b8b5e832a5f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,192,112,175,23,97,225,41,157,16,74,74,69,181,27,139,94,131,42,95]},"name":"Inglorious Empire: What the British Did to India- Shashi Tharoor","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
