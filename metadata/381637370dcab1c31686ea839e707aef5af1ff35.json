Despite her cloistered life she had strong, often controversial views on sex, love and marriage too - a woman astonishing in her own age, whose book of apocalyptic visions, Scivias, would alone have been enough to ensure her lasting fame. \r\n\r\nIn this classic and highly praised biography - first published by Headline in 2001 - distinguished writer and journalist, Fiona Maddocks, draws on Hildegard&apos;s prolific writings to paint a portrait of her extraordinary life against the turbulent medieval background of crusade and schism, scientific discovery and cultural revolution. The great intellectual gifts and forceful character that emerge make her as fascinating as any figure in the Middle Ages.\r\n\r\nGenre: Non-Fiction &gt; Biographies &amp; Memoirs","last_updated":"2018-12-07T12:22:35.244Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:381637370dcab1c31686ea839e707aef5af1ff35","dn":"Hildegard of Bingen by Fiona Maddocks (.ePUB) ","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"381637370dcab1c31686ea839e707aef5af1ff35","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,22,55,55,13,202,177,195,22,134,234,131,158,112,122,239,90,241,255,53]},"name":"Hildegard of Bingen by Fiona Maddocks (.ePUB) ","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
