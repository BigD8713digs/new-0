A.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout This Game\r\n\r\nIn the world of Thasys, most races rely on Mana to survive. This magical energy is now growing scarce, and wars for survival are devastating the lands as magical beings fight over the last remaining scraps of this life-giving force. Somewhere, legendary creatures sleep an ageless slumber, hiding in their hearts the original Mana source. Only a few chosen ones can awaken these Creatures and guide them to save Thasys. They are the witnesses of a dying world, the last hope for the living.\r\n\r\nProdigy Tactics is a tactical turn-based game set in a fantastic world of Thasys, torn in a never ending war. Create a team of heroes, the last hope for the dying world, and lead them to the victory fighting hand in hand with powerful Guardians. Every character is equipped with a unique set of abilities to aid allies in the battle or to vanquish their foes.\r\n\r\nBattles in Prodigy Tactics consists of two teams facing each other on a classic arena. Each team can move freely on a 3x4 squares field, adjusting their tactic to the synergy of characters. While one side is preparing an attack, the other one sets the defense or counter-attack - making the game dynamic and engaging for both players at the time. Positioning becomes a key-component of the fights, as it can change the current target and affects the attack power.\r\n\r\n\r\nSystem Requirements\r\n\r\nMinimum:\r\nOS: Windows 7\r\nProcessor: Intel Core i5-4440 (or equivalent)\r\nMemory: 4 GB RAM\r\nGraphics: GeForce GTX 660, AMD Radeon HD 7850\r\nDirectX: Version 9.0c\r\nStorage: 4 GB available space\r\nRecommended:\r\nOS: Windows 10\r\nProcessor: Intel Core i5-4440 (or equivalent)\r\nGraphics: GeForce GTX 1060, AMD Radeon R9 Fury\r\nDirectX: Version 11\r\nStorage: 4 GB available space\r\n\r\nHow to install\r\n\r\nAfter download is done:\r\n- open Prodigy.Tactics.Early.Access.v20171109.Repack(executable file)\r\n- choose location ,\r\n- click install ,\r\n- wait until is done \r\n- play game from desktop shortcut \r\nor Run ...Prodigy.exe from the game install path","last_updated":"2017-11-19T12:12:18.537Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:407057020feb843849dbeb99e6007101f572216d","dn":"Prodigy.Tactics.Early.Access.v20171109.Repack","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"407057020feb843849dbeb99e6007101f572216d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,112,87,2,15,235,132,56,73,219,235,153,230,0,113,1,245,114,33,109]},"name":"Prodigy.Tactics.Early.Access.v20171109.Repack","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
