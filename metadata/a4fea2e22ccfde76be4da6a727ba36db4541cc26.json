Part I reviews the recent developments in analytical technology including sample pre-treatment and food additives. Part II covers the novel analysis of microbial and plant toxins including plant pyrrolizidine alkaloids. Part III focuses on marine toxins in fish and shellfish. Part IV discusses biogenic amines and common food toxicants, such as pesticides and heavy metals. Part V summarizes quality assurance and the recent developments in regulatory limits for toxins, toxicants and allergens, including discussions on laboratory accreditation and reference materials.\r\n\r\nVolume 1\r\nSection I: Recent Analytical Technology for Food Pathogens and Toxins 1\r\n1 Omic Analysis of Protein and Peptide Toxins in Food 3\r\n2 Biotechnology-Based Sensing Platforms for Detecting Foodborne Pathogens 37\r\n3 Review of Sample Treatments and the State-of-the-art of Analytical Techniques for Mycotoxins in Food 51\r\n4 Isothermal Nucleic Acid Ampli?cation for Food Toxicity Analyses 103\r\nSection II: Microbial and Plant Toxins 137\r\n5 Determination of Mycotoxins in Food 139\r\n6 Mycotoxins Detection in Asia 169\r\n7 Surface Plasmon Resonance Analysis of Food Toxins and Toxicants 195\r\n8 Food Poisoning Case Studies: Mushroom and Puffer?sh Toxin Investigation 217 \r\n9 The Analysis of Pyrrolizidine Alkaloids in Honey 237\r\n10 Pyrrolizidine Alkaloids in Food: Analytical, Toxicological and Health Considerations\r\n\r\nVolume 2\r\nSection III: Marine Toxins   319\r\n11 The Determination of Marine Biotoxins in Seafood 321\r\n12 Detection of Paralytic Shell?sh Poisoning Toxins in Molluscs 363\r\n13 Determination of Saxitoxin and Tetrodotoxin in Fish 403\r\n14 Determination of Saxitoxin, Tetrodotoxin and Common Phycotoxins 431\r\n15 Ciguatoxin Detection Methods and High-Throughput Assays 469\r\nSection IV: Biogenic Amines and Common Food Toxicants    489\r\n16 Detection of Histamine Based on Biosensor System 491\r\n17 Flow-based Technology for Analysis of Food Pesticides\r\n18 Residual Pesticides and Heavy Metals Analysis in Food 537\r\n19 Microarray Methodologies for Pesticides and Other Toxins in Foods 571\r\nSection V: Quality Assurance and Regulatory Development   593\r\n20 Accreditation, a Key Recognition for the Analysis of Food Toxins and Contaminants 595\r\n21 Quality Assurance and Control for Accurate Measurement of Food Toxins 621\r\n22 Analytical Methods and Development of Reference Materials for Toxic Metals and Metal Species in Food and Dietary Supplements 639\r\n23 Overview of Toxins and Toxicants in Food and Their Regulatory Limits\r\n24 Food Allergy: Managing Food Allergens 711\r\nIndex 743\r\n <a href=\"\nhttps://s1.postimg.org/77k92v0zj/Analysis_of_Food_Toxins_and_Toxicants_2_Volume.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://s1.postimg.org/77k92v0zj/Analysis_of_Food_Toxins_and_Toxicants_2_Volume.jpg</a>","last_updated":"2017-08-07T12:02:19.205Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4fea2e22ccfde76be4da6a727ba36db4541cc26","dn":"Analysis of Food Toxins and Toxicants (2 Volume Set)(gnv64)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"a4fea2e22ccfde76be4da6a727ba36db4541cc26","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,254,162,226,44,207,222,118,190,77,166,167,39,186,54,219,69,65,204,38]},"name":"Analysis of Food Toxins and Toxicants (2 Volume Set)(gnv64)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
