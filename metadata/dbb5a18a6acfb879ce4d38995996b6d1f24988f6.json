Skousen - Strategic Relocation: North American Guide to Safe Places (2011) pdf\r\n <a href=\"\nhttps://extraimage.net/images/2018/05/24/48cc61f15be2fee3c1394a21d7f804a8.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://extraimage.net/images/2018/05/24/48cc61f15be2fee3c1394a21d7f804a8.jpg</a>\r\n\r\nGenre: Survival, Preparedness\r\nPublisher: Joel Skousen Designs\r\nLanguage: English\r\nISBN-10: 1568612621\r\nISBN-13: 978-1568612621\r\nFormat: PDF\r\n\r\nThis is the long-awaited update of Mr. Skousen&apos;s classic book on relocation for security. Nearly 3/4 of this 3rd Edition is rewritten and it is expanded to 349 pages. In the process, the authors created all new graphics, charts and tables. There is also a new section on international retreat potential and 200 additional pages of analysis on every state and province of the US and Candada, complete with color maps.\r\n\r\nThe maps are chock full of detail, including private and public land use, satellite terrain features, military target areas, roads and graphic depictions of population density---one of our major threats to security in a crisis.\r\n\r\nDespite the ongoing illusions of peace and prosperity, our world is getting less stable, not more. The economic foundations of the US and the world are all based on fiat money and are crumbling. Earthquakes, Hurricanes, War and terrorism are ever present threats, and the secondary effects of social unrest in large metropolitan areas will be disruptive and dangerous if there is a shortage of essential commodities that cause people to panic.\r\n\r\nWhen you relocate or retire your prime concern should be long-term security, not recreation. Sometimes you can have both. This book is designed to help you relocate around serious threats and to develop contingency plans when you can&apos;t relocate due to work or family ties.\r\n\r\nStrategic Relocation is more than just pointing out safe areas--simply because the safer the area, the harder it is, generally, to make a living and have access to the conveniences of life. For these reasons, relocation decisions are fairly complex, and Mr. Skousen walks you through all of the difficult choices and compromises that are inevitable in finding safety, without being totally isolated. This book has answers for nearly every situation","last_updated":"2018-05-24T12:13:36.637Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:dbb5a18a6acfb879ce4d38995996b6d1f24988f6","dn":"Joel M.
