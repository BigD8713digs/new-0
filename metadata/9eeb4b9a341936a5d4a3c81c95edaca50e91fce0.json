Enjoy this ReSeed.\r\n\r\nThe Great Society was a 1960s San Francisco rock band that existed from 1965 to 1966, and was closely associated with the burgeoning Bay Area acid rock scene. Best known as the original group of model-turned-singer Grace Slick, the initial line-up of the band also featured her then-husband Jerry Slick on drums, his brother Darby Slick on guitar, David Miner on vocals and guitar, Bard DuPont on bass, and Peter van Gelder on flute, bass, and saxophone. Miner and DuPont would not remain with the band for the duration of its existence.\r\n\r\nGrace Slick, famously, went on to join Jefferson Airplane and the rest is, as they say, history.\r\n\r\nThis double album is a re-release of The Great Society&apos;s first two albums; &quot;Conspicuous Only in Its Absence&quot; and &quot;How It Was&quot;. They offer a glimpse into the early work of what would become one of the most influential, and in my opinion, beautiful voices to come out of the late 1960&apos;s music scene.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom CD, Flac, 44khz\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Great Society - Collector&apos;s Item\r\n\r\n 1.
