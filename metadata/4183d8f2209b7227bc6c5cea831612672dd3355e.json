Mallett EPUB\r\n\r\nThis is the dramatic and inspirational first-person story of theoretical physicist Dr. Ronald Mallett, who recently discovered the basic equations for a working time machine that he believes can be used as a transport vehicle to the past. Combining elements of Rocket Boys and Elegant Universe, Time Traveler follows Mallett&apos;s discovery of Einstein&apos;s work on space-time, his study of Godel&apos;s work on a solution of Einstein&apos;s equation that might allow for time travel, and his own research in theoretical physics spanning 30 years that culminated in his recent discovery of the effects of circulating laser light and its application to time travel.\r\n\r\nThe foundation for Mallett&apos;s historic time-travel work is Einstein&apos;s theory of general relativity, a sound platform for any physicist. Through his years of reading and studying Einstein, Mallett became a buff well before he had any notion of the importance of the grand old relativist&apos;s theories to his own career.\r\n\r\nOne interesting subtext to the story is Mallett&apos;s identification with, and keen interest in, Einstein. Mallett provides easy-to-understand explanations of the famous physicist&apos;s seminal work.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-01-05T12:01:15.739Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:4183d8f2209b7227bc6c5cea831612672dd3355e","dn":"Time Traveler by Ronald L.
