Masters of the Universe tells this fascinating story in an unusual format that blends factual and fictional elements. It is based on a series of interviews that a fictional person conducted with leading astronomers and physicists between 1913 and 1965. Among the interviewed scientists are giants such as Albert Einstein, Edwin Hubble, and George Gamow, but also scientists who are less well known today or not primarily known as cosmologists such as Karl Schwarzschild, Paul Dirac, and Svante Arrhenius. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n <a href=\"\nhttp://dlfeb.com/book/masters-of-universe-conversations-with-cosmologists-of-past/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttp://dlfeb.com/book/masters-of-universe-conversations-with-cosmologists-of-past/</a>","last_updated":"2017-07-23T12:01:16.639Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:f4a736c648ca5d99e79d96f55a56213dba8fd8fb","dn":"MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE: CONVERSATIONS WITH COSMOLOGISTS OF THE ","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"f4a736c648ca5d99e79d96f55a56213dba8fd8fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,167,54,198,72,202,93,153,231,157,150,245,90,86,33,61,186,143,216,251]},"name":"MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE: CONVERSATIONS WITH COSMOLOGISTS OF THE ","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
