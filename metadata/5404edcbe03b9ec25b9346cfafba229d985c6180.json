In this optimistic, solution-packed book, KJ asks: How can we change our family life so that it is full of the joy we&apos;d always hoped for? Drawing from the latest research and interviews with families, KJ discovers that it&apos;s possible to do more by doing less, and make our family life a refuge and pleasure, rather than another stress point in a hectic day.  \r\n\r\nShe focuses on nine common problem spots that cause parents the most grief, explores why they are hard, and offers small, doable, sometimes surprising steps you can take to make them better. Whether it&apos;s getting everyone out the door on time in the morning or making sure chores and homework get done without another battle, How to Be a Happier Parent shows that having a family isn&apos;t just about raising great kids and churning them out at destination: success. It&apos;s about experiencing joy - real joy, the kind you look back on, look forward to, and live for - along the way.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-09-02T12:02:53.565Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:5404edcbe03b9ec25b9346cfafba229d985c6180","dn":"How to be a Happier Parent by KJ Dell'Antonia EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"5404edcbe03b9ec25b9346cfafba229d985c6180","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,4,237,203,224,59,158,194,91,147,70,207,175,186,34,157,152,92,97,128]},"name":"How to be a Happier Parent by KJ Dell'Antonia EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
