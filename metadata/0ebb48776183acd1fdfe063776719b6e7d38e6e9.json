It won&#x2019;t stay open!&#x201D; \r\n\r\nStanding up slowly, Major Henry Boyd glanced up at the twisting nightmare in the sky. It looked like some hideous creature come to tear them to pieces. &#x201C;Keep trying,&#x201D; he told the Captain. \r\n\r\n&#x201C;Sir?&#x201D; Lieutenant Jessica McLeod ripped her gaze from the sky, voice shaking. &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve been thinking about why the gate won&#x2019;t activate. \r\n\r\nThe gravitational force of the&#x2014;&#x201D; She stammered over the word. &#x201C;Of the black hole would create a massive time distortion effect.&#x201D; \r\n\r\nHe stalked toward her, frowning. &#x201C;A what?&#x201D; \r\n\r\n&#x201C;Time here will be moving much slower than back on Earth, sir.

He swallowed hard. &#x201C;I won&#x2019;t accept that, Lieutenant.&#x201D; Lucy, barely old enough to understand. Heather, having to explain why he was never coming home again. &#x201C;They&#x2019;ll find a way to come get us.
