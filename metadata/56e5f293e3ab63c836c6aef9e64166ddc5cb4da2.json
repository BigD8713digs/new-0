Can the CEO&apos;s appearance tell you anything about a company&apos;s quarterly earnings? In The Tell, psychologist Matthew Hertenstein reveals that our intuition is surprisingly good at using small clues to make big predictions, and shows how we can make better decisions by homing in on the right details. Drawing on rigorous research in psychology and brain science, Hertenstein explains how to hone our powers of observation to increase our predictive capacities. By training ourselves to read facial and bodily cues, we can accurately predict everything from divorce rates to sexual preferences, election results to the likelihood of corporate success. A charming testament to the power of the human mind, The Tell will, to paraphrase Sherlock Holmes, show us how to notice what we see.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-08-06T12:00:15.299Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:56e5f293e3ab63c836c6aef9e64166ddc5cb4da2","dn":"The Tell_ The Little Clues That Reveal Big Truths about Who We A","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"56e5f293e3ab63c836c6aef9e64166ddc5cb4da2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,229,242,147,227,171,99,200,54,198,174,249,230,65,102,221,197,203,77,162]},"name":"The Tell_ The Little Clues That Reveal Big Truths about Who We A","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
