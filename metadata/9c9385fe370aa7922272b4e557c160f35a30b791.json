Once-bright skies are now dark. Planes have plummeted to the ground. The systems of modern life have crumbled. With their stocked larders and stores of supplies, the Amish are unaffected at first. But as the English (the Amish name for all non-Amish people) become more and more desperate, they begin to invade Amish farms, taking whatever they want and unleashing unthinkable violence on the peaceable community.\r\n\r\nSeen through the diary of an Amish farmer named Jacob as he tries to protect his family and his way of life, When the English Fall examines the idea of peace in the face of deadly chaos: Should members of a nonviolent society defy their beliefs and take up arms to defend themselves? And if they don&#x2019;t, can they survive?\r\n\r\nDavid Williams&#x2019;s debut novel is a thoroughly engrossing look into the closed world of the Amish, as well as a thought-provoking examination of &#x201C;civilization&#x201D; and what remains if the center cannot hold","last_updated":"2017-08-04T12:02:16.410Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c9385fe370aa7922272b4e557c160f35a30b791","dn":"When the English Fall ~ David Williams [Shades]epub","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"9c9385fe370aa7922272b4e557c160f35a30b791","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,147,133,254,55,10,167,146,34,114,180,229,87,193,96,243,90,48,183,145]},"name":"When the English Fall ~ David Williams [Shades]epub","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
