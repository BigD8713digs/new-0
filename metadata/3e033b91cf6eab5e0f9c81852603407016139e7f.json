Hill writes that he was inspired by a suggestion from business magnate and later-philanthropist Andrew Carnegie. While the book&apos;s title and much of the text concerns increased income, the author insists that the philosophy taught in the book can help people succeed in any line of work, to do and be anything they can imagine. First published during the Great Depression, at the time of Hill&apos;s death in 1970, Think and Grow Rich had sold more than 20 million copies, and by 2015 over 100 million copies had been sold worldwide. It remains the biggest seller of Napoleon Hill&apos;s books. \r\n\r\n-- Also --\r\n\r\nDo you like oldies? Check out MaxiMusic!
