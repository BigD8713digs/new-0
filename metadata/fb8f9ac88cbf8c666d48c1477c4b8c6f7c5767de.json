Be careful, though-- this also includes many installers in the Windows and system folders which your computer may need. Don&apos;t wipe anything unless you&apos;re 100% sure it&apos;s unnecessary. \r\nA &quot;Search for Archives&quot; tab finds and displays large zips and other archives which might be wasting drive space. \r\nA &quot;Disk Analyzer&quot; find and displays large files of all types across your system. You can right-click to delete items you&apos;re sure you don&apos;t need, or open their folder in Explorer for further checks. \r\n\r\n\r\nHow to Install: \r\n1). Instructions are included in ReadMe.txt if needed. \r\n2). Thats all, Done &amp; enjoy","last_updated":"2017-05-25T11:58:10.361Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb8f9ac88cbf8c666d48c1477c4b8c6f7c5767de","dn":"Black Bird Cleaner 1.0.2.1   Key - CrackingPatching","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"fb8f9ac88cbf8c666d48c1477c4b8c6f7c5767de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,143,154,200,140,191,140,102,109,72,193,71,124,75,140,111,124,87,103,222]},"name":"Black Bird Cleaner 1.0.2.1   Key - CrackingPatching","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
