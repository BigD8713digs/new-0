George Patton took command and reinvigorated U.S. troops with tough training and new tactics. In late March, at El Guettar in Tunisia, Patton&#x2019;s men defeated the Germans. It was a morale-boosting victory &#x2014; the first American success versus the Germans and the first of Patton&#x2019;s storied World War II career &#x2014; and proved to the enemy, the British, and the Americans themselves that the U.S. Army could fight and win.\r\n\r\nPrint Length: 312 pages\r\nPublisher: Stackpole Books (October 20, 2017)","last_updated":"2018-01-01T12:04:44.732Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:e1491125cf64e84b3801be5771702017e1d277b7","dn":"Patton's First Victory: How General George Patton Turned the...","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"e1491125cf64e84b3801be5771702017e1d277b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,73,17,37,207,100,232,75,56,1,190,87,113,112,32,23,225,210,119,183]},"name":"Patton's First Victory: How General George Patton Turned the...","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
