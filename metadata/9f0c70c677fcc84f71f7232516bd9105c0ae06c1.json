Whereas other torrents have each episode separate, I have merged all episodes of each serial into a single mp4 file.  I have prioritized smaller size over higher quality, though some files are still very large.  I used freeware AVC (Any Video Converter) to merge these files.\r\n\r\nSome Dr Who episodes were lost by the BBC.  They have provided reconstructed episodes from stage pictures.  I have created split-screen versions, using these stage pictures combined with fan-created animations.  I used freeware VSDC to create these versions","last_updated":"2018-05-20T12:12:33.096Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f0c70c677fcc84f71f7232516bd9105c0ae06c1","dn":"Doctor Who Original Complete (1963-1989)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"9f0c70c677fcc84f71f7232516bd9105c0ae06c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,12,112,198,119,252,200,79,113,247,35,37,22,189,145,5,192,174,6,193]},"name":"Doctor Who Original Complete (1963-1989)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
