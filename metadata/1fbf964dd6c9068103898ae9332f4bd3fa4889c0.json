It&apos;s about the joys and tribulations (mostly the tribulations) of winning the lottery&#x97;the galactic lottery&#x97;accidentally. And wrongly. Tom Carmody is awarded a remarkable prize, is taken half way across the universe to collect it, finds himself hopelessly lost, and needs to find his way home again to Earth&#x2026;to this Earth, not an alternate, weirdo Earth. He&apos;s got to get back. And the price is high.\r\n\r\nIn its style of humor&#x97;and even in some of the jokes&#x97;Dimension of Miracles is very obviously a precursor of Douglas Adams&apos; Hitchhiker&apos;s Guide to the Galaxy. Douglas actually hadn&apos;t read Dimension of Miracles until very shortly after Hitchhiker came out, when people pointed him to it, and he told me that he found the experience almost shocking&#x97;it was like reading himself. He was a huge admirer of Bob Sheckley and a huge admirer of this book, and in later life, I had the privilege of introducing both of them.&quot;\r\n\r\nDimension of Miracles is a satirical science fiction novel first published by Dell in 1968. It&apos;s about Tom Carmody, a New Yorker who, thanks to a computer error, wins the main prize in the Intergalactic Sweepstakes. Tom claims his prize before the error is discovered and is allowed to keep it. However, since Tom is a human from Earth without galactic status and no space traveling experience, he has no homing instinct that can guide him back to Earth once his odyssey begins - and the galactic lottery organizers cannot transport him home. Meanwhile, his removal from Earth has caused a predatory entity to spring into existence - one that pursues and aims to destroy him. Carmody is on the run, and he ends up transporting from Earth to Earth - different phases and realities of the planet, which of course is not the time or condition he expects.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-12-25T12:07:24.809Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:1fbf964dd6c9068103898ae9332f4bd3fa4889c0","dn":"Dimension of Miracles by Robert Sheckley EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"1fbf964dd6c9068103898ae9332f4bd3fa4889c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,191,150,77,214,201,6,129,3,137,138,233,51,47,75,211,250,72,137,192]},"name":"Dimension of Miracles by Robert Sheckley EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
