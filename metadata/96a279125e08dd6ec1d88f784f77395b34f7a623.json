She celebrates the clownish grandiosity and the poetry of Norman Mailer&#x2019;s long career and maps the sociosexual cataclysm embodied by porn star Linda Lovelace.  And in the deceptively titled &quot;Lost Cat,&quot; she explores how the most intimate relationships may be warped by power and race. \r\n\r\nWitty, wide-ranging, tender, and beautiful, Somebody with a Little Hammer displays the same heat-seeking, revelatory understanding for which Gaitskill&#x2019;s writing has always been known.\r\n\r\nPrint Length: 289 pages\r\nPublisher: Pantheon (April 4, 2017)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       <a href=\"\nhttps://pirates-forum.org/Forum-Requests\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://pirates-forum.org/Forum-Requests</a>","last_updated":"2018-01-01T12:05:54.321Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:96a279125e08dd6ec1d88f784f77395b34f7a623","dn":"Mary Gaitskill - Somebody with a Little Hammer: Essays","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"96a279125e08dd6ec1d88f784f77395b34f7a623","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,162,121,18,94,8,221,110,193,216,143,120,79,119,57,91,52,247,166,35]},"name":"Mary Gaitskill - Somebody with a Little Hammer: Essays","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
