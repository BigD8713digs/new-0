Drawing on his memories of the real inhabitants of Monterey, California, Steinbeck interweaves the stories of Doc, Henri, Mack and his boys, and the other characters in this world, where only the fittest survive, to create a novel that is at once one of his most humorous and most poignant works.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-12-11T12:01:04.507Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b951a7c7470bc717eeb251d74f2fbca6770eaa0","dn":"Cannery Row by John Steinbeck EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"8b951a7c7470bc717eeb251d74f2fbca6770eaa0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,149,26,124,116,112,188,113,126,235,37,29,116,242,251,202,103,112,234,160]},"name":"Cannery Row by John Steinbeck EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
