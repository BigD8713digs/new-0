Remy once lived, the discovery sends shock waves through the Savannah Police Department. All of the bodies were hidden before Remy&apos;s imprisonment and subsequent death thirty-six years earlier-except for one belonging to a missing child.\r\n\r\nHomicide partners Elise Sandburg and David Gould were the Savannah PD&apos;s dream team, solving uncrackable crimes and catching killers. But their last case resulted in their termination from the squad, until the coroner calls them back to consult, unofficially, on a body found in the wall of a house once occupied by Remy, a killer Elise&apos;s own father sent to jail-a killer who died in prison. The MO seems uncomfortably similar to that of a serial killer wreaking havoc in Florida.\r\n\r\nDoes Elise have a copycat on her hands? Is Remy&apos;s influence reaching from beyond the grave? Or is Elise making connections where there are none? When her father warns her to back off the case, Elise&apos;s shadowy family history threatens to swallow her once again. But whatever force is at work, she won&apos;t rest until the killing stops.\r\n\r\nNow at odds with everyone she cares about and forced to acknowledge her worsening emotional state, Elise struggles to protect the people she loves as the body count rises","last_updated":"2017-08-14T12:01:12.255Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:e871345bc4c6b36ebad8e97c969d80511ce33bdc","dn":"Truly Dead Anne Frasier Elise Sandburg Series Book 4(2017) - EPU","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"e871345bc4c6b36ebad8e97c969d80511ce33bdc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,113,52,91,196,198,179,110,186,216,233,124,150,157,128,81,28,227,59,220]},"name":"Truly Dead Anne Frasier Elise Sandburg Series Book 4(2017) - EPU","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
