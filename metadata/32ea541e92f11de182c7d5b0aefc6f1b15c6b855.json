Among the software applications of this kind you can find VideoPad Video Editor. The interface of this utility is divided into several parts (e.g. Media List, Effects, Transitions, Files, Clips, Video Track, Audio Track, Overlay Track), which may make everything seem a little hard to operate. You can capture video from a camcorder or another device like a webcam or a TV capture card, and once you have added files and sequence clips to the queue, you can start editing them. \r\n\r\n\r\nFEATURES - \r\nSo, you can select position for the new clip (at slider&apos;s position, to the timeline&apos;s start or end point), add blank slides and overlays, modify media in an external editor, change playback speed and stabilize video with the Deshaker filter. \r\nYou can also create bookmarks and subtitles, import and export subtitles, select Chrome Key color, save video in the &quot;Stereoscopic 3D&quot; output format, apply audio effects (e.g. amplify, chorus, compressor, distortion, flanger, reverb), as well as record a narration. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, you can apply various video effects (e.g. brightness, crop, edge detection, sepia, temperature, posterize, hue) and transitions (e.g. cross fade, reveal, split, fan, circle, diamond). \r\nThe program comes with a well-drawn help file and video tutorials while the system resource usage is moderate. It may lag sometimes between commands, but overall, VideoPad Video Editor manages to put up a good performance","last_updated":"2017-08-24T12:01:11.110Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:32ea541e92f11de182c7d5b0aefc6f1b15c6b855","dn":"NCH VideoPad Video Editor Professional 5.11 Beta   Patch ","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"32ea541e92f11de182c7d5b0aefc6f1b15c6b855","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,234,84,30,146,241,29,225,130,199,213,176,174,252,111,27,21,198,184,85]},"name":"NCH VideoPad Video Editor Professional 5.11 Beta   Patch ","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
