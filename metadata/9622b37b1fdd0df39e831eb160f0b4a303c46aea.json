But Joe wasn&apos;t everything that Lindsay thought he was, and she&apos;s still reeling from his betrayal as a wave of mysterious, and possibly unnatural, heart attacks claims seemingly unrelated victims across San Francisco. As if that weren&apos;t enough, the bomber she and Joe captured is about to go on trial, and his defense raises damning questions about Lindsay and Joe&apos;s investigation. Not knowing whom to trust, and struggling to accept the truth about the man she thought she knew, Lindsay must connect the dots of a deadly conspiracy before a brilliant criminal puts her on trial.\r\n[IMG]https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1468347205p5/3780.jpg[/IMG]\r\nJames Patterson has created more enduring fictional characters than any other novelist writing today with his Alex Cross, Michael Bennett, Women&#x2019;s Murder Club, Private, NYPD Red, Daniel X, Maximum Ride, and Middle School series.
