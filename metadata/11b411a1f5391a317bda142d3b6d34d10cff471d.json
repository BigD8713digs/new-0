After its founding in 509 BCE, the Romans refused to allow a single leader to seize control of the state and grab absolute power. The Roman commitment to cooperative government and peaceful transfers of power was unmatched in the history of the ancient world.\r\n\r\nBut by the year 133 BCE, the republican system was unable to cope with the vast empire Rome now ruled. Almost as soon as they had conquered the Mediterranean, Rome became engulfed in violent political conflicts and civil wars that would destroy the Republic less than a century later.\r\n\r\nChronicling the years 133-80 BCE, The Storm Before the Storm is a rollicking deep dive into the bloody battles, political machinations, and human drama that defined a dangerous new political environment - a stark warning for modern readers about what happens to a civilization driven by increasing economic inequality, political polarization, and ruthless ambition.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-10-26T12:00:39.747Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:11b411a1f5391a317bda142d3b6d34d10cff471d","dn":"The Storm Before the Storm by Mike Duncan EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"11b411a1f5391a317bda142d3b6d34d10cff471d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,180,17,161,245,57,26,49,123,218,20,45,59,109,52,209,12,255,71,29]},"name":"The Storm Before the Storm by Mike Duncan EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
