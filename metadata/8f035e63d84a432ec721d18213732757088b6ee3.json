In Chain, malls, theme parks, hotels and corporate centers worldwide are joined into one monolithic contemporary &quot;superlandscape&quot; that shapes the lives of two women caught within it. One is a corporate businesswoman set adrift by her corporation while she researches the international theme park industry. The other is a young drifter, living and working illegally on the fringes of a shopping mall. Cohen contrives to turn the entire planet into a stretch of New Jersey commercial property--a universe that feels entirely real yet has the distinct smack of J.G. Ballard otherness.\r\n\r\n&quot;Jem Cohen&apos;s Chain is a hypnotic, highly original piece about what it&apos;s like to live in the new global corporate landscape.&quot;\r\n\r\n--Daily Telegraph\r\n\r\n&quot;Dreamlike... transforms a mundane world into something strange and new... formidable power... fierce political intelligence.&quot;\r\n\r\n---Village Voice","last_updated":"2018-09-22T12:05:24.738Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f035e63d84a432ec721d18213732757088b6ee3","dn":"Chain, a film of Jem Cohen (2004).mp4","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"8f035e63d84a432ec721d18213732757088b6ee3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,3,94,99,216,74,67,46,199,33,209,130,19,115,39,87,8,139,110,227]},"name":"Chain, a film of Jem Cohen (2004).mp4","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
