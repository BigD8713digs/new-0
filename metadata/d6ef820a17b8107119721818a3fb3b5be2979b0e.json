And with the swooning melodies, slightly jittery riffs, handclap-infused breakdown and wurlitzer sounds of opener Harvey, they pull the listener straight into their debut album&#x2019;s realm, one that&#x2019;s filled with vintage charm and off-kilter edges. \r\nThe hazy guitars and breezy melodies often wouldn&#x2019;t be out of place in a 90s rom-com, the sweet nature, surf aesthetics and often slick production values being offset by an occasional twinkling synth or, as on Blue Lips, the feel of a doo-wop classic morphed with the essence of a certain other Liverpudlian band. But the real strength of Invitation to Her&#x2019;s lies in showcasing one of the duo&#x2019;s best assets: their ability to effortlessly piece together a killer hook. Almost every track here is loaded with a chorus that swoons or soars, burying and sticking in the mind. \r\nBy its closing tracks though, the relative lack of shade to balance the bubblegum-coloured light can become a bit cloying, the endearing charm of the sugary nature fading slightly. Nevertheless, Laading and Fitzpatrick have still delivered a debut that suggests they&#x2019;ll be continuing to craft impossibly catchy off-kilter pop for years to come. \r\n\r\nTracklist: \r\n01.
