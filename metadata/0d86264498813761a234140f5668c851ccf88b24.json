The element of surprise and desire to fuse disparate sounds was felt throughout their sophomore record, 2014&#x2019;s well-received Shiny Eyed Babies. It shines through even brighter on follow-up album Say So, released through new label home Cuneiform. \r\nA press release dubs the forthcoming LP a &#x201C;thrilling, aural roller-coaster ride with arrangements designed to make listeners throw their arms up in wild abandon.&#x201D; Surveying Say So&#x2019;s heady yet meta subject matter, it&#x2019;s easy to see how such a varied sort of record could come about. \r\nAlong with &#x201C;the emergence of personal demons, &#x201D; the new full-length sees Bent Knee digging into the abstract, specifically &#x201C;looking at the bigger picture and figuring out where we as individuals stand, and how we carve out meaning in this giant universe,&#x201D; according to violinist Chris Baum. \r\nWhile complex, contrasting compositions might be in Bent Knee&#x2019;s DNA, much of the &#x201C;surprise&#x201D; in Say So can likely also be attributed to the unconventional space in which it was recorded. &#x201C;A friend of ours pointed us to an empty, unlocked, million-square foot industrial complex in Boston,&#x201D; says frontwoman/keyboardist Courtney Swain. &#x201C;It felt like zombies were going to jump out anytime. It was a foreboding locale and gave the session a distinctly dark vibe.&#x201D; \r\n\r\nTracklist: \r\n01 Black Tar Water.flac \r\n02 Leak Water.flac \r\n03 Counselor.flac \r\n04 EVE.flac \r\n05 Interlude.flac \r\n06 The Things You Love.flac \r\n07 Nakami.flac \r\n08 Commercial.flac \r\n09 Hands Up.flac \r\n10 Good Girl.flac \r\n\r\nSummary: \r\nCountry: USA \r\nGenre: art rock, post-rock","last_updated":"2018-07-09T12:00:59.494Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d86264498813761a234140f5668c851ccf88b24","dn":"[art rock, post-rock] (2016) Bent Knee - Say So [FLAC,Tracks] {1","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"0d86264498813761a234140f5668c851ccf88b24","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,134,38,68,152,129,55,97,162,52,20,15,86,104,200,81,204,248,139,36]},"name":"[art rock, post-rock] (2016) Bent Knee - Say So [FLAC,Tracks] {1","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
