Produced for CBS, the series premiered as part of the network&apos;s Saturday morning schedule on September 13, 1969, and aired for two seasons until October 31, 1970. In 1978, a selection of episodes from the later series Scooby&apos;s All-Stars and The Scooby-Doo Show were aired on ABC under the Scooby-Doo, Where Are You! name and, as such, is sometimes marketed as its third season. \r\n\r\nThe series centers on a group of characters consisting of four teenagers&#x2014;Fred Jones, Daphne Blake, Velma Dinkley, and Norville &quot;Shaggy&quot; Rogers&#x2014;and the title character a semi-anthropomorphic Great Dane named Scooby-Doo. The group travel in a van named the Mystery Machine, solving mysteries involving several local legends; in doing so, they discover that the perpetrator is almost invariably a disguised person who seeks to exploit the legend for personal gain. \r\n\r\nScooby-Doo, Where Are You! was the first incarnation of what would eventually become a long-running media franchise, which primarily consists of subsequent animated series, several films, and related merchandise. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndownload it \r\n\r\ndirectly burn to disc \r\n\r\nuse any software like nero to burn the files to a dvd \r\n\r\n\r\nplease seed after download","last_updated":"2018-03-19T12:04:07.218Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:5497eb3396dc61c78d5071f8ca1dd84672358ee0","dn":"scooby doo","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"5497eb3396dc61c78d5071f8ca1dd84672358ee0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,151,235,51,150,220,97,199,141,80,113,248,202,29,216,70,114,53,142,224]},"name":"scooby doo","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
