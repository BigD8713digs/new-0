In addition, CS: GO will introduce new gameplay modes, matchmaking, leader boards, and more.\r\n\r\n&#x201C;Counter-Strike took the gaming industry by surprise when the unlikely MOD became the most played online PC action game in the world almost immediately after its release in August 1999,&#x201D; said Doug Lombardi at Valve. &#x201C;For the past 12 years, it has continued to be one of the most-played games in the world, headline competitive gaming tournaments and selling over 25 million units worldwide across the franchise. CS: GO promises to expand on CS&#x2019; award-winning gameplay and deliver it to gamers on the PC as well as the next gen consoles and the Mac.&#x201D;\r\n\r\n\r\nFEATURES\r\n\r\n&#x2013; 100% clean rip from Steam game content\r\n&#x2013; Include build-in auto updater\r\n&#x2013; Working game inventory and items\r\n&#x2013; Working server browser with Internet, Favourite and LAN tabs\r\n&#x2013; Working offline mode with bots\r\n&#x2013; Playable on Internet and LAN\r\n&#x2013; Compatible with Windows 10/8/7/Vista/XP SP3\r\n\r\nSYSTEM REQUIREMENTS\r\n MINIMUM:\r\nOS: Windows&#xAE; 7/Vista/XP\r\nProcessor: Intel&#xAE; Core&#x2122; 2 Duo E6600 or AMD Phenom&#x2122; X3 8750 processor or better\r\nMemory: 2 GB RAM\r\nGraphics: Video card must be 256 MB or more and should be a DirectX 9-compatible with support for Pixel Shader 3.0\r\nDirectX: Version 9.0c\r\nStorage: 15 GB available space","last_updated":"2017-07-29T12:02:33.264Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:f478669bd07feca2c469c12beb723255ab5d0d94","dn":"Counter-Strike Global Offensive","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"f478669bd07feca2c469c12beb723255ab5d0d94","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,120,102,155,208,127,236,162,196,105,193,43,235,114,50,85,171,93,13,148]},"name":"Counter-Strike Global Offensive","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
