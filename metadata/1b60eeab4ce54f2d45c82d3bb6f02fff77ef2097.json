The comprehensive descriptions and explanations for each item illuminate what to do, what not to do, and why.\r\n\r\nThe third edition covers language and library features added in Java 7, 8, and 9, including the functional programming constructs that were added to its object-oriented roots. Many new items have been added, including a chapter devoted to lambdas and streams.\r\n\r\nNew coverage includes\r\nFunctional interfaces, lambda expressions, method references, and streams\r\nDefault and static methods in interfaces\r\nType inference, including the diamond operator for generic types\r\nThe @SafeVarargs annotation\r\nThe try-with-resources statement\r\nNew library features such as the Optional interface, java.time, and the convenience factory methods for collections\r\nRegister your product at informit.com/register for convenient access to the web edition eBook, updates, and/or corrections as they become available","last_updated":"2017-12-29T12:00:30.740Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b60eeab4ce54f2d45c82d3bb6f02fff77ef2097","dn":"Effective Java(2017) - PDF - zeke23","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"1b60eeab4ce54f2d45c82d3bb6f02fff77ef2097","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,96,238,171,76,229,79,45,69,200,45,59,182,240,47,255,119,239,32,151]},"name":"Effective Java(2017) - PDF - zeke23","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
