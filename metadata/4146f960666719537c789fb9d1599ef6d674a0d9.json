She learns how to thread a needle, cut patterns, and sew a fine seam by hand. With the help of Miss Patch, and the book&apos;s many diagrams and amusing drawings, beginning sewists can learn to make a pillow, a bag, a patchwork quilt, an apron, and even simple clothes. Originally published in 1969, this is a timeless introduction to the pleasures of sewing.\r\n\r\nGenre: Non-Fiction &gt; Children&apos;s Books","last_updated":"2018-09-22T12:18:42.928Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:4146f960666719537c789fb9d1599ef6d674a0d9","dn":"Miss Patch's Learn-to-Sew Book by Carolyn Meyer (.epub)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"4146f960666719537c789fb9d1599ef6d674a0d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,70,249,96,102,103,25,83,124,120,159,185,209,89,158,246,214,116,160,217]},"name":"Miss Patch's Learn-to-Sew Book by Carolyn Meyer (.epub)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
