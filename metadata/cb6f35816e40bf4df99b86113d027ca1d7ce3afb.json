That&#x2019;s why the Collectors are always keeping watch.\r\n\r\nThe Collectors sweeps readers into a hidden world where wishes are stolen and dreams have a price. Fast-paced, witty, and riveting, this contemporary fantasy adventure has magic woven through every moment.\r\n\r\nIt&apos;s the first book in a two-book series from Jacqueline West, the New York Times best-selling author of the Books of Elsewhere series. For fans of Serafina and the Black Cloak, The Isle of the Lost, and The Secret Keepers.\r\n\r\nVan has always been an outsider. Most people don&#x2019;t notice him. But he notices them. And he notices the small trinkets they drop, or lose, or throw away - that&#x2019;s why his collection is full of treasures. Then one day, Van notices a girl stealing pennies from a fountain, and everything changes. He follows the girl, Pebble, and uncovers an underground world full of wishes and the people who collect them. Apparently, not all wishes are good, and even good wishes often have unintended consequences - and the Collectors have made it their duty to protect us. \r\n\r\nBut they aren&apos;t the only ones who have their eyes on the world&#x2019;s wishes - and they may not be the good guys, after all.  \r\n\r\nJacqueline West, author of the New York Times best-selling Books of Elsewhere series, draws readers into a story about friendship, magic, and the gray area between good and evil. The Collectors is for fans of Cassie Beasley&#x2019;s Circus Mirandus and Jonathan Auxier&#x2019;s The Night Gardener.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-10-14T12:02:31.736Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb6f35816e40bf4df99b86113d027ca1d7ce3afb","dn":"The Collectors by Jacqueline West EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"cb6f35816e40bf4df99b86113d027ca1d7ce3afb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,111,53,129,110,64,191,77,249,155,134,17,61,2,124,161,215,206,58,251]},"name":"The Collectors by Jacqueline West EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
