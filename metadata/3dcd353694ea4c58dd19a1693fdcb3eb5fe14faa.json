Note that the program is able to change day and night, the clouds will also change in accordance with the current weather conditions over this or that part of the earth, you can see the lights of cities.\r\nEarthView has two modes of operation, I already wrote about it above. If you decide to create a splash screen, you can view highly detailed views of the earth, globe or map, it all depends on the settings you set. If you believe the developers, the resulting images will be of excellent quality, high resolution, the colors will be saturated, that&apos;s what sets the development apart from others, which by the way is not so much, I can not even remember if I met analogues or not. All the parameters that are responsible for the generation of the picture can be set by you in detail, although everything is in English, but I think a little effort and you will be able to fully understand all the available chips, because it&apos;s important to adjust the image quality to a specific computer. If you do not have enough pictures offered in the EarthView standard, then you can download additional maps from the official site, I also think you can figure it out yourself.\r\n50Translating...Suggest an editView original translationContinue improving translation qualityThank you!Your contribution will be used to improve translation quality and may be shown to users anonymouslyContributeClose\r\n\r\nDeveloper: DeskSoft\r\nLicense: ShareWare\r\nLanguage: English\r\nThe size: 72.06 MB\r\nOS: Windows\r\n\r\n[b]How to Install:[/b]\r\n1).
