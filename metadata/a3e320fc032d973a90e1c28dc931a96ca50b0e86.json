Twisty, tense, impossible to turn off psychological suspense for fans of I Let You Go and The Widow.\r\n\r\nIt starts with a lie. The kind we&apos;ve all told - to a former acquaintance we can&apos;t quite place but still, for some reason, feel the need to impress. The story of our life, embellished for the benefit of the happily married lawyer with the kids and the lovely home.\r\n\r\nAnd the next thing you know, you&apos;re having dinner at their house and accepting an invitation to join them on holiday - swept up in their perfect life, the kind you always dreamed of....\r\n\r\nWhich turns out to be less than perfect. But by the time you&apos;re trapped and sweating in the relentless Greek sun, burning to escape the tension all around you - by the time you start to realise that however painful the truth might be, it&apos;s the lies that cause the real damage - well, by then it could just be too late.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-12-09T12:08:44.103Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:a3e320fc032d973a90e1c28dc931a96ca50b0e86","dn":"Lie with Me by Sabine Durrant EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"a3e320fc032d973a90e1c28dc931a96ca50b0e86","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,227,32,252,3,45,151,58,144,225,194,141,201,49,169,108,165,11,14,134]},"name":"Lie with Me by Sabine Durrant EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
