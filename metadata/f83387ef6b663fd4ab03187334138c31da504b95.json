Even in an age of cloning and artificial biology, the remarkable truth remains: Nobody has ever made anything living entirely out of dead material. Life remains the only way to make life. Are we still missing a vital ingredient in its creation? Jim Al-Khalili and Johnjoe Macfadden reveal the hitherto missing ingredient to be quantum mechanics and the strange phenomena that lie at the heart of this most mysterious of sciences. As they brilliantly demonstrate here, life lives on the quantum edge.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-05-17T12:02:27.122Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:f83387ef6b663fd4ab03187334138c31da504b95","dn":"Life on the Edge by Johnjoe McFadden, Jim Al-Khalili EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"f83387ef6b663fd4ab03187334138c31da504b95","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,51,135,239,107,102,63,212,171,3,24,115,52,19,140,49,218,80,75,149]},"name":"Life on the Edge by Johnjoe McFadden, Jim Al-Khalili EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
