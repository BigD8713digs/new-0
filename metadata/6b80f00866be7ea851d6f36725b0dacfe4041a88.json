The deeply religious lead song &quot;Come to Jesus,&quot; blends Southern twangs with electric riffs straight out of the east coast boroughs. Besides having a voice with a hint of Joan Osbourne, and uniquely resembling Suzanne Vega, Smith also has a set of pipes that rock without restriction as she sings, &quot;Worry not my daughters, worry not my sons. Child when life don&apos;t seem worth living. Come to Jesus and let him hold you in his arms,&quot; and then soothes listeners into a calm after the storm with &quot;Falling.&quot; Smith has a folk-rock sensibility that matches her celtic melodies with an outlook inspired by faith. And she uses her outlook to ripen her songs with an emotional elegance. By the time you&apos;re listening to the last note of the closing title song, you may be wishing for one moment more to bathe in the quiet comfort","last_updated":"2017-11-24T12:06:30.796Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b80f00866be7ea851d6f36725b0dacfe4041a88","dn":"Mindy Smith-One Moment More and self titled (2 CDs)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"6b80f00866be7ea851d6f36725b0dacfe4041a88","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,128,240,8,102,190,126,168,81,214,243,103,37,176,218,207,228,4,26,136]},"name":"Mindy Smith-One Moment More and self titled (2 CDs)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
