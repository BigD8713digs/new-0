Now, Find Your Why picks up where Start with Why left off. It tells you how to apply Simon Sinek&apos;s powerful insights so you can find more inspiration at work - and, in turn, inspire those around you.\r\n\r\nI believe fulfillment is a right and not a privilege. We are all entitled to wake up in the morning inspired to go to work, feel safe when we&apos;re there, and return home fulfilled at the end of the day. Achieving that fulfillment starts with understanding exactly why we do what we do.\r\n\r\nAs Start with Why has spread around the world, countless people have asked me the same question: How can I apply Start with Why to my career, team, company, or nonprofit? Along with two of my colleagues, Peter Docker and David Mead, I created this hands-on, step-by-step guide to help you find your Why. With detailed exercises and action steps for every stage of the process, Find Your Why can help you address many important concerns, including:\r\n\r\nWhat if my Why sounds just like my competitor&apos;s?\r\nCan I have more than one Why?\r\nIf my work doesn&apos;t match my Why, what should I do?\r\nWhat if my team can&apos;t agree on our Why?\r\n\r\nWhether you&apos;ve just started your first job, are leading a team, or are CEO of your own company, the exercises in this book will guide you along a path to long-term success and fulfillment - for both you and your colleagues.\r\n\r\nThank you for joining us as we work together to build a world in which more people start with Why. Inspire on!\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-09-06T12:01:01.981Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:17b5fed6c55be998879db512ed24728c653d7faf","dn":"Find Your Why_ A Practical Guide to Discovering Purpose for You ","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"17b5fed6c55be998879db512ed24728c653d7faf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,181,254,214,197,91,233,152,135,157,181,18,237,36,114,140,101,61,127,175]},"name":"Find Your Why_ A Practical Guide to Discovering Purpose for You ","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
