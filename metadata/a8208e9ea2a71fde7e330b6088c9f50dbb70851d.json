Ariely applies this scientific analysis of the human condition in his &quot;Ask Ariely&quot; Q and A column in the Wall Street Journal, in which he responds to readers who write in with personal conundrums ranging from the serious to the curious:\r\n\r\nWhat can you do to stay calm when you&apos;re playing the volatile stock market?\r\n\r\nWhat&apos;s the best way to get someone to stop smoking?\r\n\r\nHow can you maximize the return on your investment at an all-you-can-eat buffet?\r\n\r\nIs it possible to put a price on the human soul?\r\n\r\nCan you ever rationally justify spending thousands of dollars on a Rolex?\r\n\r\nIn Ask Ariely a broad variety of economic, ethical, and emotional dilemmas are explored and addressed through text and images. Using their trademark insight and wit, Ariely and Haefeli help us reflect on how we can reason our way through external and internal challenges. Readers will laugh, learn, and most importantly gain a new perspective on how to deal with the inevitable problems that plague our daily lives.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-06-10T12:13:47.898Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8208e9ea2a71fde7e330b6088c9f50dbb70851d","dn":"Irrationally Yours by Dan Ariely AZW","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"a8208e9ea2a71fde7e330b6088c9f50dbb70851d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,32,142,158,162,167,31,222,126,51,11,96,136,201,245,13,187,112,133,29]},"name":"Irrationally Yours by Dan Ariely AZW","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
