Such as the case with &apos;I Cry I Smile&apos;.It was released the year after his debut  &apos;Garden of Love Light&apos;.Wheras that debut had a very strong (if somewhat sweetend) jazz-rock fusion approch with a lot of thudding drums and improvisation this recording is Narada focusing strong on the pop/R&amp;B side of his nature. Sometimes some funk,sometimes rock influences but mostly this features a lot of gentle,soulful lite pop taken at medium tempos-certainly that is the case with &quot;I Need Your Love&quot;,&quot;I Remember&quot; and the album closer &quot;So Long&quot;. The presense of Herbie Mann certainly adds his signiture stylings on flute to the airy quality of this music. As far as the other songs go the shuffling &quot;Better Man&quot; is certainly a pleasant listen. Now &quot;Soul Bird&quot; is one of Narada&apos;s little masterpieces-a soulfully funky journey through his own spiritual meditations (a common theme to be explored later in Narada&apos;s music) as he &quot;waits for his soul to set him free&quot;. &quot;Oneness-Cry&quot; features a spiraling guitar solo very much in the Carlos Santana style and is the only instrumental here,and also the only song with a strong fusion reference... - AndreG, rateyourmusic.com","last_updated":"2017-08-13T12:03:58.062Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ffcc3867609c7ba47bdd3feb83ad2fd03970c96","dn":"Narada Michael Walden 1977 I Cry, I Smile (vinyl)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"8ffcc3867609c7ba47bdd3feb83ad2fd03970c96","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,252,195,134,118,9,199,186,71,189,211,254,184,58,210,253,3,151,12,150]},"name":"Narada Michael Walden 1977 I Cry, I Smile (vinyl)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
