Sylvia Plath masterfully draws the reader into Esther&apos;s breakdown with such intensity that Esther&apos;s insanity becomes completely real and even rational, as probable and accessible an experience as going to the movies. Such deep penetration into the dark and harrowing corners of the psyche is an extraordinary accomplishment and has made The Bell Jar a haunting American classic.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-07-18T12:00:20.410Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:c6cf513f31397d89fb7a697fd9917f83efc9c34b","dn":"The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath epub RtR","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"c6cf513f31397d89fb7a697fd9917f83efc9c34b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,207,81,63,49,57,125,137,251,122,105,127,217,145,127,131,239,201,195,75]},"name":"The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath epub RtR","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
