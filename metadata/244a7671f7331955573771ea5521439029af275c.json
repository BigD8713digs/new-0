Effia is married off to an Englishman and will live in comfort in the palatial rooms of Cape Coast Castle, raising children who will be sent abroad to be educated before returning to the Gold Coast to serve as administrators of the empire. Esi, imprisoned beneath Effia in the castle&apos;s women&apos;s dungeon and then shipped off on a boat bound for America, will be sold into slavery.\r\n\r\nStretching from the wars of Ghana to slavery and the Civil War in America, from the coal mines in the American South to the Great Migration to 20th-century Harlem, Yaa Gyasi&apos;s novel moves through histories and geographies and captures - with outstanding economy and force - the troubled spirit of our own nation. She has written a modern masterpiece.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-12-31T12:06:40.019Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:244a7671f7331955573771ea5521439029af275c","dn":"Homegoing by Yaa Gyasi EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"244a7671f7331955573771ea5521439029af275c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,74,118,113,247,51,25,85,87,55,113,234,85,33,67,144,41,175,39,92]},"name":"Homegoing by Yaa Gyasi EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
