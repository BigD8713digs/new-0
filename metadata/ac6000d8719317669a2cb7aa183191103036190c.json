Leaving a note behind for his wife, he wrapped a noose around his neck and changed his life by embracing death. Turns out, the afterlife was nothing like he&apos;d expected. Stations await those who&apos;ve passed on. Who you were in life determines your &quot;Forever Station&quot;.\r\n\r\nThose who&apos;ve taken their own lives will find themselves temporary residents of Suicide Station, where they receive counseling, friendship, and (for Foster) the prospect of love. Candy. The very embodiment of beauty and grace has eyes for our accidental hero. Unfortunately, for Foster, the tether to his old life begs him to return. When he does manage to slip the bonds of death, Foster Donovan discovers a very different punch line.\r\n\r\nSuicide Station is a paranormal romance with a twist even the grim reaper wouldn&apos;t see coming.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-10-31T12:04:57.563Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac6000d8719317669a2cb7aa183191103036190c","dn":"Suicide Station by Jack Wallen EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"ac6000d8719317669a2cb7aa183191103036190c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,96,0,216,113,147,23,102,154,44,183,170,24,49,145,16,48,54,25,12]},"name":"Suicide Station by Jack Wallen EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
