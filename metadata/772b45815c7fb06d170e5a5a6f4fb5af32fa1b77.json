B. YEHOSHUA (b. 1936) is an internationally-acclaimed Israeli novelist, essayist, and playwright.  His works have been published in translation in 28 countries, and many have been adapted for film, television, theatre, and opera.  He has won the National Jewish Book Award and the Koret Jewish Book Award in the U.S, and the Israel Prize for literature.\n\nDescribed by The New York Times as &quot;a kind of Israeli Faulkner,&quot; Yehoshua became a notable figure in the &quot;new wave&quot; generation of Israeli writers who have a particular gift for capturing the mood of contemporary Israel.  In a style which has been called &quot;anti-stream of consciousness,&quot; his work highlights issues of national identity and anti-Semitism, uncovering the animal instincts which threaten the facade of civilized people and examining their isolation from each other, their community and themselves.\n\nIn both THE LOVER (1976) and A LATE DIVORCE (1982) he explores the confrontation between the philosophy of his generation and the ideology of the Zionist founders.  His most celebrated novel, MR MANI (1989), is a complex multigenerational look at Jewish identity and Israel through five conversations that go backwards in time to cover over 200 years of Jewish life in Jerusalem and around the Mediterranean basin.  FRIENDLY FIRE (2007) explores the nature of dysfunctional family relationships in a drama that here moves back and forth between Israel and Tanzania.\n\n\nThis is an updated version of an earlier torrent.
