It&apos;s very easy to miss the big picture. Many of us act like the person who comes into a room halfway through a movie and who starts complaining that the plot is hard to follow. Phil Moore helps us to see the big picture in God&apos;s great story. The Bible is 66 books, 1,189 chapters and 31,102 verses long. It was written by at least 44 authors in 9 countries in 3 continents in 3 languages and over a period of 2,000 years. Nevertheless, one overarching story runs throughout the Bible from start to finish. Phil Moore&apos;s style is punchy and engaging, and the text is fast-paced and succinct. It is sure to be a hit with readers keen to get to grips with the wider narrative of the Bible.\r\n\r\nPlease seed.  Thanks!","last_updated":"2018-01-27T12:12:43.127Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f609f54bb421bede73b14c7acee57816c82f2eb","dn":"The Bible in 100 Pages -  Phil Moore  epub/mobi","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"7f609f54bb421bede73b14c7acee57816c82f2eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,96,159,84,187,66,27,237,231,59,20,199,172,238,87,129,108,130,242,235]},"name":"The Bible in 100 Pages -  Phil Moore  epub/mobi","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
