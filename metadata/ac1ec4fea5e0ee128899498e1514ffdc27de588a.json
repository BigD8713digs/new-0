Anarchism arose in a period of inequality and social unrest. The words &#x201C;war on terror&#x201D; were first applied to the late 19th-century fight against anarchists. Despite the diversity of thought among anarchists, the popular perception has remained remarkably static from opponents on both left and right &#x2013; seeing them largely as violent nihilists. NO GODS NO MASTERS goes a long way towards rectifying that view, and raises the question of whether anarchist thought could appeal to a new generation of activists too.\r\n\r\nReviews:\r\n&quot;Examines the rise and decline of anarchism, from its birth in France to its crushing defeat during the 1930s Spanish Civil War... The documentary covers anarchism as an immigrant issue, the rise of trade unions, and the role of women... Political junkies and history buffs will appreciate.
