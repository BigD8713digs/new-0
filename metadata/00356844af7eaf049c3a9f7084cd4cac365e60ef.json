Furthermore, this song draws upon some of the challenges which bitcoin has experienced and addresses the current financial climate and environment as being ancient, outdated, and due for replacement by blockchain. This track is dedicated to bitcoin, blockchain, and was written, performed, and mixed by a tech geek for all the tech geeks around the world. Great minds think alike.\r\n\r\nLyrics Written and Performed by: Saint Ignatius (Also Known As St. Ignatius of Cyberspace)\r\nMusic used: Ever Felt pt.1 by Otis McDonald\r\nLicensed under Creative Commons Attribution 3.0\r\nSong Mixed and Mastered by: Saint Ignatius of Cyberspace\r\n <a href=\"\nhttp://www.saintignati.us\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttp://www.saintignati.us</a> <a href=\"\nhttp://www.apptyze.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttp://www.apptyze.com</a>\r\n\r\nBinary Gospell EP (The Album):\r\n\r\nThe Binary Gospell EP is a Raspberry Pi project currently in the works and is a hip-hop studio album by Saint Ignatius of Cyberspace, expected to be fully completed and launched by end of 2018.

The Roots), while the lyrical content and rhymes will be driven by principles of lyricism which will cover a wide range of topics belonging to the lifestyle of a typical millennial geek (ex. Saint Ignatius of Cyberspace). \r\n\r\n\r\nBTC: 1Pu1ymV3gb622E3GcTRPt2YZmomMzKyHES\r\nETH: 0x700f358098df656c57abecb2c61f664efdd1f97d\r\nLTC: LTbXoG7UXaLhJCA1dbyoCgQvc2mSR67eTk","last_updated":"2018-08-26T12:02:30.025Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:00356844af7eaf049c3a9f7084cd4cac365e60ef","dn":"Dinosaurs (Tribute to Blockchai) By Saint Ignatius of Cyberspace","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"00356844af7eaf049c3a9f7084cd4cac365e60ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,53,104,68,175,126,175,4,156,58,159,112,132,205,76,172,54,94,96,239]},"name":"Dinosaurs (Tribute to Blockchai) By Saint Ignatius of Cyberspace","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
