The fishing&apos;s good, so they take their catch to a nearby ranch where Guy and his friends fry up the fish, along with some chicken parmesan, for the evening feast. In New Orleans, Guy searches for the perfect po&apos; boy in the back of an off-the-beaten path grocery store before visiting Johnny Sanchez, where Chef Aaron Sanchez shows Guy how to make ceviche and a soft-shell crab sandwich. Finally, a canoe tour of the bayou ends with a festive crawfish boil in fine Cajun form.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal Air Date: 01-Sep-2017","last_updated":"2017-09-04T12:03:26.393Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:9bb8ffb51fd45851c09b9314d3f74e50fdf6736c","dn":"Guys.Family.Road.Trip.S01E04.Gulf.Dreams.WEB-DL.x264-JIVE.mp4","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"9bb8ffb51fd45851c09b9314d3f74e50fdf6736c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,184,255,181,31,212,88,81,192,155,147,20,211,247,78,80,253,246,115,108]},"name":"Guys.Family.Road.Trip.S01E04.Gulf.Dreams.WEB-DL.x264-JIVE.mp4","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
