Schonfield, who once said: &quot;The scholars deplore that I have spilled the beans to the public. Several of them have said to me, &apos;You ought to have kept this just among ourselves, you know.&apos;&quot;\r\n\r\nWhat he did to &quot;spill the beans&quot; was present historical evidence suggesting that Jesus was a mortal man, a young genius who believed himself to be the Messiah and deliberately and brilliantly planned his entire ministry according to the Old Testament prophecies - even to the extent of plotting his own arrest, crucifixion and resurrection.\r\n\r\nSince Schonfield&apos;s death in 1988, his popularity and the interest in his prodigious work, which included over 40 books, has drawn increasing attention, particularly outside Judaism. In fact, it is probably fair to say that his contribution to the Gentile understanding of Jewish aspirations among those within the Christian cultural framework has been without parallel. In true Christian tradition, he has also been the cause of much contention.\r\n\r\nThis 40th anniversary edition of The Passover Plot is set to engage a completely new generation of readers searching for truth","last_updated":"2017-06-05T12:04:07.504Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:f868347d0f88564243107a986b757448812fc354","dn":"The Passover Plot: The Life and Death of Jesus Christ","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"f868347d0f88564243107a986b757448812fc354","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,104,52,125,15,136,86,66,67,16,122,152,107,117,116,72,129,47,195,84]},"name":"The Passover Plot: The Life and Death of Jesus Christ","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
