This time I really mean it. &apos;The Perpetuum Space Mobile Vehicle&apos; is one of the year&#x2019;s most exciting records. The music has held me spellbound for over four days now. It made my neighbours screaming baby silent in a few seconds, although my neighbour wasn&apos;t too impressed, but that&apos;s another story.\r\nI think the music feels playful and ingenious; maybe it&apos;s because of the really beautiful cover I got this feeling. I don&apos;t know. However, this is a record that makes me feel joy when listening to it and it let&apos;s my fantasy flow.\r\nWith sounds, beats, noise and melodies Bardoseneticcube &amp; Igor V. Petrov creates a complex music that is still very easy to listen to. I don&apos;t think this is music that suits everyone but I do think that most people can enjoy it if they get the chance to listen to it without being disturbed or distracted. I really hope that I will hear more of this in the future. - John Wikstrom, Mechanoise Labs","last_updated":"2017-07-22T12:01:11.270Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:c95559e7a455dfd8c227c3d4a4252045c0e56f79","dn":"Bardoseneticcube &amp; Igor Petrov 2006 The Perpetuum Mobile","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"c95559e7a455dfd8c227c3d4a4252045c0e56f79","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,85,89,231,164,85,223,216,194,39,195,212,164,37,32,69,192,229,111,121]},"name":"Bardoseneticcube &amp; Igor Petrov 2006 The Perpetuum Mobile","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
