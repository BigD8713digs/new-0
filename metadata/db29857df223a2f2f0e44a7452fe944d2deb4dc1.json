As a United States Marine sniper in Vietnam, his astonishing accuracy with a rifle earned him the nickname &quot;Bob the Nailer;&quot; 20 years later he was forced to kill again to unravel a brutal conspiracy. Now happily secluded with his wife and young daughter in the Arizona desert, Bob believes all the killing is behind him. Until a young writer, Russ Pewtie, arrives at his door with troubling questions about the past.\r\n\r\n40 years earlier, Swagger&apos;s father, a dedicated state trooper, was gunned down by two robbers in a sensational shoot-out just outside of Blue Eye, Arkansas. Faced with Russ&apos; persistence and a desire to make peace with a father he never really knew, Swagger decides to discover what really happened that night long ago in Arkansas. But it soon becomes clear that powerful people don&apos;t want the truth uncovered - and Swagger must use all his combat skills and ruthless cunning just to survive.\r\n\r\nLike the infrared &quot;black light&quot; that exposes a sniper&apos;s target in the dead of night, Swagger homes in on the shadowy figures desperate to keep the secret of his father&apos;s murder buried. And with the relentless pace that is Stephen Hunter&apos;s trademark, Black Light accelerates to its exhilarating climax - an explosion of gunfire that blasts open the secrets of two generations.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-07-16T12:00:27.898Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:db29857df223a2f2f0e44a7452fe944d2deb4dc1","dn":"Black Light (Bob Lee Swagger series_book 2) by Stephen Hunter ep","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"db29857df223a2f2f0e44a7452fe944d2deb4dc1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,41,133,125,242,35,162,242,240,228,74,116,82,254,148,77,45,235,77,193]},"name":"Black Light (Bob Lee Swagger series_book 2) by Stephen Hunter ep","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
