With wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall) and psychic son Danny (Danny Lloyd) in tow, frustrated writer Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) takes a job as the winter caretaker at the opulently ominous, mountain-locked Overlook Hotel so that he can write in peace. Before the Overlook is vacated for the Torrances, the manager (Barry Nelson) informs Jack that a previous caretaker went crazy and slaughtered his family; Jack thinks it&apos;s no problem, but Danny&apos;s &quot;shining&quot; hints otherwise. Settling into their routine, Danny cruises through the empty corridors on his Big Wheel and plays in the topiary maze with Wendy, while Jack sets up shop in a cavernous lounge with strict orders not to be disturbed. Danny&apos;s alter ego, &quot;Tony,&quot; however, starts warning of &quot;redrum&quot; as Danny is plagued by more blood-soaked visions of the past, and a blocked Jack starts visiting the hotel bar for a few visions of his own. Frightened by her husband&apos;s behavior and Danny&apos;s visit to the forbidding Room 237, Wendy soon discovers what Jack has really been doing in his study all day, and what the hotel has done to Jack.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTARS.........: Jack Nicholson, Shelley Duvall, Danny Lloyd \r\nDIRECTOR......: Stanley Kubrick\r\nWRITERS.......: Stephen King (novel), Stanley Kubrick (screenplay)\r\nGENRE.........: Horror, Mystery\r\nMETASCORE.....: 63\r\nTOMATOMETER...: 87\r\nIMDB RATING...: 8.4/10  692,486 votes\r\nIMDB LINK.....: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081505\r\nRUNTIME.......: 1h 59mn\r\nSIZE..........: 4.29GB\r\nVIDEO CODEC...: HEVC (<a href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection\" class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"87cae6eee9c7cbb3\">[email&#xA0;protected]</a>)\r\nBITRATE.......: 4500 Kbps (2 pass)\r\nRESOLUTION....: 1920x1080\r\nASPECT RATIO..: 1.77:1\r\nFRAMERATE.....: 23.976 fps\r\nAUDIO1........: English E-AC3 5.1 512Kbps\r\nAUDIO2........: Commentary with Garrett Brown and John Baxter\r\nSUBTITLES.....: ENG, CHI, DUT, FIN, GER, ITA, JAP, KOR, POR, SPA\r\nCHAPTERS......: Yes\r\nSOURCE........: The.Shining.1980.BD25.UNTOUCHED.VIDEO.LPCM\r\nENCODED BY....: Sartre\r\nENCODE DATE...: 2017-12-19\r\n\r\n\r\n&quot;The 144 minute &apos;US version&apos; is often erroneously called the Director&apos;s Cut when in fact director Kubrick regarded the 113 minute version as the superior cut of the film.
