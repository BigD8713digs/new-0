Zeihan argues that the future is undoubtedly bright for America, the only country with enough young adults to fill the capital-generating void that will be left behind by 2030. The Accidental Superpower also explores shale oil and its surprising key role in America&apos;s move toward energy independence and how it will shape (and is already shaping) American life for the next 50 years.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-03-13T12:16:26.137Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b996286a0757d64fb1e2d5f352640492ad7dc54","dn":"The Accidental Superpower by Peter Zeihan EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"3b996286a0757d64fb1e2d5f352640492ad7dc54","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,153,98,134,160,117,125,100,251,30,45,95,53,38,64,73,42,215,220,84]},"name":"The Accidental Superpower by Peter Zeihan EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
