At its center is a romance: the story of the author&apos;s relationship with the artist Harry Dodge. This story, which includes Nelson&apos;s account of falling in love with Dodge, who is fluidly gendered, as well as her journey to and through a pregnancy, is an intimate portrayal of the complexities and joys of (queer) family making.\r\n\r\nWriting in the spirit of public intellectuals such as Susan Sontag and Roland Barthes, Nelson binds her personal experience to a rigorous exploration of what iconic theorists have said about sexuality, gender, and the vexed institutions of marriage and child-rearing. Nelson&apos;s insistence on radical individual freedom and the value of caretaking becomes the rallying cry of this thoughtful, unabashed, uncompromising book.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-06-10T12:13:45.748Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:53ceece8997fa16bff3c5308073db6fb08b16c06","dn":"The Argonauts by Maggie Nelson AZW","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"53ceece8997fa16bff3c5308073db6fb08b16c06","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,206,236,232,153,127,161,107,255,60,83,8,7,61,182,251,8,177,108,6]},"name":"The Argonauts by Maggie Nelson AZW","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
