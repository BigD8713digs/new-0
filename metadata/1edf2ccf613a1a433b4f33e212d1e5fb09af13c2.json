Dick EPUB\r\n\r\nGod is not dead. He has merely been exiled to an extraterrestrial planet. And it is on this planet that God meets Herb Asher and persuades him to help retake Earth from the demonic Belial.\r\n\r\nFeaturing virtual reality, parallel worlds, and interstellar travel, The Divine Invasion blends philosophy and adventure in a way few authors can achieve. As the middle novel of Dick&#x2019;s VALIS trilogy, The Divine Invasion plays a pivotal role in answering the questions raised by the first novel, expanding that world while exploring just how much anyone can really know - even God himself.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-12-10T12:08:15.927Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:1edf2ccf613a1a433b4f33e212d1e5fb09af13c2","dn":"The Divine Invasion (Valis, Book 2) by Philip K.
