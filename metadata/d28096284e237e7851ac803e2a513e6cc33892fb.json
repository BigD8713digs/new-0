But who are they? Where did ISIS come from, and how did they rise to power in so little time? What is driving them - and how can they be stopped?\r\n\r\nNew York Times best-selling author Robert Spencer reveals the blood-drenched history and inner workings of the Islamic State - its military conquests, how it is financing its expansion, and the ideology that is driving its success. As Spencer reveals, the Islamic State has taken the first steps on the path to becoming a serious world power - steps that Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda dreamed of but were afraid to take. The Complete Infidel&apos;s Guide to ISIS is your one-stop easy reference for all you need to know about ISIS - and how &quot;infidels&quot; can stop its reign of terror.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-08-10T12:00:38.302Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:d28096284e237e7851ac803e2a513e6cc33892fb","dn":"The Complete Infidel's Guide to ISIS by Robert Spencer ePUB eBOO","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"d28096284e237e7851ac803e2a513e6cc33892fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,128,150,40,78,35,126,120,81,172,128,62,42,81,62,108,195,56,146,251]},"name":"The Complete Infidel's Guide to ISIS by Robert Spencer ePUB eBOO","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
