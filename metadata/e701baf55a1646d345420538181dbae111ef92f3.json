Everything in state of constant orbital motion. Perform orbital maneuvers and keep your space ships on stable orbits to prevent crashing on a planet or loosing ship in deep space.The physics simulates in 2D space, this makes flying and navigation enjoyable and easy but also generates a lot of interesting situations due physical collisions which are more often in 2D space than in 3D.Fully Customizable Ships and Space stationsYou can build your own ship part by part. Each part of the ship is individual, it has own functions and parameters. Therefore, abilities of your ship are completely dependent on the modules from which it is assembled. You can build small explorers, large industrial ships, carriers, defense satellites or whatever you want.Each module","last_updated":"2017-07-01T12:03:01.573Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:e701baf55a1646d345420538181dbae111ef92f3","dn":"Celestial Command v0.8.7","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"e701baf55a1646d345420538181dbae111ef92f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,1,186,245,90,22,70,211,69,66,5,56,24,29,186,225,17,239,146,243]},"name":"Celestial Command v0.8.7","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
