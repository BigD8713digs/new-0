All members live scattered between Berlin, Cologne and Hamburg. They meet rarely and abruptly, but when they do each of them always has the feeling that something relevant needs to be done. \r\nTheir first release, Render, marked the start of Cologne label Magazine in 2010 and now after several years of silence, their new record Welt is here. Eight musical arrangements, all of which answer to the same name and only differ numerically in their title. They were performed and recorded at the Dumbo Studios in Cologne, during which the nine Cologne Tape members gathered in a room with the goal of recording new material but no set path to get there. \r\nThose unfiltered emotions were later refined with drums and synths by Stanier and Willner, and then arranged into a dramatic story arc under the direction of Jens-Uwe Beyer. Some of the Welt recordings feature friends of the collective such as Mexican artist Rebolledo, the guitarist Burkhard M&#xF6;nnich and the singer Isis Lace, who all happened to be close by and joined the band spontaneously during their musical ritual. \r\nWelt tells a story of deeply felt musical experiences &#x2013; their music enables the listener to enter a world of sounds and rhythms, which all reflect in depth what Cologne Tape is as a band and a piece of art. \r\n\r\nTracklist: \r\n01 - Welt 1.flac \r\n02 - Welt 2.flac \r\n03 - Welt 3 (Magazine Edit).flac \r\n04 - Welt 4.flac \r\n05 - Welt 5.flac \r\n06 - Welt 6.flac \r\n07 - Welt 7.flac \r\n08 - Welt 8.flac \r\n\r\nSummary: \r\nCountry: Germany \r\nGenre: electronic, post-rock","last_updated":"2018-05-06T12:17:58.470Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca53c3c4a9ba594aa98e92a286668f5fae8c875c","dn":"[electronic, post-rock] (2017) Cologne Tape - Welt [FLAC,Tracks]","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"ca53c3c4a9ba594aa98e92a286668f5fae8c875c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,83,195,196,169,186,89,74,169,142,146,162,134,102,143,95,174,140,135,92]},"name":"[electronic, post-rock] (2017) Cologne Tape - Welt [FLAC,Tracks]","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
