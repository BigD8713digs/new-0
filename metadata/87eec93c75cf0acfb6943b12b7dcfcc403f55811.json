Watching the action of Paul Kersey (Charles Bronson) killing criminals armed with a pistol giving a colleague, who considers possession of firearms by civilians synonymous with a decline in crime rates, is now certainly disturbing. The reason is clear: gun control issue. Through his remake, Eli Roth actually does not give a counter-argument. The decision to release his film 16 days after the shooting incident at Stoneman Douglas High School would make Death Wish difficult for the American public.\r\nIf noted, the manuscript was written by Joe Carnahan many disarm the political subtext of the original film. The discussion of whether or not the need for vigilantism in the middle of the lack of police is still on, but his role as a pioneer for Bruce Willis hitting bullets into the body of his quarry. The focus is on kinship. The family is Dr Paul Kersey (Bruce Willis), a surgeon. Kersey lives with his wife, Lucy (Elisabeth Shue) and his daughter, Jordan (Camila Morrone), who is preparing to study in New York. Every now and then, Paul&apos;s sister Frank (Vincent D&apos;Onofrio) comes together","last_updated":"2018-04-12T17:05:24.733Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:87eec93c75cf0acfb6943b12b7dcfcc403f55811","dn":"Death Wish 2018.HD.avi","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"87eec93c75cf0acfb6943b12b7dcfcc403f55811","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,238,201,60,117,207,10,207,182,148,59,18,183,220,252,196,3,245,88,17]},"name":"Death Wish 2018.HD.avi","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
