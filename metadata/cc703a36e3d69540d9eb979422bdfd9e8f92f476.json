In Boston, a renowned hand surgeon awaits the opportunity to perform the nation&apos;s first hand transplant; meanwhile, in the distracting aftermath of an acrimonious divorce, the surgeon is seduced by his housekeeper. A married woman in Wisconsin wants to give the one-handed reporter her husband&apos;s left hand - that is, after her husband dies. But the husband is alive, relatively young, and healthy.\r\n\r\nThis is how John Irving&apos;s tenth novel begins; it seems, at first, to be a comedy, perhaps a satire, almost certainly a sexual farce. Yet, in the end, The Fourth Hand is as realistic and emotionally moving as any of Mr. Irving&apos;s previous novels.\r\n\r\nThe Fourth Hand is characteristic of John Irving&apos;s seamless storytelling and further explores some of the author&apos;s recurring themes - loss, grief, love as redemption. But this novel also breaks new ground; it offers a penetrating look at the power of second chances and the will to change","last_updated":"2017-06-29T12:00:29.849Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc703a36e3d69540d9eb979422bdfd9e8f92f476","dn":"The Fourth Hand by John Irving epub RtR","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"cc703a36e3d69540d9eb979422bdfd9e8f92f476","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,112,58,54,227,214,149,64,217,235,151,148,34,189,253,158,143,146,244,118]},"name":"The Fourth Hand by John Irving epub RtR","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
