Not moving my head, I direct my eyes to a point halfway up the archway where Kim Jong-il&#x2019;s face will soon appear.\r\n\r\nAs North Korea&apos;s State Poet Laureate, Jang Jin-sung led a charmed life. With food provisions (even as the country suffered through its great famine), a travel pass, access to strictly censored information, and audiences with Kim Jong-il himself, his life in Pyongyang seemed safe and secure. But this privileged existence was about to be shattered. When a strictly forbidden magazine he lent to a friend goes missing, Jang Jin-sung must flee for his life.\r\n\r\nNever before has a member of the elite described the inner workings of this totalitarian state and its propaganda machine. An astonishing expos&#xE9; told through the heart-stopping story of Jang Jin-sung&apos;s escape to South Korea, Dear Leader is a rare and unprecedented insight into the world&#x2019;s most secretive and repressive regime.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-02-05T12:04:36.337Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:24d7b76e8732bbda0ea20ecedda566b539e40be5","dn":"Dear Leader_ A Look inside North Korea by Jang Jin-sung EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"24d7b76e8732bbda0ea20ecedda566b539e40be5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,215,183,110,135,50,187,218,14,162,14,206,221,165,102,181,57,228,11,229]},"name":"Dear Leader_ A Look inside North Korea by Jang Jin-sung EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
