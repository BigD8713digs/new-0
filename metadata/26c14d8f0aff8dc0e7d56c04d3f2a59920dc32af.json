The Lost Boys are back, and they&apos;ll do anything to get what they want.\r\n\r\nTom Natsworthy and Hester Shaw are happy in the safety of a static settlement, but their daughter, Wren, is desperate for adventure.\r\n\r\nWhen a dangerously charming submarine pirate offers her a chance to escape, Wren doesn&apos;t think twice about leaving her home and her parents behind.\r\n\r\nBut the pirate wants something in return--Wren must steal the mysterious Tin Book.\r\n\r\nTo do so will ignite a conflict that could tear the whole world apart.\r\n\r\nWhen the theft of the mysterious Tin Book of Anchorage goes wrong, Wren is snatched away in the limpet, who knows where.\r\n\r\nTom and Hester set off to rescue her, but this is the end of their quiet life on Anchorage.\r\n\r\nThe journey will stir up old needs, old secrets - and send them into perilous waters...\r\n\r\n\r\nRead by: Vanessa Maroney\r\n\r\nFormat : Stereo mp3\r\n\r\nBitrate: 128kbps/44.1hz","last_updated":"2018-02-05T12:11:13.529Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:26c14d8f0aff8dc0e7d56c04d3f2a59920dc32af","dn":"Infernal Devices [The Hungry City Chronicles #3] - Philip Reeve","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"26c14d8f0aff8dc0e7d56c04d3f2a59920dc32af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,193,77,143,10,255,141,192,231,213,108,4,211,242,165,153,32,220,50,175]},"name":"Infernal Devices [The Hungry City Chronicles #3] - Philip Reeve","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
