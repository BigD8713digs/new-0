There is a heavy emphasis on immersion, survival, and relative realism. A few other mods have been added (listed below) to enhance the experience, while still retaining the challenge. Call of Misery is standalone and can be run directly by launching Stalker-CoC.exe, however a copy of Call of Pripyat is required for legal reasons.\r\n\r\nMods in this build:\r\n-------------------\r\nCall of Chernobyl 1.4.16 - Team EPIC\r\ncall of Misery 1.0d + English translation - MISERY Team\r\nSTCoM weapon pack + Fix 4 - Darryl123\r\nGore Mod 1.2 + Fix 2 - Kahvana\r\nEnemies Don&apos;t Always Drop Broken Guns - STCoM Edition - crazycombine\r\nSTCom Low condition trading -Sonkorino\r\nScopes + Batteries Icons Distinction - Darvin76\r\n\r\nGame config edits:\r\n------------------\r\n-Rebalanced stamina system: Sprinting is no longer as tiring when carrying a light load.\r\n-Incremental health regen: Slowly heal over time as long as you are otherwise healthy.\r\n-Rebalanced mutant&apos;s passive psi field range: 20-25M for all creatures, down from ~50M for some.\r\n-Health reduced for the tankish mutants: They are still deadly as ever.\r\n\r\nInstalling\r\n----------\r\nSimply copy the folder anywhere and run Stalker-CoC.exe. DO NOT combine with your Call of Pripyat game, CoM is standalone and only needs Call of Pripyat installed on the system to have a valid CD key","last_updated":"2017-10-15T12:02:57.826Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:aae223c667ebc81c86dc189e3200290ee2622524","dn":"S.T.A.L.K.E.R. - Call of Misery (Custom: read description)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"aae223c667ebc81c86dc189e3200290ee2622524","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,226,35,198,103,235,200,28,134,220,24,158,50,0,41,14,226,98,37,36]},"name":"S.T.A.L.K.E.R. - Call of Misery (Custom: read description)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
