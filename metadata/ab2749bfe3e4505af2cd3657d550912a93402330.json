In A Garden of Earthly Delights, Oates presents one of her most memorable heroines, Clara Walpole, the beautiful daughter of Kentucky-born migrant farmworkers. Desperate to rise above her haphazard existence of violence and poverty, determined not to repeat her mother&#x2019;s life, Clara struggles for independence by way of her relationships with four very different men: her father, a family man turned itinerant laborer, smoldering with resentment; the mysterious Lowry, who rescues Clara as a teenager and offers her the possibility of love; Revere, a wealthy landowner who provides Clara with stability; and Swan, Clara&#x2019;s son, who bears the psychological and spiritual burden of his mother&#x2019;s ambition.\r\n\r\n\r\n [Garden of Earthly Delights 02] - Expensive People (Wonderland Quartet #2)\r\n\r\nOates&apos;s third novel, originally published in 1968, is the riveting story of a child murderer told by the killer himself.
