The group&apos;s music is a mixture of weird, neurotic, disturbing and sad ballads, resembling some deconstructed Velvet Underground songs, combined with the sound effects, which may remind of the Japanese minimal, ambient and glitch. Musicians rarely play on stage and mostly for very small audiences.  Most of the songs are available to free download.\r\n\r\n2017 new album was recorded in Vietnam, Poland, Germany and Belarus and had good reviews in russian/belarus experimental music related media","last_updated":"2018-01-05T12:03:24.833Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:85d7b0ad659b8ddaf104a9656e561667f793722a","dn":"Autonomicon  Icarus Messerschmitt  2017","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"85d7b0ad659b8ddaf104a9656e561667f793722a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,215,176,173,101,155,141,218,241,4,169,101,110,86,22,103,247,147,114,42]},"name":"Autonomicon  Icarus Messerschmitt  2017","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
