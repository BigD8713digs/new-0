As it seems, crackers of \r\n a couple of groups failed to reverse-engineer or understand this awesome \r\n piece of work! To give a quick overview of how we managed to defeat this \r\n protection:\r\n * Created a set of tools which decompiled the solidshield vm into a set of \r\n raw x86 programs (including all stolen functions)\r\n * Stripped all calls to TAGES from those functions and compiled them into \r\n x86 blocks (with relocation info included).\r\n * Created our own &quot;dvm.dll&quot; library, which decrypts those precompiled and\r\n fully reversed stolen functions (they are added as overlay data in the dll), \r\n moves them to alloced buffers, fixes relocations and adds E9 jmps from all \r\n of the protected modules to point to them. \r\n That&apos;s it! Was it really so hard to check this? We had some mild respect \r\n to your crackers, but hey - it&apos;s all gone now.\r\n\r\n \r\n Game info:\r\n ~~~~~~~~~~\r\n Grand Theft Auto: Episodes from Liberty City includes two complete games -\r\n The Lost and Damned &amp; The Ballad of Gay Tony - together on disc for \r\n PlayStation 3 computer entertainment system and Games for Windows. In The \r\n Lost and Damned, experience Liberty City as Johnny, a veteran member of The \r\n Lost, a notorious biker gang. Johnny has been creating business \r\n opportunities for The Lost in Liberty City but his first loyalty must be to \r\n the patch he wears on his back and to Billy Grey, the club&apos;s President. \r\n However, when Billy returns from rehab hell-bent on bloodshed and debauchery,\r\n Johnny finds himself in the middle of a vicious turf war with rival gangs \r\n for control of a city torn apart by violence and corruption. Can the \r\n brotherhood survive? The Ballad of Gay Tony injects Liberty City with an \r\n overdose of guns, glitz, and grime. As Luis Lopez, part-time hoodlum and \r\n full-time assistant to legendary nightclub impresario Tony Prince (a.k.a. \r\n &quot;Gay Tony&quot;, players will struggle with the competing loyalties of family \r\n and friends, and with the uncertainty about who is real and who is fake in","last_updated":"2018-03-12T12:54:53.711Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:422c0f23340d84032826a512f223adf682ecf4d0","dn":"Grand.Theft.Auto.Episodes.from.Liberty.City-RELOADED","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"422c0f23340d84032826a512f223adf682ecf4d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,44,15,35,52,13,132,3,40,38,165,18,242,35,173,246,130,236,244,208]},"name":"Grand.Theft.Auto.Episodes.from.Liberty.City-RELOADED","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
