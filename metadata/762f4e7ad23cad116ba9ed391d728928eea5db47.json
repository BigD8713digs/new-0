Stonehenge is the most famous, but there are many other places in the world where big honking rocks are set up in weird ways that make crypto-scientists fidget with glee. \r\nNeurosis singer/guitarist Steve Von Till makes music with his main band that more or less sounds like one of these boulders slowly colliding with your head, but his solo work under his own name and as the drone project Harvestman provides a more placid kind of heaviness, as the new Harvestman album Music for Megaliths demonstrates. \r\nThe album is a great example of the ever-bountiful intersection between heavy metal and experimental music, feeling like the former without ever exploding into pounding riffs and drums. &#x201C;This Forest Is Our Temple&#x201D; (word to Ocarina of Time) fades eerily into existence atop strings and reed instruments as a melancholy acoustic guitar figure anchors the piece together with something resembling folky warmth. &#x201C;Ring of Sentinels&#x201D; allows some programmed electronic drums to disturb the pagan party, and is probably the least ominous thing here, nearly counting as chillout music. But wait until &#x201C;White Horse&#x201D; concludes the LP with bluesy, rough-hewn guitar leads and a dusted monologue from the man behind the music. \r\n&#x201C;&#x2026;Over the course of three albums, Steve Von Till has, under the guise of Harvestman, provided the sonic analogue, casting his net for what might have been and yet still be. Both a personal meditation and a tuning fork for the most ancient and enduring of resonances, his latest album, Music for Megaliths, further expands his journeys along the sonic ley lines that run between folk, drone, psychedelia, the &#x2018;kosmische&#x2019; outposts of krautrock and noise: not as an act of eclecticism, but of divination, giving voice to an underlying continuity that binds them all.&#x201D; \r\n\r\nTracklist: \r\n01-the_forest is our temple.flac \r\n02-oak drone.flac \r\n03-ring of sentinels.flac \r\n04-cromlech.flac \r\n05-levitation.flac \r\n06-sundown.flac \r\n07-white horse.flac \r\n\r\nSummary: \r\nCountry: USA \r\nGenre: post-rock","last_updated":"2018-05-07T12:08:30.331Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:762f4e7ad23cad116ba9ed391d728928eea5db47","dn":"[post-rock] (2017) Harvestman - Music for Megaliths [FLAC,Tracks","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"762f4e7ad23cad116ba9ed391d728928eea5db47","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,47,78,122,210,60,173,17,107,169,237,57,29,114,137,40,238,165,219,71]},"name":"[post-rock] (2017) Harvestman - Music for Megaliths [FLAC,Tracks","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
