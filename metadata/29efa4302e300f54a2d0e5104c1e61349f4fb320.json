Readers with a background in real and complex analysis at the beginning graduate level will feel comfortable with the material presented here. The authors have taken unusual care to motivate concepts and simplify proofs. Topics include: basic properties of harmonic functions, Poisson integrals, the Kelvin transform, spherical harmonics, harmonic Hardy spaces, harmonic Bergman spaces, the decomposition theorem, Laurent expansions, isolated singularities, and the Dirichlet problem. The new edition contains a completely rewritten chapter on spherical harmonics, a new section on extensions of Bocher`s Theorem, new exercises and proofs, as well as revisions throughout to improve the text. A unique software package-designed by the authors and available by email-supplements the text for readers who wish to explore harmonic function theory on a computer.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n <a href=\"\nhttp://dlfeb.com/book/harmonic-function-theory/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttp://dlfeb.com/book/harmonic-function-theory/</a>","last_updated":"2017-08-05T12:05:27.452Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:29efa4302e300f54a2d0e5104c1e61349f4fb320","dn":"HARMONIC FUNCTION THEORY","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"29efa4302e300f54a2d0e5104c1e61349f4fb320","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,239,164,48,46,48,15,84,162,208,229,16,76,30,97,52,159,79,179,32]},"name":"HARMONIC FUNCTION THEORY","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
