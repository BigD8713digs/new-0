Within four days the Soviets had recovered his body. But the truth about what the Russian secret services found was hidden from history, when, three months later, Stalin officially declared to Truman and Churchill that Hitler was still alive and had escaped abroad.

Until now.\r\n\r\nIn 2017, after two years of painstaking negotiations with the Russian authorities, award-winning investigative journalists Jean-Christophe Brisard and Lana Parshina gained access to confidential Soviet files that finally revealed the truth behind the incredible hunt for Hitler&apos;s body.\r\n\r\nGenre: Audiobooks &gt; Non-Fiction\r\n <a href=\"\nhttps://i.imgur.com/OeSzW7J.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://i.imgur.com/OeSzW7J.jpg</a>","last_updated":"2018-09-20T12:21:07.907Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:662b266bf9e30eb2d8717ee56877747e1b61cf1a","dn":"The Death of Hitler by Jean-christophe Brisard  (.mp3) ","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"662b266bf9e30eb2d8717ee56877747e1b61cf1a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,43,38,107,249,227,14,178,216,113,126,229,104,119,116,126,27,97,207,26]},"name":"The Death of Hitler by Jean-christophe Brisard  (.mp3) ","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
