After abandoning his throne and retiring to Los Angeles, Lucifer indulges in his favorite things (women, wine and song) -- until a murder takes place outside of his upscale nightclub. For the first time in billions of years, the murder awakens something unfamiliar in Lucifer&apos;s soul that is eerily similar to compassion and sympathy. Lucifer is faced with another surprise when he meets an intriguing homicide detective named Chloe, who appears to possess an inherent goodness -- unlike the worst of humanity, to which he is accustomed. Suddenly, Lucifer starts to wonder if there is hope for his soul","last_updated":"2017-11-21T12:05:20.631Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a02b1ea684588bffb0ab36b9644cb62e66d062f","dn":"Lucifer.S03E08.720p.HDTV.x264.[330MB].[Season.3.Episode.8]","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"6a02b1ea684588bffb0ab36b9644cb62e66d062f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,2,177,234,104,69,136,191,251,10,179,107,150,68,203,98,230,109,6,47]},"name":"Lucifer.S03E08.720p.HDTV.x264.[330MB].[Season.3.Episode.8]","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
