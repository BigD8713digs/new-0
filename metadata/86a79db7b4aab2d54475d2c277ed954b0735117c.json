Soon this tall, outspoken gal from Pasadena, California, who didn&apos;t speak a word of French and knew nothing about the country, was steeped in the language, chatting with purveyors in the local markets, and enrolled in the Cordon Bleu.\r\n\r\nAfter managing to get her degree despite the machinations of the disagreeable directrice of the school, Julia started teaching cooking classes herself, then teamed up with two fellow gourmettes, Simone Beck and Louisette Bertholle, to help them with a book they were trying to write on French cooking for Americans. Throwing herself heart and soul into making it a unique and thorough teaching book, only to suffer several rounds of painful rejection, is part of the behind-the-scenes drama that Julia reveals with her inimitable gusto and disarming honesty.\r\n\r\nThis memoir is laced with wonderful stories about the French character, particularly in the world of food, and the way of life that Julia embraced so wholeheartedly. Above all, she reveals the kind of spirit and determination, the sheer love of cooking, and the drive to share that with her fellow Americans that made her the extraordinary success she became.\r\n\r\nLe voici. Et bon appetit!\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-08-11T12:00:33.357Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:86a79db7b4aab2d54475d2c277ed954b0735117c","dn":"My Life in France by Julia Child and Alex Prud'Homme PDF eBOOK-Z","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"86a79db7b4aab2d54475d2c277ed954b0735117c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,167,157,183,180,170,178,213,68,117,210,194,119,237,149,75,7,53,17,124]},"name":"My Life in France by Julia Child and Alex Prud'Homme PDF eBOOK-Z","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
