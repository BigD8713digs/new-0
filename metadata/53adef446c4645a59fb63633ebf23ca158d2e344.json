Here, in the tiny village where he passed so many carefree childhood years, he is untroubled by the pressures of the big city and can freely answer the call of his muse. Of course, back in the city Horton didn&apos;t have to run from dinosaurs. There were no cartoon hillbillies offering him moonshine, Don Quixote was content to confine himself to the pages of a book, and the devil himself was not on Horton&apos;s tail. Something very, very unusual is going on in Pilot Knob, and Horton Smith is determined to get to the bottom of it - if his own imagination doesn&apos;t kill him first!\r\n\r\nIn Out of Their Minds, science fiction grand master Clifford D. Simak changes gears, treating his readers to a delightfully satiric flight of fancy and fantasy. An award-winning author renowned for his remarkable visions of the future, Simak brings creatures and characters from humankind&apos;s collective imagination to breathtaking life in this fast-moving and unforgettable tale.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-12-26T12:08:17.200Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:53adef446c4645a59fb63633ebf23ca158d2e344","dn":"Out of Their Minds by Clifford Simak EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"53adef446c4645a59fb63633ebf23ca158d2e344","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,173,239,68,108,70,69,165,159,182,54,51,235,242,60,161,88,210,227,68]},"name":"Out of Their Minds by Clifford Simak EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
