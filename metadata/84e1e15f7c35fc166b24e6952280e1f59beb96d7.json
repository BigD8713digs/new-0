Merged images can then be adjusted by a range of options and settings to get the look that users want -- from natural-looking results using exposure fusion to painterly, surreal or ultra-realistic images using the tone mapping mode.\r\n- Merge to HDR, Tone Mapping and Exposure Fusion\r\n- Automatic Alignment of hand-held photos\r\n- Automatic Ghost Removal and Selective Deghosting tool\r\n- Options for real estate photography\r\n- Automation with Batch Processing\r\n\r\nBenefits for professional photographers:\r\n- Saving on lighting equipment. No need to acquire expensive lighting equipment -and carry it- when you shoot high contrast scenes. Just enable the Auto Exposure Bracketing feature of your camera, and let Photomatix merge your photos into an image with extended dynamic range.\r\n- Great pictures on cloudy days. Shadowless hazy sunlight or an overcast sky usually results in dull-looking photographs. The tone mapping tool of Photomatix can turn them into great-looking images. Check out this image as an example.\r\n- Saving time in post-processing. Photomatix Pro is designed for productivity &#x2014; automatic blending, unlimited stacking, easy comparison of results and batch processing save hours of masking and layers work in image editing programs.\r\n- Well exposed panoramas. A panoramic scene is almost always a high contrast scene &#x2014; you can&#x2019;t limit your view to areas with the same brightness when shooting a 360&#xB0; panorama. By taking views under several exposures and processing them in Photomatix Pro, you can create a panorama that will show details in both the dark and bright areas of the scene. Photomatix Pro offers both exposure fusion (also known as exposure blending) and HDR tone mapping","last_updated":"2018-09-17T12:15:13.817Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:84e1e15f7c35fc166b24e6952280e1f59beb96d7","dn":"HDRsoft Photomatix Pro 6.1.1.Keygen","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"84e1e15f7c35fc166b24e6952280e1f59beb96d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,225,225,95,124,53,252,22,107,36,230,149,34,128,225,245,155,235,150,215]},"name":"HDRsoft Photomatix Pro 6.1.1.Keygen","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
