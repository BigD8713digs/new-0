Ben Gazzara plays Cosmo Vitelli, the owner of a sleazy Los Angeles strip joint, who loses $20,000 at a mob gambling club owned by a small time gangster (Seymour Cassel). Since Cosmo doesn&apos;t have the $20,000, he is forced to murder a Chinese bookie in order to clear his debt to the mob. What Cosmo doesn&apos;t know is he&apos;s part of a set-up. The bookie is actually a West Coast mob boss protected around the clock by bodyguards. The mobsters figure that Cosmo will be killed in an impossible hit and they can take over his nightclub. But Cosmo proves luckier than the mobsters think -- he manages to kill his target, and now the mobsters have to track down Cosmo and kill him. Initially, at 133 minutes, the movie was subsequently re-edited by Cassavetes to 109 minutes and re-released in 1978.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTARS.........: Ben Gazzara, Timothy Carey, Seymour Cassel\r\nDIRECTOR......: John Cassavetes\r\nWRITERS.......: John Cassavetes\r\nGENRE.........: Crime, Drama, Thriller\r\nTOMATOMETER...: 77\r\nIMDB RATING...: 7.5/10  8,436 votes\r\nIMDB LINK.....: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074749\r\nRUNTIME.......: 1h 48mn\r\nSIZE..........: 3.96 GB\r\nVIDEO CODEC...: HEVC (<a href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection\" class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"f2bf939b9cb2bec6\">[email&#xA0;protected]</a>)\r\nBITRATE.......: 5000 Kbps (2-pass)\r\nRESOLUTION....: 1920x1080\r\nASPECT RATIO..: 1.85:1\r\nFRAMERATE.....: 23.976 fps\r\nAUDIO.........: English AAC 1.0 192kbps VBR\r\nSUBTITLES.....: ENG\r\nCHAPTERS......: Yes\r\nSOURCE........: The.Killing.of.a.Chinese.Bookie.1978.Cut.CC.BDRemux\r\nENCODED BY....: Sartre\r\nENCODE DATE...: 2017-12-23","last_updated":"2017-12-26T12:04:17.854Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:cfc672ae6a151001161e068177feba220862021b","dn":"The.Killing.of.a.Chinese.Bookie.1976.Criterion.1080p.HEVC-SARTRE","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"cfc672ae6a151001161e068177feba220862021b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,198,114,174,106,21,16,1,22,30,6,129,119,254,186,34,8,98,2,27]},"name":"The.Killing.of.a.Chinese.Bookie.1976.Criterion.1080p.HEVC-SARTRE","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
