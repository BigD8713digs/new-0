Jack coughed, then coughed again, clinging to the pain searing his throat, an anchor against a different pain, one he could never articulate.\r\n\r\nSomething wriggled inside his cape. He glanced down at the miniature dog, Spiffy. They hadn&#x2019;t been able to find the tunnel to the surface until it had jumped out of the cape and scampered up behind a rock fall. The animal had saved them, but it might have only delayed the inevitable. Jack reached in, unconsciously reassuring it with a gentle pat, feeling its warm life against his hand. &#x201C;Our friendly neighborhood volcano decided to erupt all over the Stargate.&#x201D; He swallowed the grit in his mouth and stood.\r\n\r\nDaniel&#x2019;s eyes opened wide in disbelief. &#x201C;What about Sam and the other kids?&#x201D;\r\n\r\n&#x201C;They&#x2019;re dead.&#x201D; Jack&#x2019;s voice was as cracked and brittle as the cinders that covered the ground. &#x201C;They&#x2019;re all dead.&#x201D;\r\n\r\n\r\nOfficial AnonCrypt accounts: <a href=\"\nhttps://1337x.to/user/AnonCrypt/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://1337x.to/user/AnonCrypt/</a> <a href=\"\nhttps://thepiratebay.org/user/AnonCrypt/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://thepiratebay.org/user/AnonCrypt/</a> <a href=\"\nhttps://katcr.co/user/AnonCrypt/profile/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://katcr.co/user/AnonCrypt/profile/</a> <a href=\"\nhttps://www.torrentfunk.com/user/anoncrypt.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://www.torrentfunk.com/user/anoncrypt.html</a>\r\n\r\n\r\n- Please see our newest torrents for an updated list","last_updated":"2018-07-03T12:07:18.733Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:f388b5756f7e236f5e45b115f3764ada35a0f394","dn":"Stargate SG-1 - City of the Gods - SG1-04 - Fandemonium Ltd (200","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"f388b5756f7e236f5e45b115f3764ada35a0f394","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,136,181,117,111,126,35,111,94,69,177,21,243,118,74,218,53,160,243,148]},"name":"Stargate SG-1 - City of the Gods - SG1-04 - Fandemonium Ltd (200","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
