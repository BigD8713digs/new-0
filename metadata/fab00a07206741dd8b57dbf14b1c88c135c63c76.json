The program allows you to fine-tune all sorts of filters in order to separate traffic on the necessary ports and even IP addresses. If we consider the interface, then it is quite convenient, the settings are not so much and as it may seem initially, it is possible to understand.After you configure the filters, BWMeter will show a separate graph for each of them, if there are several computers on your network, then if you configure the program, you can also view the traffic of each computer. The graph itself can show traffic in a minute, a week, a month and a year, respectively, which is quite convenient.Of the features worth noting support for BWMeter traffic mapping in both the numerical version and the graphic, which is presented in my screenshot. The main advantages of the program I already identified, the ability to share traffic to the local and the Internet, you can monitor an unlimited number of network connections, there is support for various types of connection to the Internet, detailed statistics and so on. I hope BWMeter comes in handy and will perform its role properly. \r\n\r\nDeveloper: DeskSoft \r\nLicense: ShareWare \r\nLanguage: English \r\nSize: 1 MB \r\nOS: Windows \r\n\r\nHow to Install: \r\n1).
