Lost in thought, he looks out of the window and sees a man strangle a woman in the apartment across the street.\r\n\r\nProfessor Andersen fails to report the crime. The days pass, and he becomes paralysed by indecision. Desperate for respite, the professor sets off to a local sushi bar, only to find himself face to face with the murderer.\r\n\r\nProfessor Andersen&apos;s Night is an unsettling yet highly entertaining novel of apathy, rebellion and morality. In flinty prose, Solstad presents an uncomfortable question: would we, like his cerebral protagonist, do nothing?\r\n\r\nGenre: Fiction &gt; Literary &amp; Contemporary","last_updated":"2018-11-03T12:28:47.110Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:a813ebc01a67b4f36df7706a8823d8b71f429eb4","dn":"Professor Andersen's Night by Dag Solstad (.epub)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"a813ebc01a67b4f36df7706a8823d8b71f429eb4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,19,235,192,26,103,180,243,109,247,112,106,136,35,216,183,31,66,158,180]},"name":"Professor Andersen's Night by Dag Solstad (.epub)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
