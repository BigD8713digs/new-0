It will happen again. We must be ready. \r\n\r\nSober words from Dr. Sebastian Gorka, a man who has made the unvarnished truth his specialty. And there&apos;s one eternal truth that Americans are in danger of forgetting: the most important weapon in any geopolitical conflict is the will to win. \r\n\r\nAnd we must win. \r\n\r\nIn this powerful manifesto, Dr. Gorka explains the basic principles that have guided strategists since Sun Tzu penned The Art of War in the sixth century B.C. To defeat your enemy, you must know him. But that&apos;s the last thing liberal elites are interested in. Willful ignorance about our adversary&#x2014;whether it&apos;s Russia, China, or the global jihadi movement&#x2014;has been crippling. Tearing off America&apos;s politically correct blindfold, Dr. Gorka clarifies who our foes are and what makes them tick.\r\n\r\nGenre: Non-Fiction &gt; General","last_updated":"2018-10-11T12:14:42.681Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:0721b53a011a742b91034c9ea97f85920f2b918f","dn":"Why We Fight by Sebastian Gorka (.epub)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"0721b53a011a742b91034c9ea97f85920f2b918f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,33,181,58,1,26,116,43,145,3,76,158,169,127,133,146,15,43,145,143]},"name":"Why We Fight by Sebastian Gorka (.epub)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
