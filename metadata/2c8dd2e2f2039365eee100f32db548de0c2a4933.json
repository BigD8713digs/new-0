Compiled by the flotilla commander, the war diary was a formal record that included combat results. From laying mines along Britain&apos;s eastern seaboard to the desperate final battles, the roller-coaster fortunes of Karl D&#xF6;nitz&apos;s &quot;Grey Wolves&quot; are recorded in detail.\r\n\r\nWar diary entries include the commencement ofthe first clashes, the Battle of the Atlantic, and much more. Appendixes detail the U-boat types of the first flotilla and German submarine development between the wars. Both U-boat enthusiasts and those with a taste for adventure will be engrossed by the skilled narrative that captures the immediacy of the day-to-day high-risk operations.\r\n\r\nHardcover: 320 pages\r\nPublisher: Naval Institute Press; First American edition (April 1, 2002)","last_updated":"2018-01-01T12:04:24.340Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c8dd2e2f2039365eee100f32db548de0c2a4933","dn":"The First U-Boat Flotilla","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"2c8dd2e2f2039365eee100f32db548de0c2a4933","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,141,210,226,242,3,147,101,238,225,0,243,45,181,72,222,12,42,73,51]},"name":"The First U-Boat Flotilla","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
