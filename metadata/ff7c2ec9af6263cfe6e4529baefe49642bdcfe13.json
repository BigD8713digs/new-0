When a man dies, the undertaker comes for the body, and the dealer comes for the rest. I deal in dead men&apos;s clocks, pipes and swords. Passing through my hands, they give off joy, loneliness, fear...I have known more evil in a set of false teeth than in any so-called haunted house in England.&quot;\r\n\r\nSo speaks Geoff Ashden, a regular guy trying to make an honest living as an antique dealer, but who has an uncanny knack for finding cursed objects and haunted places: a sinister Georgian clock carved with obscene and satanic designs, a hideous doll with deadly powers, a pair of old spectacles that let their wearer see a little too clearly, an ugly house with a terrifying secret, a church full of graffiti scrawled in decomposing human flesh. In this collection, award-winning children&apos;s author Robert Westall delivers a set of chilling tales for adults and proves himself, as Orrin Grey writes in the new introduction to this edition, &quot;an obvious successor to that godfather of the English ghost story, M.R. James.&quot;\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-06-03T12:11:06.571Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff7c2ec9af6263cfe6e4529baefe49642bdcfe13","dn":"Antique Dust: Ghost Stories by Robert Westall AZW","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"ff7c2ec9af6263cfe6e4529baefe49642bdcfe13","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,124,46,201,175,98,99,207,230,228,82,155,174,254,73,100,43,220,254,19]},"name":"Antique Dust: Ghost Stories by Robert Westall AZW","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
