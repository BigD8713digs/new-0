The most common explanations cite the West&#x2019;s superior geography, commerce, and technology. Completely overlooked is the fact that faith in reason, rooted in Christianity&#x2019;s commitment to rational theology, made all these developments possible. Simply put, the conventional wisdom that Western success depended upon overcoming religious barriers to progress is utter nonsense. \r\n\r\nIn The Victory of Reason, Rodney Stark advances a revolutionary, controversial, and long overdue idea: that Christianity and its related institutions are, in fact, directly responsible for the most significant intellectual, political, scientific, and economic breakthroughs of the past millennium","last_updated":"2018-08-22T12:01:57.554Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d0b1aa69c6eacfaf4fa25b02d794f202fef6bb8","dn":"The Victory of Reason by Rodney Stark (.epub)(.pdf)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"1d0b1aa69c6eacfaf4fa25b02d794f202fef6bb8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,11,26,166,156,110,172,250,244,250,37,176,45,121,79,32,47,239,107,184]},"name":"The Victory of Reason by Rodney Stark (.epub)(.pdf)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
