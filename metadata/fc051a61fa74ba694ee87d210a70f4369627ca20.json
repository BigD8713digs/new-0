Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson - plunge into the mental illness that would culminate in his suicide. And here is the widow who shook off her grief and insecurity to take on a president and a pressman&#x2019;s union as she entered the profane boys&#x2019; club of the newspaper business.\r\n\r\nAs timely now as ever, Personal History is an exemplary record of our history and of the woman who played such a shaping role within them, discovering her own strength and sense of self as she confronted - and mastered - the personal and professional crises of her fascinating life.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-01-26T12:00:52.874Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc051a61fa74ba694ee87d210a70f4369627ca20","dn":"Personal History by Katharine Graham MOBI","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"fc051a61fa74ba694ee87d210a70f4369627ca20","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,5,26,97,250,116,186,105,78,232,125,33,10,112,244,54,150,39,202,32]},"name":"Personal History by Katharine Graham MOBI","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
