Achieve excellence and be better than you&apos;ve ever been!\r\n\r\nIn his years as a professional ice-skater, Olympic Gold Medalist Scott Hamilton learned to embrace the mind-set of working hard to &quot;beat&quot; the competition. But it seems competition has gotten a bad rap these days. We&apos;ve bought in to the belief that it is unfair to participants to rank performance. Yet competition is in fact a good thing because it&apos;s about working toward excellence.\r\n\r\nFinish First is a wake-up call for business leaders, entrepreneurs, spouses, parents, and even students to stop settling for mediocre and begin to revitalize their intrinsic will to achieve excellence and go for the win. Most of us feel we were made for something more, but we&apos;re often afraid to allow ourselves to be competitive because we think our finishing first might somehow rob others of their chance to shine. This book encourages the hidden potential, the champion within all of us, to come out - which eventually brings our families, our marriages, our careers, our businesses, and the world around us the greatest possible good.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-05-21T12:01:14.407Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:13032bee5ccfa4691b07fbbf50713ae3f5b3da72","dn":"Finish First by Scott Hamilton EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"13032bee5ccfa4691b07fbbf50713ae3f5b3da72","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,3,43,238,92,207,164,105,27,7,251,191,80,113,58,227,245,179,218,114]},"name":"Finish First by Scott Hamilton EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
