More conversations followed over the next four decades of friendship, and it was only after Joni and Malka completed their last recorded interview, in 2012, that Malka discovered the heart of their discussions: the creative process.\r\n\r\nIn Joni Mitchell: In Her Own Words, Joni and Malka follow this thread through seven decades of life and art, discussing the influence of Joni&apos;s childhood, love and loss, playing dives and huge festivals, acclaim and criticism, poverty and affluence, glamorous triumphs and tragic mistakes.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-12-24T12:00:32.654Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:9327fca88131c93e68842d7230abcd673ca45ea9","dn":"Joni Mitchell_ In Her Own Words by Malka Marom EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"9327fca88131c93e68842d7230abcd673ca45ea9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,39,252,168,129,49,201,62,104,132,45,114,48,171,205,103,60,164,94,169]},"name":"Joni Mitchell_ In Her Own Words by Malka Marom EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
