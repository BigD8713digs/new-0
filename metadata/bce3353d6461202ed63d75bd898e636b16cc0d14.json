His lectures were mechanical; his relationships were little more than ways to fill the evenings. But as his journey veered dangerously off course, everything about him began to change.\r\n\r\nA gripping adventure of the body and mind, To the Last Breath depicts the quest that leads Slakey around the globe, almost takes his life, challenges his fiercely held beliefs, and opens his heart. The scientist in Slakey explores the history of Robert Falcon Scott&#x2019;s doomed Antarctica expedition, the technology of climbing, and the geophysics of waves. But it is the challenges he endures and the people he encounters - a Lama who gives him a mysterious amulet, a life-or-death choice atop Everest, an ambush at gunpoint in Indonesia, a head-on collision in the high desert - that culminate in a moving lesson about what it means to be human.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-01-30T12:10:36.147Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:bce3353d6461202ed63d75bd898e636b16cc0d14","dn":"To the Last Breath by Francis Slakey EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"bce3353d6461202ed63d75bd898e636b16cc0d14","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,227,53,61,100,97,32,46,214,61,117,189,137,142,99,107,22,204,13,20]},"name":"To the Last Breath by Francis Slakey EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
