From the curious life of patriarch Robert Kardashian, whose family meatpacking business was tainted by scandal, to &quot;momager&quot; Kris Jenner&apos;s top-secret plan for the future, The Kardashians reveals the untold, definitive story based on two years of investigative reporting and scores of candid, on-the-record interviews, ranging from childhood friends to powerful business associates, who break their silence for the first time. \r\n\r\nIn the decade since the Kardashians first appeared on the scene, millions of speculative words have been written about their drama-filled lives. But most has been tabloid hype and gossip column fantasy. Until now. \r\n\r\nOppenheimer has authored revelatory books on such international icons as the Clintons, the Kennedys, the Hiltons, and more. Now comes The Kardashians, the true story that will make headlines and shock even the most loyal fans. \r\n\r\nThis book will make readers gasp, cringe, and take to social media. \r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-09-20T12:00:46.520Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:c47097d70baabe46ead0c851ea6608a98fce9131","dn":"The Kardashians_ An American Drama by Jerry Oppenheimer ePUB eBO","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"c47097d70baabe46ead0c851ea6608a98fce9131","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,112,151,215,11,170,190,70,234,208,200,81,234,102,8,169,143,206,145,49]},"name":"The Kardashians_ An American Drama by Jerry Oppenheimer ePUB eBO","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
