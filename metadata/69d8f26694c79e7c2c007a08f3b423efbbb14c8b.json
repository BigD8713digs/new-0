This phase of \r\nhis story begins in 1963, when, as a Ph.D. candidate in Physics, he is enjoying all \r\nthat life at Cambridge has to offer. Beyond his studies, that enjoyment of life \r\nprimarily entails a relationship with a liberal arts student named Jane Wilde. His \r\nlife takes a major turn when he is diagnosed with Lou Gehrig&apos;s Disease, which will \r\nultimately kill him, the expectation within two years, as all his voluntary motor \r\nfunctions - including his ability to speak, swallow and therefore eat, and breathe \r\nwill fail. Against his initial want for Jane to leave him, she stands by his side \r\nultimately to become Jane Hawking. The diagnosis places time constraints on what he \r\nwants to accomplish, completing his Ph.D. dissertation on a revolutionary idea on \r\nthe creation of the universe chief among them. But as the effects of the disease \r\nprogress more slowly than anticipated, he and Jane begin to think more holistically \r\nabout his life, including furthering his work to probe into developing a theory \r\nbehind how everything in the universe operates. Jane is by Stephen&apos;s side doing \r\nwhatever she can to make his life more holistically fulfilling, but she also cannot \r\ndo this alone nor does she want solely to be known as Stephen&apos;s caregiver without a \r\nlife or identity of her own.\r\n\r\nInfo.\r\n=&gt;-Release Date : 2014.\r\n=&gt;-Language : English : Italian.\r\n=&gt;-File Size : 3.76 GiB.\r\n=&gt;-Overall bit rate : 4 361 kbps.\r\n=&gt;-Movie Runtime : 2h 03m.\r\n\r\nVideo.\r\n=&gt;-Codec : H.264/MPEG-4 AVC.\r\n=&gt;-Aspect Ratio : 2.40:1.\r\n=&gt;-Resolution : 1 920 x 800.\r\n=&gt;-Bit rate : 3 444 kbps.\r\n\r\nAudio 1 English.\r\n=&gt;-Codec : mp4a: MPEG-4 AAC LC.\r\n=&gt;-Channels : 2 channels.\r\n=&gt;-Bit Rate : 128 kbps.\r\n=&gt;-Maximum bit rate : 246 kbps.\r\n\r\nAudio 2 English.\r\n=&gt;-Codec : Digital Audio Compression AC-3.\r\n=&gt;-Channels : 6 channels-Front L C R, Side: L R, LFE.\r\n=&gt;-Bit Rate : 640 kbps.\r\n=&gt;-Bit rate mode : Constant.\r\n\r\nAudio 3 Italian.\r\n=&gt;-Codec : mp4a: MPEG-4 AAC LC.\r\n=&gt;-Channels : 2 channels.\r\n=&gt;-Bit Rate : 128 kbps.\r\n=&gt;-Maximum bit rate : 247 kbps","last_updated":"2018-10-31T12:04:01.249Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:69d8f26694c79e7c2c007a08f3b423efbbb14c8b","dn":"The Theory Of Everything - Stephen Hawking 2014 Eng Ita 720p","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"69d8f26694c79e7c2c007a08f3b423efbbb14c8b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,216,242,102,148,199,158,124,44,0,122,8,243,180,35,239,187,177,76,139]},"name":"The Theory Of Everything - Stephen Hawking 2014 Eng Ita 720p","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
