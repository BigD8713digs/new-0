Suleyman became besotted with her and foreswore all other concubines. Then, in an unprecedented step, he freed her and married her. The bold and canny Roxelana soon became a shrewd diplomat and philanthropist, who helped Suleyman keep pace with a changing world in which women, from Isabella of Hungary to Catherine de Medici, increasingly held the reins of power.\r\n\r\nUntil now Roxelana has been seen as a seductress who brought ruin to the empire, but in Empress of the East, Peirce reveals the true history of an elusive figure who transformed the Ottoman harem into an institution of imperial rule.\r\n\r\nHardcover: 368 pages\r\nPublisher: Basic Books; 1st edition (September 19, 2017)","last_updated":"2017-12-13T12:00:28.373Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d13bd384f48d8cb947a7365e04123d3da013214","dn":"Empress of the East: How a European Slave Girl Became Queen...","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"1d13bd384f48d8cb947a7365e04123d3da013214","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,19,189,56,79,72,216,203,148,122,115,101,224,65,35,211,218,1,50,20]},"name":"Empress of the East: How a European Slave Girl Became Queen...","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
