Universe Sandbox &#xB2; is the long awaited sequel to the original Universe Sandbox.Universe Sandbox &#xB2; includes the desktop version and a new VR mode with support for the HTC Vive. This is a free, automatic update.Simulate GravityN-body simulation at almost any speed using Newtonian mechanics. Real science, real physics, no supercomputer required.

Or move the Earth farther from the Sun and freeze the entire planet. Learn more...Terraform PlanetsAdd carbon dioxide to a planet&apos;s atmosphere to heat it up. Then add water...Deform SurfacesImpact planets with asteroids and comets and leave behind massive, molten craters.Supernova a StarMake a star evolve by cranking up its age or mass, then watch a supernova unfold.And more...Material System - build planets out of Hydrogen, Iron, Rock, &amp; WaterSolar flares &amp; volatile trailsProcedurally generated stars &amp; planetsPulsarsLight-warping black holesDark matter","last_updated":"2017-07-22T12:00:54.502Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca6a78de102eb6815e5402223276d2e299010ce2","dn":"Universe Sandbox 2 v20.0.11","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"ca6a78de102eb6815e5402223276d2e299010ce2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,106,120,222,16,46,182,129,94,84,2,34,50,118,210,226,153,1,12,226]},"name":"Universe Sandbox 2 v20.0.11","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
