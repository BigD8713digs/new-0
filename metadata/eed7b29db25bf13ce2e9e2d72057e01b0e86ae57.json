For Song for Donise, he gathered his colleagues from Payton&apos;s quintet -- Payton, tenor saxophonist Tim Warfield, pianist Anthony Wonsey, and bassist Reuben Rogers -- to perform five post-bop originals, two standards, and one jazz classic, Miles Davis and Wayne Shorter&apos;s &quot;ESP,&quot; played at an incredibly fast tempo. As this is a working band that has toured regularly and has recorded under Payton&apos;s name on Verve, the group&apos;s sound becomes the recording&apos;s focus, although the feel seems looser and more energetic than on Payton&apos;s recordings, best exemplified by the interplay between Payton and Warfield on &quot;Dia&apos;s Blues,&quot; an up-tempo number on which Payton and Warfield play different melodies and solo collectively. Other highlights include Wonsey&apos;s &quot;Seventy Ninth Street,&quot; an up-tempo swinger built on some well-placed drum hits on which Wonsey quotes Leon Parker&apos;s &quot;B.B.B.B&quot; during his solo, and the Shorter-ish &quot;Reflections,&quot; also written by Wonsey. This is a very good debut from a fine young musician. - Greg Turner, AMG","last_updated":"2017-07-30T12:03:57.557Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:eed7b29db25bf13ce2e9e2d72057e01b0e86ae57","dn":"Adonis Rose Quintet 1997 Song For Donise","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"eed7b29db25bf13ce2e9e2d72057e01b0e86ae57","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,215,178,157,178,91,241,60,226,233,226,215,32,87,224,27,14,134,174,87]},"name":"Adonis Rose Quintet 1997 Song For Donise","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
