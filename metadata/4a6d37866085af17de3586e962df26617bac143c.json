This does not mean this is the final build as They are not done yet. We&#x2019;re just now beginning the phase of checking in final code to prepare for the final release. The only difference between this build and Build 17127 from Tuesday is the removal of the watermark. However, we&#x2019;ve got more fixes being checked in for the next flight. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, They have also released Build 17127 to Windows Insiders in the Slow ring. They plan to provide the ISO for this build early next week. \r\n\r\nIntroducing Cortana Show Me \r\nEver wanted to change a setting, but didn&#x2019;t know how? Enter Cortana Show Me, your guide to Windows 10 settings, which is now available for download in the Microsoft Store through this link. In our preview app, Cortana will show you how to change settings step-by-step. In this release, you can launch guides directly from the app homepage, but check back soon for voice entry points. For Insiders, the app is available in English (US and UK) and in German. We&#x2019;ve created guides for 15 settings so far but stay tuned for further improvements and additional offerings. While They know this experience isn&#x2019;t specifically designed for Insiders, it&#x2019;s for all the friends and family They have who need a pointer &#x2013; please share it with them. \r\n\r\nIf you click the link in Store and can&#x2019;t download the app, wait a few hours and give it another try. It&#x2019;s still rolling out! \r\n\r\nNote: If you&#x2019;re using keyboard navigation with your device, you will need to use Alt + T ab to move between Settings and Cortana Show Me","last_updated":"2018-03-24T12:02:00.916Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:4a6d37866085af17de3586e962df26617bac143c","dn":"Windows 10 RS4 Build 17128 All In One (x86/x64) ISO","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"4a6d37866085af17de3586e962df26617bac143c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,109,55,134,96,133,175,23,222,53,134,233,98,223,38,97,123,172,20,60]},"name":"Windows 10 RS4 Build 17128 All In One (x86/x64) ISO","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
