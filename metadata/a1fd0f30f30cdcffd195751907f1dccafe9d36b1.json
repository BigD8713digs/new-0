But in the aftermath, the country descended into bitter rivalries and civil war, paving the way for the Islamic State and a catastrophic migrant crisis.\r\n\r\nIn a fast-paced narrative that blends frontline reporting, analysis, and history, Frederic Wehrey tells the story of what went wrong. An Arabic-speaking Middle East scholar, Wehrey interviewed the key actors in Libya and paints vivid portraits of lives upended by a country in turmoil: the once-hopeful activists murdered or exiled, revolutionaries transformed into militia bosses or jihadist recruits, an aging general who promises salvation from the chaos in exchange for a return to the old authoritarianism. He traveled where few or no Western journalists have gone, from the shattered city of Benghazi, birthplace of the revolution, to the lawless Sahara, to the coastal stronghold of the Islamic State in Qadhafi&apos;s hometown of Sirte. He chronicles the American and international missteps after the dictator&apos;s death that led to the country&apos;s unraveling.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-05-02T12:00:44.865Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1fd0f30f30cdcffd195751907f1dccafe9d36b1","dn":"The Burning Shores by Frederic Wehrey EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"a1fd0f30f30cdcffd195751907f1dccafe9d36b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,253,15,48,243,12,220,255,209,149,117,25,7,241,220,202,254,157,54,177]},"name":"The Burning Shores by Frederic Wehrey EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
