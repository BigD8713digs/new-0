It is worth noting that the developer of the product home, that should already make us proud, the popularity of the player scored very high, and in a short time, the full story, you can download of AIMP  .\r\nDue to the fact that the player offers a huge number of functions, which are all connected in a pleasant interface, it is in demand among the majority of users. You can listen to a large number of audio formats, work with different formats, playlists, you will also have the opportunity to change the appearance of AIMP, the skins can be downloaded from the official website and from third-party developers.\r\nI note that this version is based on its own engine, previously was used the BASS, it also continues to be used here, but as a decoder, so there you have it. The authors of the program say that it is thanks to this engine they were able to greatly upgrade AIMP further. You will be able to supplement the program of plug-ins, burn audio CDs, convert music formats, in every possible way to work with playlists and create them, use the Scheduler, set up a great equalizer, and so on.\r\nI forgot to add, of course, you can edit tags, and to do this it will be possible in batch mode. Generally AIMP has a lot of awards, I would say that this most ardent rival Winamp, which I stopped after like the second version, too many unnecessary for me to note, this is only my opinion, I do not impose anything on anyone. In general I can recommend AIMP as a major player, I think it can meet the needs of many users","last_updated":"2017-10-20T12:04:40.633Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e3cf5f7cf43706dc09a1741b20df95f10ad4d8a","dn":"AIMP 4.50 RC 2 build 2037 Multilingual Portable","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"6e3cf5f7cf43706dc09a1741b20df95f10ad4d8a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,60,245,247,207,67,112,109,192,154,23,65,178,13,249,95,16,173,77,138]},"name":"AIMP 4.50 RC 2 build 2037 Multilingual Portable","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
