And yes, sometimes that includes fart jokes. In this candid and uproarious book, Farsad shares her personal experiences growing up as the &quot;other&quot; in an American culture that has no time for nuance. In fact she longed to be black and/or Mexican at various points of her youth - you know, like normal kids. Right? Right?\r\n\r\nWriting bluntly and hilariously about the elements of race we are often too politically correct to discuss, Farsad takes a long, hard look at the iconography that still shapes our concepts of &quot;black&quot;, &quot;white&quot;, and &quot;Muslim&quot; today - and what it means when white culture defines the culture. Farsad asks the important questions, like, &quot;What does it mean to have a hyphenated identity?&quot;, &quot;How can we actually combat racism, stereotyping, and exclusion?&quot;, and &quot;Do Iranians get bunions at a higher rate than other ethnic groups?&quot; (She&apos;s asking for a friend.)\r\n\r\nHow to Make White People Laugh tackles these questions with wit, humor, and incisive intellect. And along the way, you might just learn a thing or two about tetherball, Duck Dynasty, and wine slushies.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-12-01T12:02:47.459Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f5e35c20a7b3b955555585253edd5626bca8cad","dn":"How to Make White People Laugh by Negin Farsad EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"7f5e35c20a7b3b955555585253edd5626bca8cad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,94,53,194,10,123,59,149,85,85,88,82,83,237,213,98,107,202,140,173]},"name":"How to Make White People Laugh by Negin Farsad EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
