Based on Bukowski&apos;s experiences when working on the film Barfly, the absurdity and egotism of the film industry are laid bare in this deadpan, touching, and funny glimpse into the endless negotiations and back-stabbings of la-la land. Hollywood is an irreverent jaunt that serves up the beating heart of Hollywood with razor-sharp humour.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-07-10T12:00:52.501Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:827d53f75a1e5a012963d7915ba70672ffba9c9a","dn":"Hollywood by Charles Bukowski epub RtR","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"827d53f75a1e5a012963d7915ba70672ffba9c9a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,125,83,247,90,30,90,1,41,99,215,145,91,167,6,114,255,186,156,154]},"name":"Hollywood by Charles Bukowski epub RtR","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
