Since then, the stand has been owned and managed exclusively by local girls, who inevitably become the best of friends.\r\n\r\nSeventeen-year-old Amelia and her best friend, Cate, have worked at the stand every summer for the past three years, and Amelia is &quot;Head Girl&quot; at the stand this summer. When Molly passes away before Amelia even has her first day in charge, Amelia isn&apos;t sure that the stand can go on. That is, until Molly&apos;s grandnephew Grady arrives and asks Amelia to stay on to help continue the business...but Grady&apos;s got some changes in mind.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-06-01T12:00:47.908Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e8d3ce3aa16f8419acdf7defacf7b5a494b2464","dn":"Stay Sweet by Siobhan Vivian EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"9e8d3ce3aa16f8419acdf7defacf7b5a494b2464","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,141,60,227,170,22,248,65,154,205,247,222,250,207,123,90,73,75,36,100]},"name":"Stay Sweet by Siobhan Vivian EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
