Haksar (Translator)\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most lively and exuberant of Kalidasa&apos;s extant works, Ritusamharam is a glorious ode to nature&apos;s bounty and the enduring emotional response it evokes in mankind as a whole.\r\n\r\nRecounted as a celebration of the passing seasons, it is a feast for the senses, capturing the myriad facets of love and longing in a kaleidoscope of sumptuous imagery: the mischievous moonlight that, like a pining lover, steals glances at sleeping maidens; the monsoon-bloated rivers that rush to the sea with a lustful urgency; the flame of lovemaking that is kindled anew at the onset of winter; the heady scent of mango blossoms that makes even the most unyielding of hearts quiver. Even animals, big and small, are swept into the playful pattern of the great poet&apos;s lyrical homage.\r\n\r\nA.N.D. Haksar&apos;s supple and spirited translation is accompanied by an absorbing introduction and notes that shed further light on this extraordinary work.\r\n\r\nHardcover: 176 pages\r\nPublisher: Penguin Classics (12 April 2018)\r\nLanguage: English\r\nISBN-10: 0670089559\r\n <a href=\"\nhttps://www.amazon.in/Ritusamharam-Kalidasa/dp/0670089559/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://www.amazon.in/Ritusamharam-Kalidasa/dp/0670089559/</a>","last_updated":"2018-07-04T12:10:35.224Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:43c7ff84512b5e1d81ec5ba43c12cec7aac4951e","dn":"Kalidasa - Ritusamharam: A Gathering of Seasons - 2018 [Poetry]","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"43c7ff84512b5e1d81ec5ba43c12cec7aac4951e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,199,255,132,81,43,94,29,129,236,91,164,60,18,206,199,170,196,149,30]},"name":"Kalidasa - Ritusamharam: A Gathering of Seasons - 2018 [Poetry]","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
