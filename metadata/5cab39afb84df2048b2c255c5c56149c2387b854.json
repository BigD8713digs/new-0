Gillespie liked the big-band style in which he had made his name, and here we find groups of more than twelve pieces handling Gillespie&apos;s and other composers&apos; most challenging bop compositions... \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBebop marks the transition between swing and progressive jazz following World War II and includes the origins of Latin jazz. Dizzy Gillespie was among the revolutionaries of the transition. \r\nThis album is a 24-track, 72-minute collection of his recordings between 1946 and 1949. Retrospectively, they are extraordinary milestones: powerful, pioneering, and portentous. Here are his great hits--52nd Street Theme, Night in Tunisia, Manteca and other Afro-Cuban tunes of congo and bongo drumming. We hear in his bands Milt Jackson, Ray Brown, James Moody, John Lewis, Kenny Clarke, Chano Pozo, and Yusef Lateef, among other stars. \r\nYou certainly get your money&apos;s worth. This album is an excellent historical addition to your jazz collection.
