It is April 1964 and one week before Hitler&apos;s 75th birthday. Xavier March, a detective of the Kriminalpolizei, is called out to investigate the discovery of a dead body in a lake near Berlin&apos;s most prestigious suburb.\r\n\r\nAs March discovers the identity of the body, he uncovers signs of a conspiracy that could go to the very top of the German Reich.
