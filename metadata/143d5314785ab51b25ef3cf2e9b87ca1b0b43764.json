A white flour bag encased the little body. Three small faces watched from the window, eyes black with terror. \r\nThe child in the middle spoke without turning his head. &#x2018;I wonder which one of us will be next?&#x2019; \r\nWhen a woman&#x2019;s body is discovered in a cathedral and hours later a young man is found hanging from a tree outside his home, Detective Lottie Parker is called in to lead the investigation. Both bodies have the same distinctive tattoo clumsily inscribed on their legs. It&#x2019;s clear the pair are connected, but how? \r\nThe trail leads Lottie to St Angela&#x2019;s, a former children&#x2019;s home, with a dark connection to her own family history. Suddenly the case just got personal. \r\nAs Lottie begins to link the current victims to unsolved murders decades old, two teenage boys go missing. She must close in on the killer before they strike again, but in doing so is she putting her own children in terrifying danger? \r\nLottie is about to come face to face with a twisted soul who has a very warped idea of justice","last_updated":"2017-08-04T12:01:29.908Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:143d5314785ab51b25ef3cf2e9b87ca1b0b43764","dn":"The Missing Ones ~ Patricia Gibney [Shades]epub","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"143d5314785ab51b25ef3cf2e9b87ca1b0b43764","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,61,83,20,120,90,181,27,37,239,60,242,233,184,124,161,176,180,55,100]},"name":"The Missing Ones ~ Patricia Gibney [Shades]epub","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
