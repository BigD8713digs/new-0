But there are secrets afflicting Freya&#x2019;s family, some more sinister than others, that could destroy their relationship before it has a chance to flourish.\r\n\r\nWhile Freya&#x2019;s older children are less than welcoming, six-year-old Sophie helps Duncan find his place in the family - but even Sophie harbours fears that threaten to overshadow any chance of a new start. The past is hard to leave behind when pictures of Freya&#x2019;s idolised late husband hang in every room, and the more Duncan tries to find the source of Sophie&#x2019;s anxiety, the more he is convinced that Reuben was not the perfect husband and father Freya remembers.\r\n\r\nTormented by concern and his own insecurity, Duncan begins an obsessive investigation into the dead man&#x2019;s past. But when his good intentions lead him in too deep, he risks destroying everything he has built with Freya - and the whole family&#x2019;s second chance at happiness.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-06-06T12:03:34.407Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:73756e878c0ab3d88bee0849c3b4caa070fd52a1","dn":"Lark Song by Jane Bailey EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"73756e878c0ab3d88bee0849c3b4caa070fd52a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,117,110,135,140,10,179,216,139,238,8,73,195,180,202,160,112,253,82,161]},"name":"Lark Song by Jane Bailey EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
