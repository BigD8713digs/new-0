He is a young executive, and she is an artist on the brink of an exciting career. But as they settle into the routine of their life together, they are ripped apart by circumstances neither could have imagined. Roy is arrested and sentenced to 12 years for a crime Celestial knows he didn&apos;t commit. \r\n\r\nThough fiercely independent, Celestial finds herself bereft and unmoored, taking comfort in Andre, her childhood friend, and best man at their wedding. As Roy&apos;s time in prison passes, she is unable to hold on to the love that has been her center. After five years, Roy&apos;s conviction is suddenly overturned, and he returns to Atlanta ready to resume their life together. \r\n\r\nThis stirring love story is a profoundly insightful look into the hearts and minds of three people who are at once bound and separated by forces beyond their control. An American Marriage is a masterpiece of storytelling, an intimate look deep into the souls of people who must reckon with the past while moving forward - with hope and pain - into the future. \r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-02-08T12:07:04.172Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ff1a5cfdb6dcdad6bd07679e73e443c110c61ff","dn":"An American Marriage by Tayari Jones EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"6ff1a5cfdb6dcdad6bd07679e73e443c110c61ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,241,165,207,219,109,205,173,107,208,118,121,231,62,68,60,17,12,97,255]},"name":"An American Marriage by Tayari Jones EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
