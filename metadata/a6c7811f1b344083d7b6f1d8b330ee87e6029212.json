Yates EPUB\r\n\r\nThe highly anticipated new book from the author whose debut was called &quot;The smart summer thriller you&apos;ve been waiting for...&quot; (NPR&apos;s All Things Considered) and was named a Book of the Year by NPR and an Entertainment Weekly Must-List Pick\r\n\r\nChristopher J. Yates&apos; cult hit Black Chalk introduced that rare writerly talent: a literary author who could create a plot with the intricacy of a brilliant mental puzzle and with characters so absorbing that readers are immediately gripped. Yates&apos; new book does not disappoint.\r\n\r\nGrist Mill Road is a dark, twisted, and expertly plotted Rashomon-style tale. The year is 1982; the setting an Edenic hamlet some 90 miles north of New York City. There, among the craggy rock cliffs and glacial ponds of timeworn mountains, three friends - Patrick, Matthew, and Hannah - are bound together by a terrible and seemingly senseless crime. Twenty-six years later, in New York City, living lives their younger selves never could have predicted, the three meet again - with even more devastating results.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-01-18T18:58:42.582Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:a6c7811f1b344083d7b6f1d8b330ee87e6029212","dn":"Grist Mill Road by Christopher J.
