How many people today know about Britain&apos;s deep involvement in the opium drug trade in China, or that Tony Blair&apos;s hero Gladstone devoted his maiden parliamentary speech to defending his family&apos;s slave plantation in Jamaica?\r\n\r\nJohn Newsinger has written a wonderful popular history of key episodes in British imperial history. He pays particular attention to the battles of the colonised to free themselves of its baleful rule, including Rebellion in Jamaica; The Irish Famine; The Opium Wars; The Great Indian Rebellion; The Conquest of Egypt; Palestine in Revolt; &apos;Quit India&apos; and the struggle for Independence; Suez; Malaya; Kenya and Rhodesia; and, Britain and American Imperialism.\r\n\r\nHardcover, 286 pages\r\nPublished May 1st 2010 by Trentham Books","last_updated":"2017-12-30T12:00:25.095Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:e444f5d65577c1975bc764bfd55fe1f902b94070","dn":"The Blood Never Dried: A People's History of the British Empire","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"e444f5d65577c1975bc764bfd55fe1f902b94070","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,68,245,214,85,119,193,151,91,199,100,191,213,95,225,249,2,185,64,112]},"name":"The Blood Never Dried: A People's History of the British Empire","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
