And the sleepy hamlet of Train Line, New York, nestled against a frigid lake in the westernmost fringes of the state, was founded on, built, and is still sustained by it. Now a young woman and a practicing medium herself, Naomi still lives in the place that nourished and raised her - the place where she fell in love.\r\n\r\nLove, however, can be deadly. And the secrets behind the fake and the fraud, behind her deepest desires and greatest fears, and behind the lies and truths of her life collide with ferocity and quiet consequence, a profound duality that pervades the past and the present, and crosses the line between the living and the dead.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-04-12T17:49:15.132Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d2c2a242cf4a961ad99f24686239d2575146811","dn":"After Life: A Novel by Rhian Ellis EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"2d2c2a242cf4a961ad99f24686239d2575146811","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,44,42,36,44,244,169,97,173,153,242,70,134,35,157,37,117,20,104,17]},"name":"After Life: A Novel by Rhian Ellis EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
