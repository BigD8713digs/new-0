Now back home in New Bordeaux, Lincoln is set on escaping a criminal past. But when his surrogate family, the black mob, is betrayed and wiped out by the Italian Mafia, Lincoln builds a new family on the ashes of the old and blazes a path of military-grade revenge through those responsible. Intense gun fights, visceral hand-to-hand combat, white knuckle driving and street smarts will all be needed. But with the right crew, tough decisions and some dirty hands, it&#x2019;s possible to make it to the top of the city&apos;s underworld","last_updated":"2018-05-26T12:07:55.943Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:2da6bbabfec4fc4815b0dc3fbc6f46f5e06aa0ae","dn":"Mafia.III.Digital.Deluxe.v1.01.Incl.2Dlcs-P2P","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"2da6bbabfec4fc4815b0dc3fbc6f46f5e06aa0ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,166,187,171,254,196,252,72,21,176,220,63,188,111,70,245,224,106,160,174]},"name":"Mafia.III.Digital.Deluxe.v1.01.Incl.2Dlcs-P2P","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
