Rapid advances are being made in porous silicon anodes for lithium batteries, biodegradable nanoparticles and nanoneedles for medical therapy and imaging, energetics and bio-diagnostic techniques. A number of additional characterization and processing techniques are also reviewed for the first time. Experts from 10 additional countries are involved in the 2nd edition: China, Vietnam, Singapore, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Netherlands, Switzerland, Belarus, and Brazil, making more than 40 countries in total. The handbook therefore covers expertise from every continent. Another new feature is a review dedicated to industrial activity. This second edition endeavours to provide the community with a truly comprehensive database and up-to-date commentary on this versatile nanostructured material.\r\n\r\nAbout the Author\r\nLeigh Canham has over 30 years of experience conducting research on widely differing aspects of silicon technology.  Two key personal discoveries &#x2013; that silicon can emit light efficiently (1990) and be rendered medically biodegradable (1995) have had significant academic impact (&gt;20,000 citations) and commercial impact (multiple company creation).  Leigh is a scientist devoted to finding novel properties and uses for the semiconductor that already pervades our everyday lives. \r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\nPart I Fabrication\r\nPart II Properties\r\nPart III Characterization\r\nPart IV Processing\r\nPart V Applications\r\nIndex\r\n <a href=\"\nhttps://s22.postimg.cc/e90b64sc1/Handbook_of_Porous_Silicon_2nd_Ed.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://s22.postimg.cc/e90b64sc1/Handbook_of_Porous_Silicon_2nd_Ed.jpg</a>","last_updated":"2018-06-05T12:13:29.361Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:1741987eafcbe801303d17b10dfe3725be4b9e47","dn":"Handbook of Porous Silicon (2nd Ed)(gnv64)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"1741987eafcbe801303d17b10dfe3725be4b9e47","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,65,152,126,175,203,232,1,48,61,23,177,13,254,55,37,190,75,158,71]},"name":"Handbook of Porous Silicon (2nd Ed)(gnv64)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
