After Shoreline, the tour followed the lines going south more than eight hours to San Diego for a show the very next day.  Coors Amphitheatre, as it was originally named, is a scenic 20,500 seat amphitheatre built on a former dairy farm near San Diego and opened in 1998.  Saturday, September 18th was the eighth show of fall tour and the first Phish show in Chula Vista.\r\n\r\nThe band rewarded those who traveled down to Chula Vista with a Tweezer opener that blew the leaves right off the palm trees.  The fourth-ever Tweezer show opener (first since Island Tour) led to more Set I highlights like a hot Wilson &gt; Maze and a deep grooving Tube &gt; Rocky Top to end set I.  In a mighty display of openers, set II launched straight into the stratosphere with a supersized Boogie On Reggae Woman.  Next came the syrupy funk of Meatstick &gt; Free, giving the Southern California crowd a chance to join the latest Phish dance craze.  Set II continued with a dripping psychedelic Harry Hood, and a Contact &gt; Tweezer Reprise encore that cemented Chula Vista 1999&#x2019;s place in Phish history as the first-ever full-show Tweezer Sandwich.\r\n\r\n- During Meatstick, the band brought members of the audience onstage to help teach the West Coast crowd the Meatstick dance","last_updated":"2018-06-16T12:11:28.785Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:37023885bb5a23e327da7d0bb2c2b1abcaeef99e","dn":"Phish - 1999-09-18 Chula Vista, CA (2018) [FLAC]","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"37023885bb5a23e327da7d0bb2c2b1abcaeef99e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,2,56,133,187,90,35,227,39,218,125,11,178,194,177,171,202,238,249,158]},"name":"Phish - 1999-09-18 Chula Vista, CA (2018) [FLAC]","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
