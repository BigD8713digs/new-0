In the early days, he and Pete Townshend would often try and one up each other&apos;s stage antics. Townshend stated in The Kids Are Alright, As soon as I started smashing something up, Keith, who&apos;s a great sort of joiner-inner used to smash up his drum kit!\r\n\r\nA lot of people really, really, really, have never understood how important Keith&apos;s drumming style was to the Who, said Roger Daltrey in the Who&apos;s Next DVD. I kind of describe it as, if you imagine Pete and [bassist] John [Entwistle] as two knitting needles, and Keith was the ball of wool. He would kind of keep it all together. \r\nHe was, in a sense, the soul of the band. Moon died Sept. 7, 1978, at age 32, and rock &apos;n&apos; roll hasn&apos;t been the same without him\r\n\r\nTracklist\r\n\r\n01 Introduction.mp3\r\n02 I Can&apos;t Explain.mp3\r\n03 Substitute.mp3\r\n04 Baba O&apos;Riley.mp3\r\n05 My Wife(Springfield 1975).mp3\r\n06 Behind Blue Eyes.mp3\r\n07 Dreaming From The Waist.mp3\r\n08 Pinball Wizard.mp3\r\n09 I&apos;m Free.mp3\r\n10 Tommy&apos;s Holiday Camp.mp3\r\n11 Summertime Blues.mp3\r\n12 Shakin&apos; All Over.mp3\r\n13 My Generation.mp3\r\n14 Join Together.mp3\r\n15 Who Are You.mp3\r\n16 Won&apos;t Get Fooled Again.mp3\r\n\r\nTheir classic line-up consisted of lead singer Roger Daltrey, guitarist and singer Pete Townshend, bass guitarist John Entwistle, and drummer Keith Moon.
