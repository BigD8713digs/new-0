He often came across as a man possessed, holding forth on culture and politics while mixing in personal revelations - all with mercurial, tongue-twisting intensity as he inhabited and shed one character after another with lightning speed. \r\n\r\nBut as Dave Itzkoff shows in this revelatory biography, Williams&#x2019; comic brilliance masked a deep well of conflicting emotions and self-doubt, which he drew upon in his comedy and in celebrated films like Dead Poets Society; Good Morning, Vietnam; The Fisher King; Aladdin; and Mrs. Doubtfire, where he showcased his limitless gift for improvisation to bring to life a wide range of characters. And in Good Will Hunting he gave an intense and controlled performance that revealed the true range of his talent. \r\n\r\nItzkoff also shows how Williams struggled mightily with addiction and depression - topics he discussed openly while performing and during interviews - and with a debilitating condition at the end of his life that affected him in ways his fans never knew. Drawing on more than a hundred original interviews with family, friends, and colleagues as well as extensive archival research, Robin is a fresh and original look at a man whose work touched so many lives.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-05-17T12:06:10.035Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb8dbe17a76b4df2978327be5ff762499821f226","dn":"Robin by Dave Itzkoff EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"fb8dbe17a76b4df2978327be5ff762499821f226","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,141,190,23,167,107,77,242,151,131,39,190,95,247,98,73,152,33,242,38]},"name":"Robin by Dave Itzkoff EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
