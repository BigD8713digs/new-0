Priest Kate still dreads the walk, but non-believer Raph is beginning to enjoy the opportunity it is giving him to appreciate his surroundings. They stop by a river and chat to Guy Hayward, who runs the British Pilgrimage Trust. He explains the meaning of river pilgrimage and encourages them to take a dip in the freezing water. Against his better judgement, Ed decides to join the swimming party, along with Kate, who is much happier in water than she is walking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal Air Date: 30-Mar-2018","last_updated":"2018-03-31T12:08:36.163Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:00569e669b3794004b16a7161213e66b82a02ada","dn":"Pilgrimage.The.Road.to.Santiago.S01E03.WEB-DL.x264-JIVE.mp4","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"00569e669b3794004b16a7161213e66b82a02ada","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,86,158,102,155,55,148,0,75,22,167,22,18,19,230,107,130,160,42,218]},"name":"Pilgrimage.The.Road.to.Santiago.S01E03.WEB-DL.x264-JIVE.mp4","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
