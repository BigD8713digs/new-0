Data from measures of adaptive behavior have been used most commonly in assessment and intervention services for persons with mental retardation. However, the display of adaptive behaviors and skills is relevant to all persons. The Adaptive Behavior Assessment System-II (ABAS-II) provides a comprehensive, norm-referenced assessment of the adaptive behavior and skills of individuals from birth through age 89. The comprehensive natures of the ABAS-II, ease in administration and scoring, and wide age range have resulted in its widespread use for a large number of assessment purposes. The book provides practical information and thus serves as a valuable resource for those who use the ABAS-II","last_updated":"2017-06-15T12:03:29.501Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:28462533f8258392c80e735b52f75e01e10d41b2","dn":"Adaptive Behavior Assessment System-II - Clinical Use and Interp","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"28462533f8258392c80e735b52f75e01e10d41b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,70,37,51,248,37,131,146,200,14,115,91,82,247,94,1,225,13,65,178]},"name":"Adaptive Behavior Assessment System-II - Clinical Use and Interp","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
