Outfitted with on-point pop culture references, these essays tackle a wide range of topics: giving feminism a tough-love talk on intersectionality, telling society&apos;s beauty standards to kick rocks, and calling foul on our culture&apos;s obsession with work. Robinson also gets personal, exploring money problems she&apos;s hidden from her parents, how dating is mainly a warmed-over bowl of hot mess, and definitely most important, meeting Bono not once, but twice. She&apos;s struggled with being a woman with a political mind and a woman with an ever-changing jeans size. She knows about trash because she sees it every day&#x2013;and because she&apos;s seen roughly one hundred thousand hours of reality TV and zero hours of Schindler&apos;s List. \r\n\r\nWith the intimate voice of a new best friend, Everything&apos;s Trash, But It&apos;s Okay is a candid perspective for a generation that has had the rug pulled out from under it too many times to count.\r\n\r\nGenre: Non-Fiction &gt; Biographies &amp; Memoirs","last_updated":"2018-10-17T12:32:31.319Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:afafc60988ccef4cf93212867531af0fd35db6ff","dn":"Everything's Trash, But It's Okay by Phoebe Robinson (.epub)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"afafc60988ccef4cf93212867531af0fd35db6ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,175,198,9,136,204,239,76,249,50,18,134,117,49,175,15,211,93,182,255]},"name":"Everything's Trash, But It's Okay by Phoebe Robinson (.epub)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
