And whether or not you&apos;ve been formally diagnosed with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), you probably already know that something&apos;s got to give.\r\n\r\nThe Queen of Distraction presents practical skills to help women with ADHD achieve focus and balance in all areas of life, whether it&apos;s at home, at work, or in relationships.
