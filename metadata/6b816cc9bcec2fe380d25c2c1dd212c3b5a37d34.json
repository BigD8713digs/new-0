Polaris - the bright star, the star of hope and faith. Well the Polaris sector has precious little of either; just a wilderness of gas, stars, and supernovas soaked in treachery, oppression, and the lust for power. \r\n\r\nCan anyone build an empire in a place like this? Other factions are naturally suspicious of newcomers and may wage war at the first sign of unidentified craft. Here, a natural death is an uncommon luxury. You look weak? Pirates and scavengers will plunder your planets. You show military strength to discourage potential enemies? Your rivals will combine their forces to eliminate the threat. \r\n\r\nFor more info go to: https://www.gog.com/game/polaris_sector","last_updated":"2017-12-10T12:04:40.924Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b816cc9bcec2fe380d25c2c1dd212c3b5a37d34","dn":"Polaris.Sector.Gold.Edition-GOG","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"6b816cc9bcec2fe380d25c2c1dd212c3b5a37d34","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,129,108,201,188,236,47,227,128,210,92,44,29,210,18,195,181,163,125,52]},"name":"Polaris.Sector.Gold.Edition-GOG","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
