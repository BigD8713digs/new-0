This is true of many cultures, but in Hawaii no one seems to have left. And in Hawaii a set of myths accompanied each of these migrants - legends that shape our understanding of this mysterious place.\r\n\r\nIn Paradise of the Pacific, Susanna Moore, the award-winning author of In the Cut and The Life of Objects, pieces together the elusive, dramatic story of late-18th-century Hawaii - its kings and queens, gods and goddesses, missionaries, migrants, and explorers - a not-so-distant time of abrupt transition in which an isolated pagan world of human sacrifice and strict taboo, without a currency or a written language, was confronted with the equally ritualized world of capitalism, Western education, and Christian values.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-09-30T12:04:16.225Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:828cd0968b76d8f1d7cdf42b6411b7c3da772f92","dn":"Paradise of the Pacific_ Approaching Hawaii by Susanna Moore MOB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"828cd0968b76d8f1d7cdf42b6411b7c3da772f92","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,140,208,150,139,118,216,241,215,205,244,43,100,17,183,195,218,119,47,146]},"name":"Paradise of the Pacific_ Approaching Hawaii by Susanna Moore MOB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
