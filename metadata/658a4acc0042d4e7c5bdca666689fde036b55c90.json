But how can you get started working in a wide-ranging, interdisciplinary field that&#x2019;s so clouded in hype? This insightful book, based on Columbia University&#x2019;s Introduction to Data Science class, tells you what you need to know.\r\n\r\nIn many of these chapter-long lectures, data scientists from companies such as Google, Microsoft, and eBay share new algorithms, methods, and models by presenting case studies and the code they use. If you&#x2019;re familiar with linear algebra, probability, and statistics, and have programming experience, this book is an ideal introduction to data science.\r\n\r\nTopics include:\r\n\r\n    Statistical inference, exploratory data analysis, and the data science process\r\n    Algorithms\r\n    Spam filters, Naive Bayes, and data wrangling\r\n    Logistic regression\r\n    Financial modeling\r\n    Recommendation engines and causality\r\n    Data visualization\r\n    Social networks and data journalism\r\n    Data engineering, MapReduce, Pregel, and Hadoop","last_updated":"2017-06-13T12:01:41.828Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:658a4acc0042d4e7c5bdca666689fde036b55c90","dn":"Doing Data Science: Straight Talk from the Frontline by Cathy O'","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"658a4acc0042d4e7c5bdca666689fde036b55c90","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,138,74,204,0,66,212,231,197,189,202,102,102,137,253,224,54,181,92,144]},"name":"Doing Data Science: Straight Talk from the Frontline by Cathy O'","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
