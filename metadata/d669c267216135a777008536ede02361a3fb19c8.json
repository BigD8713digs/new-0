Its a love letter to Harlem shown through the people, music, soul, and food. Marcus Ethiopian and Swedish upbringing converge with his Harlem-American present to give readers a culinary clash of dishes to try, all mirroring the menus at his much loved neighbourhood restaurant Red Rooster.\r\n\r\nRecipes range from the restaurants Deviled Eggs with Chicken Skin Mayo, Obama Fried Ribs, Whole Fried Fish with Grits, Curried Goat Stew, Sunday Tomato Eggs, and Uncle Ts Meatballs. He reinvents traditional home comfort foods like macaroni cheese and Swedish meatballs with exciting twists and new flavour combinations, placing them centre stage at the dinner table.\r\n\r\nMarcus dedicates the book, To the people of Harlem, especially the generation before mine who cared, restored and fought for uptown, to make sure Harlem would be a special neighbourhood in the greatest city  a place I am lucky to call home.\r\n\r\nFull of heritage and culture, music and love, this is far more than just a cookbook","last_updated":"2017-07-27T12:00:56.018Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:d669c267216135a777008536ede02361a3fb19c8","dn":" The Red Rooster Cookbook (2017) [WWRG]","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"d669c267216135a777008536ede02361a3fb19c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,105,194,103,33,97,53,167,119,0,133,54,237,224,35,97,163,251,25,200]},"name":" The Red Rooster Cookbook (2017) [WWRG]","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
