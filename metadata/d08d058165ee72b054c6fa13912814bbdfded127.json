Yet we are often taught to ignore it, overcome it, push past it. But to what benefit? This is the essential question that guides Kristen Ulmer&#x2019;s remarkable exploration of our most misunderstood emotion in The Art of Fear.\r\n\r\nOnce recognized as the best extreme skier in the world (an honor she held for twelve years), Ulmer knows fear well. In this conversation-changing book, she argues that fear is not here to cause us problems&#x2014;and that in fact, the only true issue we face with fear is our misguided reaction to it (not the fear itself).\r\n\r\nGenre: Non Fiction &gt; Psychology, Emotions","last_updated":"2018-09-21T12:28:30.942Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:d08d058165ee72b054c6fa13912814bbdfded127","dn":" The Art of Fear by Kristen Ulmer (.epub)(.azw3)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"d08d058165ee72b054c6fa13912814bbdfded127","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,141,5,129,101,238,114,176,84,198,250,19,145,40,20,187,223,222,209,39]},"name":" The Art of Fear by Kristen Ulmer (.epub)(.azw3)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
