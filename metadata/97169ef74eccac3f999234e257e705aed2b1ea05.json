The legend grew up that this was the perfect heist. However the criminals involved are now all in jail. All except one. The man who the press called Mr Ginger. The man who called himself Basil. No one knows who he is. The story of how he came to be part of this gang may or may not be true. It&apos;s a story that spans thirty years, and involves many of the most notorious characters in the world of organised crime. It&apos;s a story of murder, vengeance and gold. \r\n\r\n(60 mins)","last_updated":"2017-06-11T12:05:27.951Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:97169ef74eccac3f999234e257e705aed2b1ea05","dn":"The Hatton Garden Heist - 2017 BBC Audio Drama","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"97169ef74eccac3f999234e257e705aed2b1ea05","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,22,158,247,78,204,172,63,153,146,52,226,87,231,5,174,210,177,234,5]},"name":"The Hatton Garden Heist - 2017 BBC Audio Drama","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
