Hollywood royalty, rock stars, and models flocked to the hotel&apos;s club to order bottle after bottle of Dom and to snort lines alongside narcos, hit men, and gunrunners, all while marathon orgies burned upstairs in elaborate fantasy suites.\r\n\r\nAmid the boatloads of powder and cash reigned the new kings of Miami: three waves of Cuban immigrants vying to dominate the trafficking of one of the most lucrative commodities ever known to man. But as the kilos - and bodies - began to pile up, the Mutiny became target number one for law enforcement.\r\n\r\nBased on exclusive interviews and never-before-seen documents, Hotel Scarface is a portrait of a city high on excess and greed, an extraordinary work of investigative journalism offering an unprecedented view of the rise and fall of cocaine - and the Mutiny - in Miami.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-01-18T18:58:09.033Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ad8420bea808c05625bd28fa2ae93597a2a90c5","dn":"Hotel Scarface_ Where Cocaine Cowboys .. by Roben Farzad EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"7ad8420bea808c05625bd28fa2ae93597a2a90c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,216,66,11,234,128,140,5,98,91,210,143,162,174,147,89,122,42,144,197]},"name":"Hotel Scarface_ Where Cocaine Cowboys .. by Roben Farzad EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
