Not so in today&apos;s Federal Republic, however, where the gears of the so-called &quot;elevator society&quot; have long since ground to a halt. In the absence of the social mobility of yesterday, widespread social exhaustion and anxiety have emerged across mainstream society. Oliver Nachtwey analyses the reasons for this social rupture in post-war German society and investigates the conflict potential emerging as a result, concluding that although the country has managed to muddle through the Eurocrisis largely unscathed thus far, simmering tensions beneath the surface nevertheless threaten to undermine the German system&apos;s stability in the years to come.\r\n\r\nGenre: Non-Fiction &gt;  History &amp; Theory","last_updated":"2018-11-23T12:13:33.300Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:c5789af25310b29a8e5174a2f7c95c14eef78d2e","dn":"Germany's Hidden Crisis by Oliver Nachtwey (.epub)(.azw3)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"c5789af25310b29a8e5174a2f7c95c14eef78d2e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,120,154,242,83,16,178,154,142,81,116,162,247,201,92,20,238,247,141,46]},"name":"Germany's Hidden Crisis by Oliver Nachtwey (.epub)(.azw3)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
