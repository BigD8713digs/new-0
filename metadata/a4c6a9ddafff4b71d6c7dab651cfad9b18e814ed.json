The place was Wall Street. The game was called Liar&#x2019;s Poker.\r\n\r\nMichael Lewis was fresh out of Princeton and the London School of Economics when he landed a job at Salomon Brothers, one of Wall Street&#x2019;s premier investment firms. During the next three years, Lewis rose from callow trainee to bond salesman, raking in millions for the firm and cashing in on a modern-day gold rush. \r\n\r\nLiar&#x2019;s Poker is the culmination of those heady, frenzied years&#x2014;a behind-the-scenes look at a unique and turbulent time in American business. From the frat-boy camaraderie of the forty-first-floor trading room to the killer instinct that made ambitious young men gamble everything on a high-stakes game of bluffing and deception, here is Michael Lewis&#x2019;s knowing and hilarious insider&#x2019;s account of an unprecedented era of greed, gluttony, and outrageous fortune.\r\n\r\nGenre: Non-Fiction &gt; Money &gt; Investing","last_updated":"2018-09-17T12:16:52.987Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4c6a9ddafff4b71d6c7dab651cfad9b18e814ed","dn":"Liar's Poker by Michael Lewis (.mobi)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"a4c6a9ddafff4b71d6c7dab651cfad9b18e814ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,198,169,221,175,255,75,113,214,199,218,182,81,207,173,155,24,232,20,237]},"name":"Liar's Poker by Michael Lewis (.mobi)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
