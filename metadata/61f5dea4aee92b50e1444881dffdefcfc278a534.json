Holding guards and civilian employees hostage, the prisoners negotiated with officials for improved conditions during the four long days and nights that followed. \r\n\r\nOn September 13, the state abruptly sent hundreds of heavily armed troopers and correction officers to retake the prison by force. Their gunfire killed 39 men hostages as well as prisoners and severely wounded more than 100 others. \r\n\r\nIn the ensuing hours, weeks, and months, troopers and officers brutally retaliated against the prisoners. And, ultimately, New York State authorities prosecuted only the prisoners, never once bringing charges against the officials involved in the retaking and its aftermath, and neglecting to provide support to the survivors and the families of the men who had been killed. \r\n\r\nDrawing from more than a decade of extensive research, historian Heather Ann Thompson sheds new light on every aspect of the uprising and its legacy, giving voice to all those who took part in this 45 year fight for justice: prisoners, former hostages, families of the victims, lawyers and judges, and state officials and members of law enforcement. \r\n\r\nBlood in the Water is the searing and indelible account of one of the most important civil rights stories of the last century.\r\n\r\n\r\nRead by: Erin Bennett\r\n\r\nFormat: Stereo mp3\r\n\r\nBit Rate: 128Kbps/44.1Hz\r\n\r\n\r\nRemember to tip your uploader and seed! :)","last_updated":"2018-06-03T12:10:09.727Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:61f5dea4aee92b50e1444881dffdefcfc278a534","dn":"Blood in the Water [The Attica Prison Uprising]-Heather Thompson","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"61f5dea4aee92b50e1444881dffdefcfc278a534","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,245,222,164,174,233,43,80,225,68,72,129,223,253,239,207,194,120,165,52]},"name":"Blood in the Water [The Attica Prison Uprising]-Heather Thompson","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
