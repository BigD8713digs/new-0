The comprehensive CAD software enables designers to quickly create, evaluate, and modify their models. The software is sold as one &#x201C;fully loaded&#x201D; package, with all features and functions, for one very affordable price. VariCAD delivers an excellent performance-to-price ratio, making it one of the smartest choices on the market today.\r\n\r\nUser Interface and System Environment\r\nVariCAD&#x2019;s Graphical User Interface (GUI) has been designed to allow quick and intuitive 3D/2D orientation. It has been carefully tailored and tuned to reflect the thought process of a designer, so that ideas can be captured and communicated with a minimal number of steps. All commands were created with a focus on ease of use.\r\n\r\nYou can start by creating a 3D model and then use it to automatically create drawings files, or you can draw only in 2D. Designing in 3D is generally more &#x201C;natural,&#x201D; in that it closely represents actual parts and assemblies. The 3D approach is usually more intuitive than 2D drafting. Models created in 3D are easily converted into conventional 2D documentation. VariCAD provides tools for 2D updates after changes of 3D models.\r\n\r\n3D Modeling\r\nVariCAD provides a library of basic 3D shapes (like a box, cylinder, cone, etc.), which are easily modified by editing their dimensions. Solids can be created also by profile rotation, extrusion, or lofting. More complex tools include rotation blending between two profiles, lofting between a circle and rectangle or between different profiles, and creation of helical surfaces","last_updated":"2018-10-30T12:10:38.562Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:88fd1d7d0115adb0a8470357293a4d67af922393","dn":"VariCAD 2018 2.10 Build 20180616 Full   Medicine[BabuPC]","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"88fd1d7d0115adb0a8470357293a4d67af922393","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,253,29,125,1,21,173,176,168,71,3,87,41,58,77,103,175,146,35,147]},"name":"VariCAD 2018 2.10 Build 20180616 Full   Medicine[BabuPC]","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
