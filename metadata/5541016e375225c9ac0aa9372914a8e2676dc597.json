Inspired by the pioneering parenting philosophy of her friend and mentor, Magda Gerber, Janet&apos;s influential voice encourages parents and child-care professionals to perceive babies as unique, capable human beings with natural abilities to learn without being taught; to develop motor and cognitive skills; communicate; face age appropriate struggles; initiate and direct independent play for extended periods; and much more. Once we are able to view our children in this light, even the most common daily parenting experiences become stimulating opportunities to learn, discover, and to connect with our child. Elevating Child Care is a collection of 30 popular and widely discussed articles from Janet&apos;s website that focus on some of the most common infant/toddler issues: eating, sleeping, diaper changes, communication, separation, focus and attention span, creativity, boundaries, and more. Eschewing the quick-fix tips and tricks of popular parenting culture, Janet&apos;s insightful philosophy lays the foundation for a closer, more fulfilling parent/child relationship, and children who grow up to be authentic, confident, successful adults.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-01-23T12:00:27.349Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:5541016e375225c9ac0aa9372914a8e2676dc597","dn":"Elevating Child Care by Janet Lansbury EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"5541016e375225c9ac0aa9372914a8e2676dc597","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,65,1,110,55,82,37,201,172,10,169,55,41,20,168,226,103,109,197,151]},"name":"Elevating Child Care by Janet Lansbury EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
