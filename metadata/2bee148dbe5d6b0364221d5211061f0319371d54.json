The one-on-one bullying that dominates the national conversation, this timely book suggests, is actually part of a larger problem&#x2014;a natural outcome of the bullying nature of our national institutions.\r\n\r\nAnd as long as the United States embraces militarism and aggressive capitalism, systemic bullying and all its impacts&#x2014;at home and abroad&#x2014;will persist as a major crisis.\r\n\r\nBullying looks very similar on the personal and institutional levels: it involves an imbalance of power and behavior that consistently undermines its victim, securing compliance and submission and reinforcing the bully&apos;s sense of superiority and legitimacy.\r\n\r\nThe similarity, this book tells us, is not a coincidence. Applying the concept of the &#x201C;sociological imagination,&#x201D; which links private problems and public issues, authors Charles Derber and Yale Magrass argue that individual bullying is an outgrowth&#x2014;and a necessary function&#x2014;of a larger social phenomenon.\r\n\r\nBullying is seen here as a structural problem arising from systems organized around steep power hierarchies&#x2014;from the halls of the Pentagon, Congress, and corporate offices to classrooms and playing fields and the environment.\r\nIn the United States a system of intertwined corporations, governments, and military institutions carries out &#x201C;systemic bullying&#x201D; to create profits and sustain its own power.\r\n\r\nIt is only by recognizing the bullying built into this model that we can address the real problem, and in this, Bully Nation makes a hopeful beginning.\r\n\r\nCharles Derber is professor in the Department of Sociology at Boston College","last_updated":"2017-09-15T12:00:56.086Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:2bee148dbe5d6b0364221d5211061f0319371d54","dn":"Bully Nation: How the American Establishment Creates a Bullying ","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"2bee148dbe5d6b0364221d5211061f0319371d54","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,238,20,141,190,93,107,3,100,34,29,82,17,6,31,3,25,55,29,84]},"name":"Bully Nation: How the American Establishment Creates a Bullying ","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
