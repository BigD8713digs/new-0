It describes how to combine decision trees, clustering, multi-attribute decision-making algorithms and Monte Carlo Simulation with the mathematical description of imprecise or vague information, and how to visualize such information. Moreover, it discusses a broad spectrum of real-life management problems including forecasting the apparent consumption of steel products, planning and scheduling of production processes, project portfolio selection and economic-risk estimation. It is a concise, yet comprehensive, reference source for researchers in decision-making and decision-makers in business organizations alike.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n <a href=\"\nhttp://dlfeb.com/book/advances-in-fuzzy-decision-making-theory-and-practice-studies-in-fuzziness-and-soft-computing/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttp://dlfeb.com/book/advances-in-fuzzy-decision-making-theory-and-practice-studies-in-fuzziness-and-soft-computing/</a>","last_updated":"2017-07-29T12:00:30.914Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:42220cf38f88697deb95e9caf06ff8b1b4fd7c9c","dn":"ADVANCES IN FUZZY DECISION MAKING","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"42220cf38f88697deb95e9caf06ff8b1b4fd7c9c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,34,12,243,143,136,105,125,235,149,233,202,240,111,248,177,180,253,124,156]},"name":"ADVANCES IN FUZZY DECISION MAKING","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
