No other text on the market takes this approach, nor offers the comprehensive and up-to-date treatment that Koren and Krishna provide. This book incorporates case studies that highlight six different computer systems with fault-tolerance techniques implemented in their design. A complete ancillary package is available to lecturers, including online solutions manual for instructors and PowerPoint slides. Students, designers, and architects of high performance processors will value this comprehensive overview of the field. * The first book on fault tolerance design with a systems approach* Comprehensive coverage of both hardware and software fault tolerance, as well as information and time redundancy* Incorporated case studies highlight six different computer systems with fault-tolerance techniques implemented in their design* Available to lecturers is a complete ancillary package including online solutions manual for instructors and PowerPoint slides","last_updated":"2017-05-09T19:36:42.360Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:83a4daf6cc38fd19cdaf5258b704b2d0ea1f92b8","dn":"Fault-Tolerant Systems (mrkiven0).pdf","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"83a4daf6cc38fd19cdaf5258b704b2d0ea1f92b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,164,218,246,204,56,253,25,205,175,82,88,183,4,178,208,234,31,146,184]},"name":"Fault-Tolerant Systems (mrkiven0).pdf","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
