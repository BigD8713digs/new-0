Sam Callahan learned this lesson from a childhood spent in abusive foster care, on the streets, and locked in juvie. With the past behind him and his future staked on law school, he is moonlighting as a political tracker, paid to hide in crowds and shadow candidates, recording their missteps for use by their opponents. One night, after an anonymous text tip, Sam witnesses a congressional candidate and a mysterious blonde in a motel indiscretion that ends in murder, recording it all on his phone.\r\n\r\nNow Sam is a target. Set up to take the fall and pursued by both assassins and the FBI, he is forced to go on the run. Using the street skills forged during his troubled youth - as well as his heightened mental abilities - Sam goes underground until he can uncover who is behind the conspiracy and how far up it goes. A taut thriller with an unforgettable young hero, The Tracker is a heart-stopping debut from an exciting new voice.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-03-22T15:02:27.781Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c55534d9eb2ba4c8968d15d7e3fa1aad1d0fdf8","dn":"The Tracker by Chad Zunker EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"8c55534d9eb2ba4c8968d15d7e3fa1aad1d0fdf8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,85,83,77,158,178,186,76,137,104,209,93,126,63,161,170,209,208,253,248]},"name":"The Tracker by Chad Zunker EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
