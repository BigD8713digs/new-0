As important as new functionality may be, releases that refine past features are just as crucial.\r\n\r\nWe don&apos;t neglect our housekeeping duties here at Exodus. Dash P2P connection errors are now a thing of the past, mainnet Tron support has been polished to a mirror sheen, charting bugs on the Portfolio page are now in the green, and fractional rounding errors for Ethereum/ERC20 tokens in the Exchange menu will no longer afflict your wallet.\r\n\r\n\r\nPortfolio\r\nNegative balances caused by inaccurate pricing data feeds on the portfolio are now a thing of the past. We can&apos;t always make the market go up but we absolutely will make sure our charts are sitting pretty.\r\nWallet\r\nOccasionally we had reports of Dash banner error messages on slower networks. Our Dash networking code has been updated and users should not see this banner unless there is a confirmed problem connecting to an asset network.\r\nWe added back in the option to easily click the send ALL button for Tron (TRX). The Tron network calculates transactions a bit different but Exodus does all the hard work to send ALL of your Tron with one push-of-a-button","last_updated":"2018-09-30T12:40:37.045Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:7125f91a1e66a882a5bf07a231400f0edfd2bbd2","dn":"Exodus wallet coin Latest Release 1.61.0","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"7125f91a1e66a882a5bf07a231400f0edfd2bbd2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,37,249,26,30,102,168,130,165,191,7,162,49,64,15,14,223,210,187,210]},"name":"Exodus wallet coin Latest Release 1.61.0","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
