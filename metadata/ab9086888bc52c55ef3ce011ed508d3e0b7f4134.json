To that end it includes several open source tools such as parted, gparted, partclone, clonezilla, ddrescue, and secure delete, among others.\r\n\r\n\r\nMD5SUM:\r\n\r\n764d4bc0780fd3ed8f3d538fb56c5188 *pmagic_2018_01_08.iso\r\n78ec4d9611dc41e36cdb92dedca36522 *pmagic_pxe_2018_01_08.tar.gz\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE: For those incapable of figuring out why my releases are larger than those by other people: It is because I release the complete Parted Magic package, including the PXE files. Like it says on the PM website, if you don&apos;t know what PXE is, then you don&apos;t need the PXE file.\r\n\r\n\r\nParted Magic 2018_01_08 News\r\nThe Linux kernel has been updated to 4.14.11. I have received a lot of glowing reviews of the newer video cards it supports and it&apos;s stability. The 2017_09_05 release was our most successful release to date with very little complaints. Instead of changing a bunch of stuff for the sake of changing a bunch of stuff, we basically kept it the way it was. We only addressed the little issues and updated relevant software.\r\n\r\n\r\nSee the changelog for a complete list of updated programs.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHANGE LOG:\r\n <a href=\"\nhttps://partedmagic.com/changelog/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://partedmagic.com/changelog/</a>\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE:\r\n\r\nPatrick Verner has decided to take this project commercial without any provision for non-profit or low-income individuals. While I applaud his recent creation of a student version, $49 per year is almost twice what some commercial partition/disk utilities go for. While it is true that Parted Magic offers more functionality, it is all via the work of others and without support, while the commercial offerings come with support.\r\n\t\t\r\nIn order to insure access to this excellent product for low-income individuals and non-profits, I am dedicating myself to purchasing this software and insuring it is available to these users. In this spirit, please, if you can afford this software, then purchase it","last_updated":"2018-01-23T12:01:37.566Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab9086888bc52c55ef3ce011ed508d3e0b7f4134","dn":"Parted Magic 2018-01-08 (pmagic_2018_01_08)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"ab9086888bc52c55ef3ce011ed508d3e0b7f4134","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,144,134,136,139,197,44,85,239,60,224,17,237,80,141,62,11,127,65,52]},"name":"Parted Magic 2018-01-08 (pmagic_2018_01_08)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
