It&apos;s not just the nearly bankrupt real estate agent who&apos;s being held prisoner; every other resident is also being confined within the town&apos;s boundaries by an invisible force field that cannot be breached. As local tensions rapidly reach a breaking point, a set of bizarre circumstances leads Brad to the source of their captivity, making him humanity&apos;s reluctant ambassador to an alien race of sentient flora and privy to these jailers&apos; ultimate intentions. But some of Millville&apos;s most powerful citizens don&apos;t take kindly to Carter&apos;s &quot;collaboration with the enemy&quot;, even under the sudden threat of global apocalypse.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-12-25T12:06:00.262Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:f21bdf7ed00cb3645718d1e1320c039b77c17520","dn":"All Flesh Is Grass by Clifford Simak EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"f21bdf7ed00cb3645718d1e1320c039b77c17520","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,27,223,126,208,12,179,100,87,24,209,225,50,12,3,155,119,193,117,32]},"name":"All Flesh Is Grass by Clifford Simak EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
