It follows the adventures of the Starfleet vessel USS Voyager, which becomes stranded in the Delta Quadrant (on the far side of the Milky Way galaxy, 70,000 light-years from Earth) while searching for a renegade Maquis ship.[3] Voyager has to make the estimated 75-year journey home.\r\n\r\nThe series was created by Rick Berman, Michael Piller, and Jeri Taylor, and is the fifth incarnation of Star Trek, which began with the 1960s series Star Trek: The Original Series that was created by Gene Roddenberry. Voyager was produced for seven seasons, from 1995 to 2001, and is the first Star Trek TV series with a female captain, Kathryn Janeway (played by Kate Mulgrew), as the lead character. Berman served as head executive producer in charge of the overall production for the series during its entire run. He was assisted by a second in command executive producer who generally functioned as the day-to-day showrunner. Four were used throughout the series&apos; run: Michael Piller (EP/showrunner &#x2013; first and second season), Jeri Taylor (EP &#x2013; first through fourth seasons, showrunner &#x2013; third and fourth seasons), Brannon Braga (EP/showrunner &#x2013; fifth and sixth seasons), and Kenneth Biller (EP/showrunner &#x2013; seventh season). Star Trek: Voyager aired on UPN and was the network&apos;s second-longest running series","last_updated":"2017-12-17T12:03:26.436Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:031de2da9ab58f026c69c49d45050daf60f4e0c6","dn":"Star Trek Voyager - COMPLETE - Season 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"031de2da9ab58f026c69c49d45050daf60f4e0c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,29,226,218,154,181,143,2,108,105,196,157,69,5,13,175,96,244,224,198]},"name":"Star Trek Voyager - COMPLETE - Season 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
