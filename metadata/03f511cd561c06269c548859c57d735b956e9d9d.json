They are\r\n&gt;&gt; easy to learn and fun to sing. Some of the songs appear twice, once with\r\n&gt;&gt; complete lyrics and once with blank spaces where the children sing lyrics they\r\n&gt;&gt; have created and verbalized.\r\n&gt;&gt; After children have sung a song and are familiar with it they are ready for the\r\n&gt;&gt; Fill-In-The Blanks version. For instance, to do Grandmother&#x2019;s Farm, you might\r\n&gt;&gt; ask the children, &#x201C;What are four more animals you could find on a farm?&#x201D; Write\r\n&gt;&gt; the four suggestions on the board. Then play the Fill-In-The Blanks version of\r\n&gt;&gt; Grandmother&#x2019;s Farm using the animals the children have thought of (For each song\r\n&gt;&gt; that has a Fill-In-The Blanks version, you will find a sample question for\r\n&gt;&gt; eliciting the children&#x2019;s responses.)\r\n&gt;&gt; Many of the songs have Instant Sing Lines. The Instant Sing Line is a phrase or\r\n&gt;&gt; sentence that repeats itself throughout the song. Because it can be learned\r\n&gt;&gt; quickly, the children are able to participate right away.\r\n\r\n--- Track listing ---\r\n\r\nWitches&apos; Brew \r\nGrandmothers Farm \r\nClickety Clack \r\nThe Eagle \r\nScamper \r\nThey Go Together \r\nSpace Explorer \r\nGoodnight \r\nPack Up The Sleigh","last_updated":"2018-05-01T12:08:50.426Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:03f511cd561c06269c548859c57d735b956e9d9d","dn":"Hap Palmer - Witches' Brew (Children's Music) AAC 320","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"03f511cd561c06269c548859c57d735b956e9d9d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,245,17,205,86,28,6,38,156,84,136,89,197,125,115,91,149,110,157,157]},"name":"Hap Palmer - Witches' Brew (Children's Music) AAC 320","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
