In The Ends of the World, Peter Brannen dives into deep time, exploring Earth&apos;s past dead ends, and in the process offers us a glimpse of our possible future.\r\n\r\nMany scientists now believe that the climate shifts of the 21st century have analogs in these five extinctions. Using the visible clues these devastations have left behind in the fossil record, The Ends of the World takes us inside &quot;scenes of the crime&quot;, from South Africa to the New York Palisades, to tell the story of each extinction. Brannen examines the fossil record - which is rife with creatures like dragonflies the size of sea gulls and guillotine-mouthed fish - and introduces us to the researchers on the front lines who, using the forensic tools of modern science, are piecing together what really happened at the crime scenes of the Earth&apos;s biggest whodunits.\r\n\r\nPart road trip, part history, and part cautionary tale, The Ends of the World takes us on a tour of the ways that our planet has clawed itself back from the grave and casts our future in a completely new light.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-08-19T12:00:57.294Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:15a72ff2691e72bb42d6f81916a49a871f760268","dn":"The Ends of the World_ Volcanic Apocalypses, Lethal Oceans ... b","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"15a72ff2691e72bb42d6f81916a49a871f760268","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,167,47,242,105,30,114,187,66,214,248,25,22,164,154,135,31,118,2,104]},"name":"The Ends of the World_ Volcanic Apocalypses, Lethal Oceans ... b","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
