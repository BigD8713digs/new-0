In most cases, these binaural\r\nmixes have a much higher dynamic range than the official stereo mixes,\r\nmeaning they have a much more open (as opposed to compressed) sound.\r\n\r\nThe script used to produce these files can be found here: <a href=\"\nhttps://github.com/bucaneer/binauralconv\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://github.com/bucaneer/binauralconv</a>\r\n\r\nFurther reading and resources: <a href=\"\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head-related_transfer_function\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head-related_transfer_function</a> <a href=\"\nhttp://www.sofaconventions.org/mediawiki/index.php/Main_Page\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttp://www.sofaconventions.org/mediawiki/index.php/Main_Page</a> <a href=\"\nhttps://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html#headphone\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html#headphone</a>\r\n\r\n========================================================================\r\n\r\nAll files FLAC, stereo, 24bit, 48kHz.\r\n\r\n[2006] The Great Cold Distance\r\nBased on 5.1 mix from 2007 DVD-A release by Jens Bogren\r\n\r\n[2012] Dead End Kings\r\nBased on 5.1 mix from 2012 DVD-A release by Jens Bogren\r\n\r\n[2016] The Fall of Hearts\r\nBased on 5.1 mix from 2016 DVD-V release by Bruce Soord","last_updated":"2018-01-28T12:13:54.371Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:f3bc9029b97c40d1e05c4e6b5369be19f37705cb","dn":"Katatonia - BINAURAL SURROUND discography (2006-2016)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"f3bc9029b97c40d1e05c4e6b5369be19f37705cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,188,144,41,185,124,64,209,224,92,78,107,83,105,190,25,243,119,5,203]},"name":"Katatonia - BINAURAL SURROUND discography (2006-2016)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
