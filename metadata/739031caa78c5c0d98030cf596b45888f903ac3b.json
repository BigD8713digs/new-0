Forty minutes later, rescuers found the body of four-year-old Eldon. Miraculously, his seven-year-old sister, Trinity, was saved. As the public cried out for blood, Amanda was arrested, convicted, and sentenced to thirty-five years in prison.\r\n\r\nEmbarking on a seven-year quest for the truth, Rommelmann traced the roots of Amanda&#x2019;s fury and desperation through thousands of pages of records, withheld documents, meetings with lawyers and convicts, and interviews with friends and family who felt shocked, confused, and emotionally swindled by a woman whose entire life was now defined by an unspeakable crime. At the heart of that crime: a tempestuous marriage, a family on the fast track to self-destruction, and a myriad of secrets and lies as dark and turbulent as the Willamette River.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-06-08T12:00:54.584Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:739031caa78c5c0d98030cf596b45888f903ac3b","dn":"To the Bridge by Nancy Rommelmann EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"739031caa78c5c0d98030cf596b45888f903ac3b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,144,49,202,167,140,92,13,152,3,12,245,150,180,88,136,249,3,172,59]},"name":"To the Bridge by Nancy Rommelmann EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
