I&#x2019;ve launched my fair share of Udemy courses, but I&#x2019;ve never done anything quite this crazy.\r\n\r\nThis course is a unique experience on Udemy. There are dozens of existing Python courses you can choose from, but this course is the only one that has nearly 200 interactive challenges you can complete right here in your browser. I didn&#x2019;t just tack on a couple of exercises at the end; this course is fully built around the coding exercises.   This course is all about getting you writing code ASAP, rather than sitting back watching a bunch of videos.\r\n\r\nIn development, I referred to this course as a hybrid between a typical Udemy course and an interactive Codecademy-style course.  You get over 25 hours of in-depth videos and my dumb jokes along with meticulously created exercises and quizzes to test your knowledge as you go.\r\n\r\nMany of the older Python courses still focus on Python 2.  This course is all about writing the most modern, up-to-date Python code, so Python 3 was the obvious choice.  The course covers all the latest additions and changes to the Python language.  The course also places a large emphasis on thinking like a Python developer, and writing code the &#x201C;Pythonic&#x201D; way.\r\nIf you want to take ONE COURSE to master Python take this course.\r\nWho is the target audience?\r\n\r\n    Anyone who wants to learn Python.\r\n    Anyone who is curious about data science, machine learning, or web development\r\n    Anyone who wants to get tons of practice with the interactive exercises.\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n\r\n    A computer! We&#x2019;ve got you covered whether you have a Mac or a PC.\r\n    Prepare to write thousands of lines of python exercises!\r\n    No previous experience with Python or coding is required","last_updated":"2018-04-25T12:09:19.983Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:928ee0991faf1f31ebe078200a85baf209224b63","dn":"Udemy - The Modern Python 3 Bootcamp","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"928ee0991faf1f31ebe078200a85baf209224b63","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,142,224,153,31,175,31,49,235,224,120,32,10,133,186,242,9,34,75,99]},"name":"Udemy - The Modern Python 3 Bootcamp","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
