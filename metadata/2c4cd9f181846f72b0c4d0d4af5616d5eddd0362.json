His father was absent; his mother was volatile and abusive.\r\n\r\nAt the age of 12, Ryan was sent to Virginia&apos;s juvenile facility of last resort. He was placed in solitary confinement. He was uncontrollable, uncontainable, with little hope for the future.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, at the age of 24, Ryan won a nationwide competition hosted by New York&apos;s Metropolitan Opera, beating out 1,200 other talented singers. Today he is a rising star performing major roles at the Met and Europe&apos;s most prestigious opera houses.\r\n\r\nSing for Your Life chronicles Ryan&apos;s suspenseful, racially charged, and artistically intricate journey from solitary confinement to stardom. Daniel Bergner takes readers on Ryan&apos;s path toward redemption, introducing us to a cast of memorable characters - including the two teachers from his childhood who redirected his rage into music and his long-lost father, who finally reappeared to hear Ryan sing. Bergner illuminates all that it takes - technically, creatively - to find and foster the beauty of the human voice. And Sing for Your Life sheds unique light on the enduring and complex realities of race in America","last_updated":"2017-06-14T12:00:37.367Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c4cd9f181846f72b0c4d0d4af5616d5eddd0362","dn":"Daniel Bergner - Sing for Your Life 2016 RETAiL ePUB eBOOK-DiSTR","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"2c4cd9f181846f72b0c4d0d4af5616d5eddd0362","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,76,217,241,129,132,111,114,176,196,208,212,175,86,22,213,237,221,3,98]},"name":"Daniel Bergner - Sing for Your Life 2016 RETAiL ePUB eBOOK-DiSTR","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
