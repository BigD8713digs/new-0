Much more than a parade of admirals and their battles, this is the story of how an insignificant island nation conquered the world&apos;s oceans to become its greatest trading empire. Yet, as Ben Wilson shows, there was nothing inevitable about this rise to maritime domination, nor was it ever an easy path. \r\n\r\nEMPIRE OF THE DEEP: THE RISE AND FALL OF THE BRITISH NAVY also reveals how our naval history has shaped us in more subtle and surprising ways - our language, culture, politics and national character all owe a great debt to this conquest of the seas. This is a gripping, fresh take on our national story.\r\n\r\nGenre: Non-Fiction &gt; History","last_updated":"2018-12-07T12:21:47.425Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e3d7e818f05d6b15245d9188091bd50c757d99e","dn":"Empire of the Deep by Ben Wilson (.ePUB) ","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"0e3d7e818f05d6b15245d9188091bd50c757d99e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,61,126,129,143,5,214,177,82,69,217,24,128,145,189,80,199,87,217,158]},"name":"Empire of the Deep by Ben Wilson (.ePUB) ","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
