Your goal is to optimize each initial layout to beat the target score, and to compete on the leaderboards, or against your personal best score. Progress through each level involves combining three types of particles with each other to ultimately create void. By manipulating the void optimally, you can achieve your goal of meeting or exceeding the target score specified for each particular level, indicating your mastery of that level. For extra challenge, attempt to reach the target score without any particle interaction with the void. You&apos;ll need to create your particles and voids at the right times and in the right places to reach your goal.Demo VersionPlay Jugo for","last_updated":"2017-07-02T12:01:15.377Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:c5afc3aa2bc3b8732f1b5f3d152660421b05eb3a","dn":"Fourtex Jugo","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"c5afc3aa2bc3b8732f1b5f3d152660421b05eb3a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,175,195,170,43,195,184,115,47,27,95,61,21,38,96,66,27,5,235,58]},"name":"Fourtex Jugo","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
