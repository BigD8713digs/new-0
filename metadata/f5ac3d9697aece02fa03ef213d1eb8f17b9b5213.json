Eddie&#x2019;s journey to heaven taught him that every life matters. Now, in this magical sequel, Mitch Albom reveals Annie&#x2019;s story.\n\nThe accident that killed Eddie left an indelible mark on Annie. It took her left hand, which needed to be surgically reattached. Injured, scarred, and unable to remember why, Annie&#x2019;s life is forever changed by a guilt-ravaged mother who whisks her away from the world she knew. Bullied by her peers and haunted by something she cannot recall, Annie struggles to find acceptance as she grows. When, as a young woman, she reconnects with Paulo, her childhood love, she believes she has finally found happiness.\n\nAs the novel opens, Annie is marrying Paulo. But when her wedding night day ends in an unimaginable accident, Annie finds herself on her own heavenly journey&#x2014;and an inevitable reunion with Eddie, one of the five people who will show her how her life mattered in ways she could not have fathomed.\n\nPoignant and beautiful, filled with unexpected twists, The Next Person You Meet in Heaven reminds us that not only does every life matter, but that every ending is also a beginning&#x2014;we only need to open our eyes to see it.\n\n <a href=\"\nhttps://pirates-forum.org/Forum-Requests\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://pirates-forum.org/Forum-Requests</a>\n","last_updated":"2018-10-10T12:10:43.699Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5ac3d9697aece02fa03ef213d1eb8f17b9b5213","dn":"Mitch Albom - The Next Person You Meet in Heaven (epub)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"f5ac3d9697aece02fa03ef213d1eb8f17b9b5213","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,172,61,150,151,174,206,2,250,3,239,33,61,30,184,241,123,155,82,19]},"name":"Mitch Albom - The Next Person You Meet in Heaven (epub)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
