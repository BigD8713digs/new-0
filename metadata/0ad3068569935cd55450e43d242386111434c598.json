He decamps to the isolated Scottish Isle of Jura in order to spend a few months in the cottage where George Orwell wrote most of his seminal novel, Nineteen Eighty-Four. Ray is miserable and quite prepared to make his troubles go away with the help of copious quantities of excellent scotch.\r\n\r\nBut a few of the local islanders take a decidedly shallow view of a foreigner coming to visit in order to sort himself out, and Ray quickly finds himself having to deal with not only his own issues but also a community whose eccentricities are at times amusing and at others downright dangerous. Also the locals believe - or claim to believe - that there&apos;s a werewolf about, and against his better judgment Ray&apos;s misadventures build to the night of a traditional boozy werewolf hunt on the Isle of Jura on the summer solstice.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-06-03T12:12:30.363Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ad3068569935cd55450e43d242386111434c598","dn":"Burning Down George Orwell's House by Andrew Ervin EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"0ad3068569935cd55450e43d242386111434c598","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,211,6,133,105,147,92,213,84,80,228,61,36,35,134,17,20,52,197,152]},"name":"Burning Down George Orwell's House by Andrew Ervin EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
