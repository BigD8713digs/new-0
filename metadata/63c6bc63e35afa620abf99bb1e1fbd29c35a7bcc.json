In the first ever memoir by a top-level operative to be authorized by the CIA, Antonio J. Mendez reveals the cunning tricks and insights that helped save hundreds from deadly situations.\r\n\r\nAdept at creating new identities for anyone, anywhere, Mendez was involved in operations all over the world, from &quot;Wild West&quot; adventures in East Asia to Cold War intrigue in Moscow.
