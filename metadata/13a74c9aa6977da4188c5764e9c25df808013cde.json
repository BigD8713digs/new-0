There the boy is given his first taste of power, picking which orphans eat first and which will be lent out for manual labor. Recognized for his loyalty and keen instincts, Jun Do comes to the attention of superiors in the state, rises in the ranks, and starts on a road from which there will be no return.\r\n\r\nConsidering himself &#x201C;a humble citizen of the greatest nation in the world,&#x201D; Jun Do becomes a professional kidnapper who must navigate the shifting rules, arbitrary violence, and baffling demands of his Korean overlords in order to stay alive. Driven to the absolute limit of what any human being could endure, he boldly takes on the treacherous role of rival to Kim Jong Il in an attempt to save the woman he loves, Sun Moon, a legendary actress &#x201C;so pure, she didn&#x2019;t know what starving people looked like.&#x201D;\r\n\r\nPart breathless thriller, part story of innocence lost, part story of romantic love, The Orphan Master&#x2019;s Son is also a riveting portrait of a world heretofore hidden from view: a North Korea rife with hunger, corruption, and casual cruelty but also camaraderie, stolen moments of beauty, and love. A towering literary achievement, The Orphan Master&#x2019;s Son ushers Adam Johnson into the small group of today&#x2019;s greatest writers.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-12-10T12:06:50.697Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:13a74c9aa6977da4188c5764e9c25df808013cde","dn":"The Orphan Master's Son by Adam Johnson EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"13a74c9aa6977da4188c5764e9c25df808013cde","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,167,76,154,166,151,125,164,24,140,87,100,233,194,93,248,8,1,60,222]},"name":"The Orphan Master's Son by Adam Johnson EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
