His Lancastrian queen, Margaret of Anjou, rides south with an army of victorious northerners, accompanied by painted warriors from the Scottish Highlands. With the death of York, Margaret and her army seem unstoppable.\r\nYet in killing the father, Margaret has unleashed the sons.\r\nEdward of March, now duke of York, proclaims himself England&apos;s rightful king. Factions form and tear apart as snow falls. Through blood and treason, through broken men and vengeful women, brother shall confront brother, king shall face king.\r\nTwo men can always claim a crown-but only one can keep it.\r\nFollowing Margaret of Anjou, Bloodline is the third epic installment in master storyteller Conn Iggulden&apos;s new Wars of the Roses series. Fans of the Game of Thrones and the Tudors series will be gripped from the word &quot;go.&quot;","last_updated":"2017-08-28T13:52:30.563Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:4849a57495dbf81738fbf5f8ee47a6df834201e1","dn":"Wars of the Roses: Bloodline  by Conn Iggulden - -MOBI/EPUB - ze","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"4849a57495dbf81738fbf5f8ee47a6df834201e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,73,165,116,149,219,248,23,56,251,245,248,238,71,166,223,131,66,1,225]},"name":"Wars of the Roses: Bloodline  by Conn Iggulden - -MOBI/EPUB - ze","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
