The ruined German capital lay 120 miles inside Soviet-controlled eastern Germany. Stalin wanted the Allies out; the Allies were determined to stay, but had only three narrow air corridors linking the city to the West. Stalin was confident he could crush Berlin&#x2019;s resolve by cutting off food and fuel.\r\n\r\nIn the USA, despite some voices still urging &#x2018;America first&#x2019;, it was believed that a rebuilt Germany was the best insurance against the spread of communism across Europe.\r\n\r\nAnd so over eleven months from June 1948 to May 1949, British and American aircraft carried out the most ambitious airborne relief operation ever mounted, flying over 2 million tons of supplies on almost 300,000 flights to save a beleaguered Berlin.\r\n\r\nWith new material from American, British and German archives and original interviews with veterans, Turner paints a fresh, vivid picture the airlift, whose repercussions &#x2013; the role of the USA as global leader, German ascendancy, Russian threat &#x2013; we are still living with today.\r\n\r\nBarry Turner is a celebrated historian, the author most recently of Karl Doenitz and the Last Days of the Third Reich (Icon, 2015), described as &#x2018;page-turning&#x2019; by the Daily Mail, and of Suez 1956 (Hodder, 2006) and, with Tony Rennell, of When Daddy Came Home (Arrow, 2014).\r\n\r\nHardcover: 320 pages\r\nPublisher: Icon Books Ltd (5 Oct. 2017)","last_updated":"2017-10-07T12:04:47.353Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:b79cb844361d1c0d77fea94f8358b09dae2820ae","dn":"The Berlin Airlift: Relief Operation that Defined the Cold War","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"b79cb844361d1c0d77fea94f8358b09dae2820ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,156,184,68,54,29,28,13,119,254,169,79,131,88,176,157,174,40,32,174]},"name":"The Berlin Airlift: Relief Operation that Defined the Cold War","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
