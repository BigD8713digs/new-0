Here are several demos of songs \r\nthat are on the albujm, as well as some outtakes of tracks that \r\ndid not make the album, and were never released. Although not \r\nquite up to Steely Dan standards (mainly due to Walter&apos;s limited \r\nvocals), there are several gems here, and this collection \r\nnonetheless displays Walter on his own, doing his own music. \r\nCertainly much in the same style as Steely Dan, but also some \r\nnotable differences, and well worth checking out Walter as \r\nseparate from Steely Dan.\r\n\r\nMUSICIANS\r\n Walter Becker - Bass, Solo Guitars, Ukulele, Vocals\r\n Dean Parks - Electric &amp; Acoustic Guitar \r\n Adam Rogers - Electric Guitar on Hat Too Flat\r\n Fima Ephron - Bass on Hat Too Flat\r\n Donald Fagen, John Beasley - Keyboards\r\n Ben Perowsky - Drums on Hat Too Flat\r\n Paulinho Da Costa - Percussion\r\n Backing Vocals - Katherine Russell, Brenda White-King \r\n Bob Sheppard - Saxophone, Woodwind Solos\r\n Bruce Paulson - Trombone\r\n Jon Papenbrook - Trumpet","last_updated":"2017-12-17T12:08:01.988Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:39190e7c069ad6803e1bec3bd846e9464022526e","dn":"Walter Becker - (Steely Dan) Demos and Outtakes 1994 SBD FLAC","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"39190e7c069ad6803e1bec3bd846e9464022526e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,25,14,124,6,154,214,128,62,27,236,59,216,70,233,70,64,34,82,110]},"name":"Walter Becker - (Steely Dan) Demos and Outtakes 1994 SBD FLAC","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
