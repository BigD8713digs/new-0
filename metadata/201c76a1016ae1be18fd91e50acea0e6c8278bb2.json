From a harrowingly cheerless childhood in Germany through acne-riddled high school years, and his adolescent discoveries of alcohol, women, and the Los Angeles Public Library&apos;s collection of D. H. Lawrence, Ham on Rye offers a crude, brutal, and savagely funny portrait of an outcast&apos;s coming-of-age during the desperate days of the Great Depression.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-07-10T12:00:52.405Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:201c76a1016ae1be18fd91e50acea0e6c8278bb2","dn":"Ham On Rye by Charles Bukowski epub RtR","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"201c76a1016ae1be18fd91e50acea0e6c8278bb2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,28,118,161,1,106,225,190,24,253,145,229,10,206,160,230,200,39,139,178]},"name":"Ham On Rye by Charles Bukowski epub RtR","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
