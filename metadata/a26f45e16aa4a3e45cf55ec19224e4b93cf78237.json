That&#x2019;s sort of odd, given the band&#x2019;s origins. RLYR started as a one-off collaboration of guitarist Trevor de Brauw, from post-metal act Pelican, and percussionist Steven Hess, from industrial/drone/experimental-suffering specialists Locrian; the two quickly discovered more lasting affinities, and they eventually recruited bassist Colin DeKuiper, who&#x2019;s spent significant time gigging with metal bands Russian Circles and Bloodiest. That&#x2019;s a whole lot of heavy and dark and unhappy. The record&#x2019;s surprisingly vibrant, buoyant and grand tones are forecast by the band&#x2019;s name: RLYR is a shout-out to the seventh record of progressive rock divines Yes. That might amount to a non-starter for those who have an allergic reaction to prog. It&#x2019;s an understandable affliction. But even if you break out in hives whenever you hear Jon Anderson&#x2019;s falsetto, RLYR&#x2019;s record deserves a listen. \r\nAll four songs are packed with diverting melodic gestures, ever-shifting rhythms, occasional tremolo breaks that wouldn&#x2019;t be entirely out of place in a Krallice tune. The record&#x2019;s second side is more athletic and more intense, and it features the better compositions. &#x201C;Vacancy&#x201D; and &#x201C;Artificial Horizons&#x201D; are both a mite shorter than the album&#x2019;s first two songs, and they&#x2019;re both more focused statements.\r\nTracklist: \r\n01 - Actual Existence.flac \r\n02 - L.Layer.flac \r\n03 - Artificial Horizons.flac \r\n04 - Vacancy.flac \r\n\r\nSummary: \r\nCountry: USA \r\nGenre: post-rock","last_updated":"2018-06-10T12:01:36.692Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:a26f45e16aa4a3e45cf55ec19224e4b93cf78237","dn":"[post-rock] (2018) RLYR - Actual Existence [FLAC,Tracks] {100.XY","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"a26f45e16aa4a3e45cf55ec19224e4b93cf78237","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,111,69,225,106,164,163,228,92,245,94,193,146,36,228,185,60,247,130,55]},"name":"[post-rock] (2018) RLYR - Actual Existence [FLAC,Tracks] {100.XY","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
