Yet, as recognizable as the bridge is, its builder is too often forgotten - and his life is of interest far beyond his chosen field. It is the story of immigrants, of the frontier, of the greatest crisis in American history, and of the making of the modern world. Forty years after the publication of The Great Bridge, David McCullough&apos;s classic chronicle of how the East River was spanned, Erica Wagner has written a fascinating biography of one of America&apos;s most distinguished engineers, a man whose long life was a model of courage in the face of extraordinary adversity. Chief Engineer is enriched by Roebling&apos;s own eloquent voice, unveiled in his recently discovered memoir that was previously thought lost to history.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-12-14T12:01:29.560Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:d69cf42f2917a2051c4113853c2844fd9bf3b8da","dn":"Chief Engineer_ Washington Roebling .. by Erica Wagner EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"d69cf42f2917a2051c4113853c2844fd9bf3b8da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,156,244,47,41,23,162,5,28,65,19,133,60,40,68,253,155,243,184,218]},"name":"Chief Engineer_ Washington Roebling .. by Erica Wagner EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
