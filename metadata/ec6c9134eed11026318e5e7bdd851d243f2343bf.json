It was developed by Team17. The game was the first in the series to be in 3D and also featured several new weapons. Additionally, some of the weapons operations are substantially different from previous Worms titles. And while it is rated T by the ESRB, which is a first for the series, it is rated 3+ by PEGI, which is also a first for the series. (Before, the games were rated 7+ or 12+) It is unknown why the ESRB chose the higher rating while PEGI chose the 3+ rating. The OS X version of the game was released in April 2004 by Feral Interactive.[1]","last_updated":"2018-07-22T12:00:57.524Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec6c9134eed11026318e5e7bdd851d243f2343bf","dn":"Worms 3D","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"ec6c9134eed11026318e5e7bdd851d243f2343bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,108,145,52,238,209,16,38,49,142,94,123,221,133,29,36,63,35,67,191]},"name":"Worms 3D","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
