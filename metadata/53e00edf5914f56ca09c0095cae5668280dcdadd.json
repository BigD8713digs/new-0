Adler&apos;s use of Laotian and Thai instruments and scales might smack of appropriation, as if he is exploiting exoticism for its own sake. Yet his music is so wholly absorbed with cycles, patterns, and modes that it is fair to say that his works are more adaptive to Asian culture than adoptive. Beyond his chosen techniques and idioms, Adler communicates emotions, though in a rather private manner, and shades his music with subdued lyricism and tremulous feeling. His performances on the khaen -- a Laotian reed organ that produces melodies, chords, and drones -- are the most personally expressive, as may be discerned in The Wind Blows Inside, and even more strongly and poignantly in Epilogue for a Dark Day. Three Lai for violin, viola, and khaen is the most Western sounding for its dance rhythms and fairly conventional string writing. The two ensemble pieces -- Signals Intelligence for six percussionists, and Pan-lom (Essays on Architecture I) for winds, strings, and percussion -- are reminiscent of gamelan music, and may be the most appealing for their delicate complexity and mystery. Tzadik&apos;s recorded sound is superb. - Blair Sanderson, AMG","last_updated":"2017-07-16T12:01:23.096Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:53e00edf5914f56ca09c0095cae5668280dcdadd","dn":"Christopher Adler 2004 Epilogue For A Dark Day","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"53e00edf5914f56ca09c0095cae5668280dcdadd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,224,14,223,89,20,245,108,160,156,0,149,202,229,102,130,128,220,218,221]},"name":"Christopher Adler 2004 Epilogue For A Dark Day","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
