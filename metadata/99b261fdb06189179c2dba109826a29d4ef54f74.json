Nina, a lonely real-estate broker estranged from her only relative, is at the center of a web of stories connecting fractured communities and families. She moves through the houses of L.A.&apos;s wealthy and elite and finds men and women both crass and tender, vicious, and desperate. With wit and intellect, Millet offers profound insight into human behavior from the ordinary to the bizarre: strong-minded girls are beset by the helpless; myopic executives are tormented by their employees; and beastly men do beastly things. \r\n\r\nFresh off the critical triumph of Sweet Lamb of Heaven (longlisted for the National Book Award), Millet is pioneering a new kind of satire - compassionate toward its victims and hilariously brutal in its depiction of modern American life.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-07-01T12:13:06.729Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:99b261fdb06189179c2dba109826a29d4ef54f74","dn":"Fight No More: Stories by Lydia Millet EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"99b261fdb06189179c2dba109826a29d4ef54f74","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,178,97,253,176,97,137,23,156,45,186,16,152,38,162,157,78,245,79,116]},"name":"Fight No More: Stories by Lydia Millet EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
