His unique readings of literature, literary theory, continental philosophy, political thought, religious studies, and art have made him one of the most innovative thinkers of our time, and his work has had a deep impact on contemporary scholarship across a number of disciplines.\n\nMuch of his work since the 1980s can be viewed as leading up to the so-called Homo Sacer (&quot;sacred man&quot;) project that properly begins with HOMO SACER: SOVEREIGN POWER AND BARE LIFE (1995).  This project, currently numbering 9 volumes, is a series of ongoing and interconnected investigations of staggering ambition and scope investigating the deepest foundations of every major Western institution and discourse.  Each volume takes a seemingly obscure and outdated issue as its starting point &#x2014; an enigmatic figure in Roman law, or medieval debates about God&apos;s management of creation, or theories about the origin of the oath &#x2014; but is always guided by questions with urgent contemporary relevance.\n\nWhile his overall analysis in the project is highly critical of the contemporary state and its apparatuses, his conclusion is not one of complete despair.  Rather, the means for overcoming the aporias of the modern democratic state lie precisely within the heart of the crisis itself.  To the project of such an overcoming, he gives the name &#x201C;coming politics,&#x201D; a politics of pure means, an idea first developed in THE COMING COMMUNITY (1990) and MEANS WITHOUT END (1996).  Such a new politics would require the formulation of a new form of life, wherein bare life is not separable as a political subject and what is at stake is the experience of community itself.\n\n\nThe following books are in PDF format unless otherwise indicated:\n\n* Adventure, The (MIT, 2018).
