Jarreau&#x2019;s still in fine form as a writer, too, and the lite funk of &#x201C;Have You Seen the Child&#x201D; and &#x201C;Milwaukee&#x201D; is just as appealing, while the acapella original &#x201C;Hold on Me&#x201D; is a dazzling vocal showcase for Jarreau, who&#x2019;s multi-tracked here and provides all the voices and percussive effects. The biggest standout, though, is his cover of the relatively obscure Sly &amp; the Family Stone song &#x201C;Somebody&#x2019;s Watching You&#x201D; (an album cut from Stand!), which he makes all his own.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTracklist:\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n1.
