Way too often these days new English cam releases are getting harder and harder to find without having to wait 1-2 months after first theater releases.\r\n\r\nMy apologies for the parts where it gets so loud the audio washes out (doesnt happen often though).  The damn theater speakers were so loud that even in person they too were making the same washed out sounds.  Chill guys and turn down the volume.
