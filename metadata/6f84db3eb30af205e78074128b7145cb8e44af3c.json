Despite his hard work and genuine concern for the disadvantaged, he has struggled to overcome his unpopularity. After Diana&apos;s death, his approval rating crashed to 4 percent and has been rescued only by his marriage to Camilla. Nevertheless, just one-third of Britons now support him to be the next king. \r\n\r\nMany still fear that his accession to the throne will cause a constitutional crisis. That mistrust climaxed in the aftermath of the trial of Paul Burrell, Diana&apos;s butler, acquitted after the Queen&apos;s sensational &apos;recollection&apos;. In unearthing many secrets surrounding that and many other dramas, Bower&apos;s book, relying on the testimony from over 120 people employed or welcomed into the inner sanctum of Clarence House, reveals a royal household rife with intrigue and misconduct. The result is a book which uniquely will probe into the character and court of the Charles that no one, until now, has seen. \r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-05-14T12:00:59.569Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f84db3eb30af205e78074128b7145cb8e44af3c","dn":"Rebel Prince by Tom Bower MOBI","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"6f84db3eb30af205e78074128b7145cb8e44af3c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,132,219,62,179,10,242,5,231,128,116,18,139,113,69,203,142,68,175,60]},"name":"Rebel Prince by Tom Bower MOBI","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
