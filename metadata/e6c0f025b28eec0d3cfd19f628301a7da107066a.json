He writes about his sexual encounters - both strange and intimate - alongside stories from his childhood and his tell-all experiences with &quot;science drugs&quot;. Throughout it all, Jude is critical of himself and his actions, proving himself to be vulnerable, lonely, and extremely relatable. A stellar follow-up to Hyena.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-09-16T12:15:22.586Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6c0f025b28eec0d3cfd19f628301a7da107066a","dn":"Hummingbird by Jude Angelini EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"e6c0f025b28eec0d3cfd19f628301a7da107066a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,192,240,37,178,142,236,13,60,253,25,246,40,48,26,125,161,7,6,106]},"name":"Hummingbird by Jude Angelini EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
