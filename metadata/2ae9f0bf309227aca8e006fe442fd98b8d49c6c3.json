However, their opinionated next-door neighbor Calvin Butler is wary of the newcomers, certain that they&apos;ll disrupt the culture on the block. Dave realizes that fitting in with the new community is more complex than he had expected, but if he can find a way to connect with Calvin, there&apos;s an excellent chance of making the new neighborhood a great place to live","last_updated":"2018-11-13T12:59:57.118Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ae9f0bf309227aca8e006fe442fd98b8d49c6c3","dn":"The.Neighborhood.S01E07.720p.HDTV.x264.[211MB].[MP4]","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"2ae9f0bf309227aca8e006fe442fd98b8d49c6c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,233,240,191,48,146,39,172,168,224,6,254,68,47,217,139,141,73,198,195]},"name":"The.Neighborhood.S01E07.720p.HDTV.x264.[211MB].[MP4]","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
