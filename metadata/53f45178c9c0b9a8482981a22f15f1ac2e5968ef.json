This show was limitted to only 600 people. Tickets weren&apos;t sold. You could only win them during a lottery in the radio or a few websites. Too bad a lot of people were unlucky enough to stay at home, including myself. Fortunately, the concert was broadcast live. Still great. I connected my radio with an instrument cable through my guitar Preamp into my PCs soundcard.\r\n\r\n Meanwhile In 2017, the band released a single, &quot;Run&quot;, and announced their ninth studio album, Concrete and Gold, which is scheduled for release on September 15, 2017.\r\nWhile we wait ...\r\n\r\nTracklist Disk 1\r\n\r\n01.
