The book about that trip, Notes from a Small Island, is uproarious and endlessly endearing, one of the most acute and affectionate portrayals of England in all its glorious eccentricity ever written. Two decades later, he set out again to rediscover that country, and the result is The Road to Little Dribbling. Nothing is funnier than Bill Bryson on the road; prepare for the total joy and multiple episodes of unseemly laughter.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-01-25T12:09:23.127Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:56504a84d6e1372534104e7be93cb105a42a1570","dn":"The Road to Little Dribbling by Bill Bryson EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"56504a84d6e1372534104e7be93cb105a42a1570","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,80,74,132,214,225,55,37,52,16,78,123,233,60,177,5,164,42,21,112]},"name":"The Road to Little Dribbling by Bill Bryson EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
