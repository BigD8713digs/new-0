All she knows is that she&apos;s somehow conscious - and not only that, she&apos;s able to sense who around her is hiding a murderous past.\r\n\r\nIn life, Breezy was always drawn to the elegance of the universe and the mystery of the stars. Now she must set out to find answers and discover what is to become of her in the gritty, dangerous world to which she now belongs - where killers hide in plain sight and a sinister cult is hunting for strange creatures like her. What she finds is at once empowering, redemptive, and dangerous.\r\n\r\nTense, complex, and wholly engaging, Shallow Graves is a stunning first novel from Kali Wallace.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-03-13T12:04:02.401Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:195137a487b44292954f81f5e780d88297f54955","dn":"Shallow Graves by Kali Wallace EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"195137a487b44292954f81f5e780d88297f54955","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,81,55,164,135,180,66,146,149,79,129,245,231,128,216,130,151,245,73,85]},"name":"Shallow Graves by Kali Wallace EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
