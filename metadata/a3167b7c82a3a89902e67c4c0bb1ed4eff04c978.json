But Meg knows that the glow of their very public life hides a darker reality of lies, manipulation, and the heartbreak of her own solitary childhood. Desperate to break free of her mother, Meg accepts a proposal to write a scandalous, tell-all memoir.\r\n\r\nDigging into the past - and her mother&apos;s cult classic - draws Meg to Bonny Island, Georgia, and an unusual woman said to be the inspiration for the book. At first island life seems idyllic, but as Meg starts to ask tough questions, disturbing revelations come to light...including some about her mother.\r\n\r\nSoon Meg&apos;s search leads her to question the facts of a decades-old murder. She&apos;s warned to leave it alone, but as the lies pile up, Meg knows she&apos;s getting close to finding a murderer. When her own life is threatened, Meg realizes the darkness found in her mother&apos;s book is nothing compared to the chilling truth that lurks off the page.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-08-30T12:02:10.441Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:a3167b7c82a3a89902e67c4c0bb1ed4eff04c978","dn":"The Weight of Lies_ A Novel by Emily Carpenter ePUB eBOOK-ZAK","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"a3167b7c82a3a89902e67c4c0bb1ed4eff04c978","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,22,123,124,130,163,168,153,2,230,124,76,11,177,237,78,255,4,201,120]},"name":"The Weight of Lies_ A Novel by Emily Carpenter ePUB eBOOK-ZAK","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
