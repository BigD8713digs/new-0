A former model and Bond girl, her distinctive voice has been supplied for animated characters, film narration and AOL&apos;s &quot;You&apos;ve got mail&quot; notification in the UK. She has spoken out as a human rights activist for Survival International and the recent Gurkha Justice Campaign, and is now considered a &apos;national treasure&apos; of Nepal as well as the UK because of her support. She is also an advocate for a huge number of charities. \r\n\r\nShe has won two BAFTA awards, but it is the sheer diversity of her life that has made her so compelling a personality - early years in Kashmir and Malaya, growing up in Kent, then a photographic model before becoming an actress, appearing in a huge range of roles, whether it is the Nimble bread TV ad, movies like ON HER MAJESTY&apos;S SECRET SERVICE, dramas like SENSITIVE SKIN and documentaries on the Northern Lights, Bhutan and the Nile, and of course as the unforgettable Patsy in ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS or as Purdy in THE NEW AVENGERS, where her plummy vowels and upper-class demeanour has made her one of our most recognisable actors.\r\n\r\nGenre: Non-Fiction &gt; Biographies &amp; Memoirs","last_updated":"2018-09-27T12:24:58.197Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:97e8ffd10d71a4d2362fb8566c1cf40b09c52c65","dn":"Absolutely: A Memoir by Joanna Lumley&nbsp; (.epub)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"97e8ffd10d71a4d2362fb8566c1cf40b09c52c65","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,232,255,209,13,113,164,210,54,47,184,86,108,28,244,11,9,197,44,101]},"name":"Absolutely: A Memoir by Joanna Lumley&nbsp; (.epub)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
