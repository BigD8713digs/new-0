But no matter which force is winning, in the apocalypse, a sword will always work.\r\n\r\nHugh d&apos;Ambray, Preceptor of the Iron Dogs, Warlord of the Builder of Towers, served only one man. Now his immortal, nearly omnipotent master has cast him aside. Hugh is a shadow of the warrior he was, but when he learns that the Iron Dogs, soldiers who would follow him anywhere, are being hunted down and murdered, he must make a choice: to fade away or to be the leader he was born to be. Hugh knows he must carve a new place for himself and his people, but they have no money, no shelter, and no food, and the necromancers are coming. Fast.\r\n\r\nElara Harper is a creature who should not exist. Her enemies call her Abomination; her people call her White Lady. Tasked with their protection, she&apos;s trapped between the magical heavyweights about to collide and plunge the state of Kentucky into a war that humans have no power to stop. Desperate to shield her people and their simple way of life, she would accept help from the devil himself - and Hugh d&apos;Ambray might qualify.\r\n\r\nHugh needs a base; Elara needs soldiers. Both are infamous for betraying their allies, so how can they create a believable alliance to meet the challenge of their enemies? \r\n\r\nAs the prophet says, &quot;It is better to marry than to burn&quot;. \r\n\r\nHugh and Elara may do both. \r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-09-11T12:01:59.583Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:48081f63253406d56893fe021a5e53c5cca88491","dn":"Iron and Magic (Iron Covenant, Book 1) by Ilona Andrews EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"48081f63253406d56893fe021a5e53c5cca88491","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,8,31,99,37,52,6,213,104,147,254,2,26,94,83,197,204,168,132,145]},"name":"Iron and Magic (Iron Covenant, Book 1) by Ilona Andrews EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
