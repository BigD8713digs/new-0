The old guys had their mothballs dusted off and were trotted out for the new, pre-rock &apos;n&apos; roll folkies of the time, and a revival was born. Now, in the new millennium, this stuff sounds as fresh and hot (or cool, as the case may be) as it did in the decades before it was recorded. These guys aren&apos;t around anymore, but you can still listen to the REAL blues, as it was, as it is, as it should be.
