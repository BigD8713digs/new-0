In Operation Shylock, master novelist Philip Roth confronts his double, an impostor whose self-appointed task is to lead the Jews back to Europe from Israel. The &quot;fake&quot; Philip Roth becomes a monstrous nemesis to the &quot;real&quot; Philip Roth, who must take a frightening and mysterious journey through the volatile Middle East. Suspenseful, hilarious, and impassioned, Operation Shylock is at once a spy story, a political thriller, and a confession, pulsing with intelligence and intense narrative energy.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-07-08T12:00:20.541Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:5021a1674dd81292b038f539ed7828665db299e4","dn":"Operation Shylock by Philip Roth epub RtR","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"5021a1674dd81292b038f539ed7828665db299e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,33,161,103,77,216,18,146,176,56,245,57,237,120,40,102,93,178,153,228]},"name":"Operation Shylock by Philip Roth epub RtR","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
