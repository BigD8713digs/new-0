The series explores the impact of racism on a global scale and chronicles the shifts in the perception of race and the history of racism in Europe, the Americas, Australia and Asia. The series was narrated by Sophie Okonedo...\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nThe series was researched and prepared by the BBC to mark the 200th anniversary of the abolition of slavery in Britain (which did not abolish slavery itself) and consists of a chronology of events beginning with the invention of the concept of race in the 17th century as a result of colonisation and slavery and ending in the continued struggle for equal rights that still goes on. The story line narrated by Sophie Okonedo is illustrated by photographs, dramatic representations and on-site filming and is liberally interspersed with interviews with leading researchers and witnesses","last_updated":"2018-07-03T12:12:07.980Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd6d300be4f2068d018fec4b105c08c816a17522","dn":"Racism: A History - complete 3 parts combined in 1 video","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"cd6d300be4f2068d018fec4b105c08c816a17522","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,109,48,11,228,242,6,141,1,143,236,75,16,92,8,200,22,161,117,34]},"name":"Racism: A History - complete 3 parts combined in 1 video","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
