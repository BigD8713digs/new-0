The American experiment rests on three ideas&#x2014;&quot;these truths,&quot; Jefferson called them&#x2014;political equality, natural rights, and the sovereignty of the people. And it rests, too, on a fearless dedication to inquiry, Lepore argues, because self-government depends on it. But has the nation, and democracy itself, delivered on that promise?\r\n\r\nGenre: Non-Fiction &gt; History","last_updated":"2018-09-20T12:14:46.044Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:57d4263a8a0844f8ada390f87164568a37256915","dn":"These Truths: A History of the U.S. by Jill Lepore (.epub)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"57d4263a8a0844f8ada390f87164568a37256915","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,212,38,58,138,8,68,248,173,163,144,248,113,100,86,138,55,37,105,21]},"name":"These Truths: A History of the U.S. by Jill Lepore (.epub)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
