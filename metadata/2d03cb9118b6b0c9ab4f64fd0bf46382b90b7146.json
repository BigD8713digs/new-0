Still, like everything else in the Budayeen, he&apos;s available for a price.\r\n\r\nFor a new kind of killer roams the streets of the Arab ghetto, a madman whose bootlegged personality cartridges range from a sinister James Bond to a sadistic disemboweler named Khan. And Marid Audrian has been made an offer he can&apos;t refuse.The 200-year-old godfather of the Budayeen&apos;s underworld has enlisted Marid as his instrument of vengeance. But first Marid must undergo the most sophisticated of surgical implants before he dares to confront a killer who carries the power of every psychopath since the beginning of time.\r\n\r\nWry, savage, and unignorable, When Gravity Fails was hailed as a classic by Effinger&apos;s fellow SF writers on its original publication in 1987, and the sequence of Marid Audrian novels it begins were the culmination of his career.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-07-31T12:01:28.731Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d03cb9118b6b0c9ab4f64fd0bf46382b90b7146","dn":"When Gravity Fails (Marid Audran series_book 1) by George Alec E","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"2d03cb9118b6b0c9ab4f64fd0bf46382b90b7146","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,3,203,145,24,182,176,201,171,79,100,253,11,244,99,130,185,11,113,70]},"name":"When Gravity Fails (Marid Audran series_book 1) by George Alec E","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
