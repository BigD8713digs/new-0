Popular Science has won over 58 awards, including the American Society of Magazine Editors awards for its journalistic excellence in both 2003 (for General Excellence) and 2004 (for Best Magazine Section). With roots beginning in 1872, Popular Science has been translated into over 30 languages and is distributed to at least 45 countries.\r\nThe Popular Science Monthly, as the publication was originally called, was founded in May 1872 by Edward L. Youmans to disseminate scientific knowledge to the educated layman. Youmans had previously worked as an editor for the weekly Appleton&apos;s Journal and persuaded them to publish his new journal. Early issues were mostly reprints of English periodicals. The journal became an outlet for writings and ideas of Charles Darwin, Thomas Henry Huxley, Louis Pasteur, Henry Ward Beecher, Charles Sanders Peirce, William James, Thomas Edison, John Dewey and James McKeen Cattell. William Jay Youmans, Edward&apos;s brother, helped found Popular Science Monthly in 1872 and was an editor as well. He became editor-in-chief on Edward&apos;s death in 1887.The publisher, D. Appleton &amp; Company, was forced for economic reasons to sell the journal in 1900","last_updated":"2017-07-30T12:03:58.795Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ab8aba2628002410c32615830c2e75cdddd6de7","dn":"Popular Science USA - September-October 2017 - PDF - zeke23","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"6ab8aba2628002410c32615830c2e75cdddd6de7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,184,171,162,98,128,2,65,12,50,97,88,48,194,231,92,221,221,109,231]},"name":"Popular Science USA - September-October 2017 - PDF - zeke23","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
