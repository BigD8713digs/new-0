In his new book, The Synchronicity Key, David Wilcock embarks on an astonishing investigation into what lies beyond this new understanding of how our universe works - finding proof that everything in our lives is not only connected, but it also all influences everything else.\r\n\r\nUsing history, astrology, and synchronicity theory as well as concepts such as fractals, spiritual geometry, quantum physics, and other new research, Wilcock shows that there is a hidden architecture within time, guiding individuals and nations through a system of enlightenment Joseph Campbell called the Hero&#x2019;s Journey. Historical events occur in shockingly precise, repeating cycles of time as a result. Once we understand and identify the hidden laws governing the fates of individuals and nations through seemingly random &quot;synchronicity&quot;, we are left with a remarkable blueprint of how best to lead our lives in this uncertain and confusing world.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-10-25T12:00:46.253Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5a86e1f872add9b854ff8067fc09b7e3f27010f","dn":"The Synchronicity Key by David Wilcock EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"b5a86e1f872add9b854ff8067fc09b7e3f27010f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,168,110,31,135,42,221,155,133,79,248,6,127,192,155,126,63,39,1,15]},"name":"The Synchronicity Key by David Wilcock EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
