Have you ever felt like you aren&apos;t where you are supposed to be and wondered how the people around you managed to find their purposes in life?\r\n\r\nAfter realizing that his well-paying, prestigious job was actually making him miserable, Adam &quot;Smiley&quot; Poswolsky started asking these big questions: How do you actually find meaning in the workplace? How do you find work that makes your heart sing, creates impact, and pays your rent?\r\n\r\nIn The Quarter-Life Breakthrough, Smiley provides fresh, honest, counterintuitive, and inspiring career advice for anyone stuck in a quarter-life crisis (or third-life crisis), trying to figure out what to do with their lives. He shares the stories of many 20- and 30-somethings who are discovering how to work with purpose (and still pay the bills). With practical exercises and advice, this book is essential reading for career changers and anyone passionate about getting unstuck, pursuing work that matters, and changing the world.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-11-04T12:02:12.142Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:a744ce150e654daa8bb108fbf176901d94a840b5","dn":"The Quarter-Life Breakthrough by Adam Smiley Poswolsky EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"a744ce150e654daa8bb108fbf176901d94a840b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,68,206,21,14,101,77,170,139,177,8,251,241,118,144,29,148,168,64,181]},"name":"The Quarter-Life Breakthrough by Adam Smiley Poswolsky EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
