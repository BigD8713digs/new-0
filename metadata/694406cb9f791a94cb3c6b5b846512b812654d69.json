This season&apos;s theme, &quot;Heroes v. Healers v. Hustlers,&quot; sees the contestants separated into three tribes based on how they are perceived by others -- those heralded for their achievements, those who receive gratitude for their work and those who must earn the respect of others -- as they vie to outwit, outplay and outlast one another. This round of castaways includes a professional football player, a nurse practitioner and a diversity advocate. In the end, one castaway earns the title of Sole Survivor.\r\n\r\nFirst episode date: 31 May 2000\r\nStarring: Survivor contestants\r\nPresented by: Jeff Probst\r\nTheme song: Survivor Theme Song","last_updated":"2017-12-21T12:03:52.881Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:694406cb9f791a94cb3c6b5b846512b812654d69","dn":"Survivor.S35E15.720p.HDTV.x264.[422MB]","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"694406cb9f791a94cb3c6b5b846512b812654d69","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,68,6,203,159,121,26,148,203,60,107,91,132,101,18,184,18,101,77,105]},"name":"Survivor.S35E15.720p.HDTV.x264.[422MB]","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
