Zill\r\nJones &amp; Bartlett Learning | September 2016 | ISBN-10: 1284105903 | PDF | 1024 pages | 16.6 mb\r\n\r\nModern and comprehensive, the new sixth edition of award-winning author, Dennis G. Zill&#x2019;s Advanced Engineering Mathematics is a compendium of topics that are most often covered in courses in engineering mathematics, and is extremely flexible to meet the unique needs of courses ranging from ordinary differential equations, to vector calculus, to partial differential equations. A key strength of this best-selling text is the author&#x2019;s emphasis on differential equations as mathematical models, discussing the constructs and pitfalls of each. An accessible writing style and robust pedagogical aids guide students through difficult concepts with thoughtful explanations, clear examples, interesting applications, and contributed project problems.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\nPreface\r\nPART 1 Ordinary Differential Equations 1\r\n1 Introduction to Differential Equations 3\r\n2 First-Order Differential Equations 33\r\n3 Higher-Order Differential Equations 105\r\n4 The Laplace Transform 211\r\n5 Series Solutions of Linear Differential Equations 261\r\n6 Numerical Solutions of Ordinary Differential Equations 297\r\nPART 2 Vectors, Matrices, and Vector Calculus 319\r\n7 Vectors 321\r\n8 Matrices 367\r\n9 Vector Calculus 479\r\nPART 3 Systems of Differential Equations 589\r\n10 Systems of Linear Differential Equations 591\r\n11 Systems of Nonlinear Differential Equations 629\r\nPART 4 Partial Differential Equations 669\r\n12 Orthogonal Functions and Fourier Series 671\r\n13 Boundary-Value Problems in Rectangular Coordinates 707\r\n14 Boundary-Value Problems in Other Coordinate Systems 747\r\n15 Integral Transform Method 767\r\n16 Numerical Solutions of Partial Differential Equations 801\r\nPART 5 Complex Analysis 817\r\n17 Functions of a Complex Variable 819\r\n18 Integration in the Complex Plane 853\r\n19 Series and Residues 877\r\n20 Conformal Mappings 911\r\nAppendices\r\nI Derivative and Integral Formulas APP-2\r\nII Gamma Function APP-4\r\nIII Table of Laplace Transforms APP-6\r\nIV Conformal Mappings APP-9\r\nAnswers to Selected Odd-Numbered Problems ANS-1\r\nIndex I-1\r\n <a href=\"\nhttps://s26.postimg.org/6r4ged4c9/Advanced_Engineering_Mathematics_6th_Ed.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://s26.postimg.org/6r4ged4c9/Advanced_Engineering_Mathematics_6th_Ed.jpg</a>","last_updated":"2017-09-16T12:06:44.538Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:64f1b08083e3ea3a98c38b311e5fa2cdb38682a7","dn":"Advanced Engineering Mathematics (6th Ed)(gnv64)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"64f1b08083e3ea3a98c38b311e5fa2cdb38682a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,241,176,128,131,227,234,58,152,195,139,49,30,95,162,205,179,134,130,167]},"name":"Advanced Engineering Mathematics (6th Ed)(gnv64)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
