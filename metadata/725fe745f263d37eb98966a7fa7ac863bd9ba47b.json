Since taking over Ribble Reclamation, new owner Paul has implemented some big changes, investing a million pounds into the company and trebling the stock. He now has his two daughters working for him with high hopes that they&#x2019;ll take over the business in the future. His old friend and yard manager Dale continues to be a thorn in Paul&#x2019;s side as he tries to shift the focus away from buying and selling the antiques that Dale knows and loves so well, and instead concentrate on the big deals that can come from Paul&#x2019;s demolition business. At Beeston Reclamation owner Trevor and his younger brother Lee try and make every little deal count. But as Chief Buyer, Lee more often than not finds himself in hot water over items that he buys for the yard that Trevor considers a waste of his money. With all these relationships put under strain who will survive the pressures of another year in business?","last_updated":"2017-05-25T11:01:39.356Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:725fe745f263d37eb98966a7fa7ac863bd9ba47b","dn":"Seeking Salvage History Channel","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"725fe745f263d37eb98966a7fa7ac863bd9ba47b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,95,231,69,242,99,211,126,185,137,102,167,250,122,200,99,189,155,164,123]},"name":"Seeking Salvage History Channel","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
