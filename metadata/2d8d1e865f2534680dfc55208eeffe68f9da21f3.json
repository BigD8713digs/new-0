This is the extended version, with extra scenes. \r\n\r\nI clipped the video to its 1920 x 800 size, and used x265 2.63 to create a VBR in 2 passes, at an average of 2000 and peak of 3200kbps, using the &quot;veryslow&quot; preset, which is the second highest quality setting.\r\n\r\nIt took my spare AMD PC  almost 3 weeks to encode both parts.\r\n\r\nI did not join the two parts; enjoy the movie as originally released, but without the need to change discs! \r\n\r\nI think that x265 has done a very good job, creating the movie at very high quality, in 4.55Gb, a fraction of the original size. \r\n\r\nIf you observe the first few seconds of the second part, note the smoke on the far bank. On some other, lesser quality uploads of this movie, the smoke is horribly pixellated. Far too many HEVC uploaders use too little bandwidth. \r\n\r\nThe English, Italiano, Fran&#xE7;ais and Espa&#xF1;ol subtitles are included (soft coded). \r\n\r\nEnjoy, and please, please, continue to seed after you have downloaded. \r\n\r\nVideo: 1920 x 800p |  23.976 fps | h265 10 Bit LE | Chroma 4:2:0 | Bitrate 2000 Kbps average, max 3200 kbps \r\nAudio: AAC 5.1 | 448 kbps \r\nSubtitles:  Subrip SRT | UTF-8 \r\n\r\nScreens:-\r\n <a href=\"\nhttps://postimg.cc/QFqBYRv8/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://postimg.cc/QFqBYRv8/</a> <a href=\"\nhttps://postimg.cc/bZ06CwzZ/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://postimg.cc/bZ06CwzZ/</a> <a href=\"\nhttps://postimg.cc/py1BKsh8/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://postimg.cc/py1BKsh8/</a>","last_updated":"2018-11-19T12:18:43.487Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d8d1e865f2534680dfc55208eeffe68f9da21f3","dn":"The  Lord of the Rings The Return of the King Extended (2003)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"2d8d1e865f2534680dfc55208eeffe68f9da21f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,141,30,134,95,37,52,104,13,252,85,32,142,239,254,104,249,218,33,243]},"name":"The  Lord of the Rings The Return of the King Extended (2003)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
