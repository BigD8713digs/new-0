Originally penned by the late Derek C. Hutchinson, an international authority on sea kayaking, it describes equipment, basic and advanced techniques, weather and navigation, and is illustrated throughout by the author&apos;s own drawings and color photographs.\r\nThis new 40th anniversary edition has been completely updated in line with the latest sea kayaking developments by Wayne Horodowich, a longtime friend of Hutchinson&apos;s and the founder of University of Sea Kayaking.\r\n\r\nAbout the Author <a href=\"\nhttps://s22.postimg.cc/avec1rwtt/Derek_C._Hutchinson.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://s22.postimg.cc/avec1rwtt/Derek_C._Hutchinson.jpg</a>\r\nThe late Derek Hutchinson had long been regarded as an international authority on sea kayaking. Current author Wayne Horodowich, a disciple of Derek Hutchinson&#x2019;s teachings and a close friend, is the two-time former captain of the US Surf Kayaking Team&#x2019;s world championship teams. Together with Hutchinson, he taught sea kayaking clinics across the country, including many attached to Outward Bound programs.
