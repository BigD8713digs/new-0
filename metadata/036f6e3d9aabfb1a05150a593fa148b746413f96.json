One Christian. Twenty Controversial Questions.- John W. Loftus, Randal Rauser\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most persistent question in human history is whether or not there is a God. Intelligent people on both sides of the issue have argued, sometimes with deep rancor and bitterness, for generations. The issue can&apos;t be decided by another apologetics book, but the conversation can continue and help each side understand the perspectives of the other.\r\n\r\nIn this unique book, atheist John Loftus and theist Randal Rauser engage in twenty short debates that consider Christianity, the existence of God, and unbelief from a variety of angles. Each concise debate centers on a proposition to be resolved, with either John or Randal arguing in the affirmative and the opponent the negative, and can be read in short bits or big bites. This is the perfect book for Christians and their atheist or agnostic friends to read together, and encourages honest, open, and candid debate on the most important issues of life and faith.\r\n\r\nPlease seed.  Thanks!","last_updated":"2018-06-03T12:09:55.799Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:036f6e3d9aabfb1a05150a593fa148b746413f96","dn":"God or Godless?: One Atheist. One Christian.
