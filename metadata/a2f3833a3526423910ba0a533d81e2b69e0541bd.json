The secretive, Klan-like group was executing a wicked plan of terror, murdering enemies, flogging associates, and contemplating armed rebellion. The Legion boasted tens of thousands of members across the Midwest, among them politicians and prominent citizens - even, possibly, a beloved athlete.\r\n\r\nTerror in the City of Champions opens with the arrival of Mickey Cochrane, a fiery baseball star who roused the Great Depression&apos;s hardest-hit city by leading the Tigers to the 1934 pennant. A year later he guided the team to its first championship. Within seven months the Lions and Red Wings follow in football and hockey - all while Joe Louis chased boxing&apos;s heavyweight crown.\r\n\r\nAmidst such glory, the Legion&apos;s dreadful toll grew unchecked: staged &quot;suicides&quot;, bodies dumped along roadsides, high-profile assassination plots. Talkative Dayton Dean&apos;s involvement would deepen as heroic Mickey Cochrane&apos;s reputation would rise. But the ballplayer had his own demons, including a close friendship with Harry Bennett, Henry Ford&apos;s brutal union buster.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-12-02T12:00:49.160Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2f3833a3526423910ba0a533d81e2b69e0541bd","dn":"Terror in the City of Champions by Tom Stanton EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"a2f3833a3526423910ba0a533d81e2b69e0541bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,243,131,58,53,38,66,57,16,186,10,83,61,129,226,182,158,5,65,189]},"name":"Terror in the City of Champions by Tom Stanton EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
