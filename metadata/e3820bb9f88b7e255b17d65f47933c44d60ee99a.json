Yet, as science journalist Dave Levitan reveals, that line is just the tip of the melting iceberg when it comes to rhetorical tools wielded to attack scientific findings that don&apos;t cooperate with political agendas. Just listen to Mike Huckabee dismiss climate change as &quot;a sunburn&quot;, Donald Trump suggest that vaccines cause autism, or Todd Akin&apos;s infamous invention of &quot;legitimate rape&quot;.\r\n\r\nWith a taxonomer&apos;s eye, Levitan captures and categorizes these deceptions by chapter, assigning delightful names like &quot;The Butter-Up and Undercut&quot;, &quot;The Literal Nitpick&quot;, &quot;The Straight-Up Fabrication&quot;, and many more. His sharp-elbowed humor dismantles our leaders&apos; deceptive arguments while illuminating the real science behind the worst soundbites from our elected non-scientists.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-09-17T12:01:50.475Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3820bb9f88b7e255b17d65f47933c44d60ee99a","dn":"Not a Scientist_ How Politicians Mistake, Misrepresent, and Utte","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"e3820bb9f88b7e255b17d65f47933c44d60ee99a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,130,11,185,248,139,126,37,91,23,214,95,71,147,60,68,214,14,233,154]},"name":"Not a Scientist_ How Politicians Mistake, Misrepresent, and Utte","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
