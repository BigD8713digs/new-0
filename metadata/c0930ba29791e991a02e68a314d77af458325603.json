She describes it as a characteristically female way of thinking that appears to be contradictory and circuitous but is actually a complicated and highly evolved way of looking at the world. When confronted with critical decisions about dating, sex, work, even getting dressed in the morning, Iliza argues that women will by nature consider every repercussion of every option before making a move toward what they really want. And that kind of holistic thinking can actually give women an advantage in what is still a male world.\r\n\r\nIn Iliza&apos;s own words: &quot;Understanding Girl Logic is a way of embracing both our aspirations and our contradictions. GL is the desire to be strong and vulnerable. It&apos;s wanting to be curvy, but rail thin at the same time. It&apos;s striving to kick ass in a man&apos;s world while still being loved by the women around you.\r\n\r\n&quot;This book is also for me, because apparently expounding on a stage for two hours a night wasn&apos;t enough. (Trust me, if I could start a cult I would, but I hate the idea of deliberately dying in a group.)&quot;\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-01-31T12:08:31.029Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0930ba29791e991a02e68a314d77af458325603","dn":"Girl Logic by Iliza Shlesinger MOBI","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"c0930ba29791e991a02e68a314d77af458325603","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,147,11,162,151,145,233,145,160,46,104,163,20,215,122,244,88,50,86,3]},"name":"Girl Logic by Iliza Shlesinger MOBI","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
