Partnering with financial comedian and writer Jeff Kreisler, Ariely takes us deep inside our minds to expose the hidden motivations that are secretly driving our choices about money.\r\n\r\nExploring a wide range of everyday topics - from credit card debt and household budgeting to holiday sales - Ariely and Kreisler demonstrate how our ideas about dollars and cents are often wrong and cost us more than we know. Mixing case studies and anecdotes with tangible advice and lessons, they cut through the unconscious fears and desires driving our worst financial instincts and teach us how to improve our money habits.\r\n\r\nFascinating, engaging, funny, and essential, Dollars and Sense is a sound investment, providing us with the practical tools we need to understand and improve our financial choices, save and spend smarter, and ultimately live better.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-11-07T12:01:16.408Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:1181a7b1ba471bc4812623837d7a6f2d0effac61","dn":"Dollars and Sense_ How We Misthink Money .. by Dan Ariely EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"1181a7b1ba471bc4812623837d7a6f2d0effac61","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,129,167,177,186,71,27,196,129,38,35,131,125,122,111,45,14,255,172,97]},"name":"Dollars and Sense_ How We Misthink Money .. by Dan Ariely EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
