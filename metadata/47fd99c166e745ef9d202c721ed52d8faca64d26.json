Whether engaging American and Anglo-Saxon roots styles, psychedelia, or kosmiche projection, his sense of space and attention to melody are enviable. Since forming the Solar Motel Band, his explorations have revolved around everything from muscular jams strong on six-string pyrotechnics, to intensely minimal lyric songs. \r\nDreaming in the Non-Dream contains four songs spread over 35 minutes &#x2014; two are over 11. The set was cut live in the studio with precious few overdubs added later. The Solar Motel Band includes veterans Peter Kerlin on low strings and Shawn Edward Hansen on synth, Wurlitzer, and alto saxophone, along with new drummer Ray Kubian and Jeff Zeigler on electronics. This is a continuation of Forsyth&#x2019;s guitar-based methodology, though the particular nuances differ from what we&#x2019;ve heard before. \r\n\r\nTracklist: \r\n01 - History &amp; Science Fiction.flac \r\n02 - Have We Mistaken the Bottle for the Whiskey Inside.flac \r\n03 - Dreaming in the Non-Dream.flac \r\n04 - Two Minutes Love.flac \r\n\r\nSummary: \r\nCountry: UK \r\nGenre: post-rock, psychedelic rock","last_updated":"2018-06-04T12:14:38.848Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:47fd99c166e745ef9d202c721ed52d8faca64d26","dn":"[post-rock, psychedelic rock] (2017) Chris Forsyth &amp; The S ","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"47fd99c166e745ef9d202c721ed52d8faca64d26","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,253,153,193,102,231,69,239,157,32,44,114,30,213,45,143,172,166,77,38]},"name":"[post-rock, psychedelic rock] (2017) Chris Forsyth &amp; The S ","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
