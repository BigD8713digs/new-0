When struck by severe rheumatoid arthritis in September 1914, the twenty-one-year-old officer&#x2019;s burning ambition and ego could not tolerate being sidelined and the following month he forced himself out of a sick bed to begin a new career as an aviation observer. G&#xF6;ring went on to become a fighter pilot with twenty-two downed enemy aircraft to his credit, the last wartime commander of the Red Baron&#x2019;s own fighter wing, Jagdgeschwader Richthofen, and recipient of a row of prestigious medals including Prussia&#x2019;s highest bravery award, the Pour le M&#xE9;rite.\r\n\r\nPeter Kilduff has produced a landmark volume based on extensive research into G&#xF6;ring&#x2019;s early military records and thousands of German and Allied documents to put the neophyte airman&#x2019;s life and events into perspective. Among other resources, Kilduff drew on G&#xF6;ring&#x2019;s own combat reports and related writings.\r\n\r\nIllustrated with over eighty drawings and photographs, including many from Goring&#x2019;s private collection and never before published, Herman G&#xF6;ring &#x2013; Fighter Ace is a tour de force of historical material covering the early combat career of one of the Twentieth Century&#x2019;s most infamous military figures.\r\n\r\nPrint Length: 224 pages\r\nPublisher: Grub Street (July 13, 2010)","last_updated":"2018-09-24T12:28:33.617Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c17f5058205b98fb575cf8d58b7104f58d3681f","dn":"Herman G&ouml;ring: Fighter Ace","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"5c17f5058205b98fb575cf8d58b7104f58d3681f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,23,245,5,130,5,185,143,181,117,207,141,88,183,16,79,88,211,104,31]},"name":"Herman G&ouml;ring: Fighter Ace","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
