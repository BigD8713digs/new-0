From evolution to the epidural and beyond, Tina Cassidy presents an intelligent, enlightening, and impeccably researched cultural history of how and why we&apos;re born the way we are. Women have been giving birth for millennia, but that&apos;s about the only constant in the final stage of the great process that is human reproduction. Why is it that every culture and generation seems to have its own ideas about the best way to give birth? Cassidy explores the physical, anthropological, political, and religious factors that have and will continue to influence how women bring new life into the world.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-12-10T12:05:19.819Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:0eb580a8cba91ca65167e89973fc66bb984e5f2b","dn":"Birth by Tina Cassidy EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"0eb580a8cba91ca65167e89973fc66bb984e5f2b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,181,128,168,203,169,28,166,81,103,232,153,115,252,102,187,152,78,95,43]},"name":"Birth by Tina Cassidy EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
