His compositions -- particularly for New and Used and Orange Then Blue -- can have a complexity akin to classical music, and Laster has been known to head in chamberesque directions with cellist Erik Friedlander both in his own Interpretations of Lessness and Friedlander&apos;s Topaz. Laster also sees value in understatement; possessing a warm and attractive tone on the alto, he generally steers clear of overblown multiphonics and other extended avant jazz techniques. But calling Laster a chamber jazz musician is too simplistic -- he avoids the austere ECM Eurojazz model and can play with swing, soul, groove, and grit. Soft Shell by Laster&apos;s Hydra quartet has all those qualities, and the CD&apos;s name relates not only to an overall aquatic theme, but also aptly summarizes Laster&apos;s musical balancing act. Ornette Coleman&apos;s classic quartet is an obvious touchstone, with some of the same emphasis on melody and a sonic architecture inviting comparison to Ornette&apos;s pianoless circa-1960 band... - Dave Lynch, AMG","last_updated":"2017-06-03T12:01:12.699Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:21cc7a93d1fa82a028143ef5bf435922701dd075","dn":"Andy Laster's Hydra 2000 Soft Shell","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"21cc7a93d1fa82a028143ef5bf435922701dd075","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,204,122,147,209,250,130,160,40,20,62,245,191,67,89,34,112,29,208,117]},"name":"Andy Laster's Hydra 2000 Soft Shell","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
