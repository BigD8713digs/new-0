This superbly crafted biography draws on recently uncovered documents and archives of personal correspondence, painting an exceptionally human and charming portrait of a man who was well known but little understood. With a sharp attention to detail and an effortless style, Chaim Miller takes us on a soaring journey through the life, mind and struggles of one of the most interesting religious personalities of the Twentieth Century.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-06-16T12:12:30.893Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:86e5e6c0becf321d4b965f00486fc49b6cf9c8c5","dn":"Turning Judaism Outwards by Chaim Miller EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"86e5e6c0becf321d4b965f00486fc49b6cf9c8c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,229,230,192,190,207,50,29,75,150,95,0,72,111,196,155,108,249,200,197]},"name":"Turning Judaism Outwards by Chaim Miller EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
