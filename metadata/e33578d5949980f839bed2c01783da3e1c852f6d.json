Hopper stars as the eponymous American, currently a middleman selling the work of American painter Derwatt (Nicholas Ray), who has feigned his own death to increase the value of his paintings. While auctioning this work in Berlin, he meets art restorer Jonathan Zimmerman (Bruno Ganz), who he learns is suffering from an incurable blood disease. When a shady friend (Gerard Blain) requires Ripley to find a &quot;clean&quot; non-professional to do a contract hit in order to pay off a debt, even he is reluctant. But he quickly realizes that the physically vulnerable Jonathan would be perfect for the job, and tries to get him to accept by employing various subterfuges to persuade him that his condition is even worse than it is. For his part, Blain guarantees the restorer that his family will be financially secure for life, and a deal is struck. As usual, nothing works out quite as expected.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTARS.........: Dennis Hopper, Bruno Ganz, Lisa Kreuzer\r\nDIRECTOR......: Wim Wenders\r\nWRITERS.......: Wim Wenders\r\nGENRE.........: Crime, Drama, Mystery\r\nTOMATOMETER...: 91\r\nIMDB RATING...: 7.4/10  11,050 votes\r\nIMDB LINK.....: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075675\r\nRUNTIME.......: 2h 07mn\r\nSIZE..........: 5.00 GB\r\nVIDEO CODEC...: HEVC (Main@L4)\r\nBITRATE.......: 5000 Kbps (2-pass)\r\nRESOLUTION....: 1920x1080\r\nASPECT RATIO..: 1.66:1\r\nFRAMERATE.....: 23.976 fps\r\nAUDIO.........: German E-AC3 5.1 512kbps\r\nAUDIO.........: Commentary with Wim Wenders and Dennis Hopper\r\nSUBTITLES.....: ENG (Forced/Full)\r\nCHAPTERS......: Yes\r\nSOURCE........: Criterion Collection Blu-ray\r\nENCODED BY....: Sartre\r\nENCODE DATE...: 2018-11-03\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExtras\r\n\r\n&#x2022; Wim Wenders\r\n&#x2022; Bruno Ganz\r\n&#x2022; Deleted Scenes\r\n&#x2022; Trailer","last_updated":"2018-11-13T12:47:47.289Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:e33578d5949980f839bed2c01783da3e1c852f6d","dn":"The.American.Friend.1977.Criterion.1080p.BluRay.x265.HEVC-SARTRE","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"e33578d5949980f839bed2c01783da3e1c852f6d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,53,120,213,148,153,128,248,57,190,210,192,23,131,218,62,28,133,47,109]},"name":"The.American.Friend.1977.Criterion.1080p.BluRay.x265.HEVC-SARTRE","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
