It stands as perhaps the greatest existentialist tale ever conceived, and is certainly one of the most important and influential books ever produced. \r\n\r\nWhen a young Algerian named Meursault kills a man, his subsequent imprisonment and trial are puzzling and absurd. The apparently amoral Meursault, who puts little stock in ideas like love and God, seems to be on trial less for his murderous actions, and more for what the authorities believe is his deficient character.\r\n\r\nThis remarkable translation by Matthew Ward has been considered the definitive English version since its original publication. It unlocks the prose as no other English version has, allowing the reader to soak up the richness of Camus&apos; ideas.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-08-22T12:00:30.856Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:085393164b3c417f96ca1616e45d83acc3443993","dn":"The Stranger by Albert Camus ePUB MOBI eBOOK-ZAK","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"085393164b3c417f96ca1616e45d83acc3443993","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,83,147,22,75,60,65,127,150,202,22,22,228,93,131,172,195,68,57,147]},"name":"The Stranger by Albert Camus ePUB MOBI eBOOK-ZAK","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
