Brand speaks to those suffering along the full spectrum of addiction&#x2015;from drugs, alcohol, caffeine, and sugar addictions to addictions to work, stress, bad relationships, digital media, and fame. Brand understands that addiction can take many shapes and sizes and how the process of staying clean, sane, and unhooked is a daily activity. He believes that the question is not &#x201C;Why are you addicted?&#x201D; but &#x201C;What pain is your addiction masking? Why are you running&#x2015;into the wrong job, the wrong life, the wrong person&#x2019;s arms?&#x201D;\r\nRussell has been in all the twelve-step fellowships going, he&#x2019;s started his own men&#x2019;s group, he&#x2019;s a therapy regular and a practiced yogi&#x2015;and while he&#x2019;s worked on this material as part of his comedy and previous bestsellers, he&#x2019;s never before shared the tools that really took him out of it, that keep him clean and clear. Here he provides not only a recovery plan, but an attempt to make sense of the ailing world","last_updated":"2017-09-28T12:05:39.760Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:140a68cd382b5a0b8e499e72620a100468b21637","dn":"Recovery: Freedom from Our Addictions by Russell Brand [ePub]","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"140a68cd382b5a0b8e499e72620a100468b21637","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,10,104,205,56,43,90,11,142,73,158,114,98,10,16,4,104,178,22,55]},"name":"Recovery: Freedom from Our Addictions by Russell Brand [ePub]","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
