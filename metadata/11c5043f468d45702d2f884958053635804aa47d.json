Wellness guru Cedella Marley, the daughter of famed reggae legend Bob Marley and the face of the premium cannabis brand, grew up in Jamaica with the familiar scent of The Herb and experienced its restorative and spiritual properties firsthand. Today cannabis still plays a role in her wellness regimen, whether it&#x2019;s in her hemp-based moisturizer or in a soothing morning tea, and in Cooking with Herb, Cedella shows readers how they too can experience the healing benefits of cannabis safely and pleasurably. She guides readers on the questions they should ask at dispensaries, offers insights on today&#x2019;s more potent weed, demystifies the process behind controlling the dosage of cannabis in edibles, and shares a collection of more than 75 Caribbean-inflected, canna-boosted recipes (along with strategies readers can use to integrate these dishes into their entertaining practices). And because food is only one aspect of Cedella&apos;s wellness routine, she also highlights the other ways she uses cannabis, sharing recipes for homemade beauty scrubs and hair treatments&#x2014;even tips readers can use to elevate their yoga and meditation practices. Filled with practical information, beautiful photography, and Cedella&apos;s personal stories about growing up with her famous father, Cooking with Herb will teach readers to use and enjoy cannabis in a manner that&#x2019;s enlightened, respectful, and responsible","last_updated":"2017-07-27T12:01:02.886Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:11c5043f468d45702d2f884958053635804aa47d","dn":"Cooking with Herb 75 Recipes (2017) [WWRG]","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"11c5043f468d45702d2f884958053635804aa47d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,197,4,63,70,141,69,112,45,47,136,73,88,5,54,53,128,74,164,125]},"name":"Cooking with Herb 75 Recipes (2017) [WWRG]","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
