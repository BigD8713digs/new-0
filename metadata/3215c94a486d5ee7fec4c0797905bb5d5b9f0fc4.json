Das, S.M. Hassanizadeh (Springer, 2005).pdf\r\n\r\nThis book provides concise, up-to-date and easy-to-follow information on certain aspects of an ever important research area: multiphase flow in porous media. This flow type is of great significance in many petroleum and environmental engineering problems, such as in secondary and tertiary oil recovery, subsurface remediation and CO2 sequestration. This book contains a collection of selected papers (all refereed) from a number of well-known experts on multiphase flow. The papers describe both recent and state-of-the-art modeling and experimental techniques for study of multiphase flow phenomena in porous media. Specifically, the book analyses three advanced topics: upscaling, pore-scale modeling, and dynamic effects in multiphase flow in porous media.\r\n\r\nThis will be an invaluable reference for the development of new theories and computer-based modeling techniques for solving realistic multiphase flow problems. Part of this book has already been published in a journal.\r\n\r\nAudience\r\n\r\nThis book will be of interest to academics, researchers and consultants working in the area of flow in porous media","last_updated":"2017-06-07T12:04:52.937Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:3215c94a486d5ee7fec4c0797905bb5d5b9f0fc4","dn":"Upscaling Multiphase Flow in Porous Media","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"3215c94a486d5ee7fec4c0797905bb5d5b9f0fc4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,21,201,74,72,109,94,231,254,196,192,121,121,5,187,93,91,159,15,196]},"name":"Upscaling Multiphase Flow in Porous Media","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
