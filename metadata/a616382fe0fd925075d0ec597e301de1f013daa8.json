Raised in an immigrant Indian family in the start-up hub of Silicon Valley, she believed that every entrepreneur could be successful. So she left her cushy job at Merrill Lynch to take a risk, find her passion, and make a change in the world. She moved to India to start a company.\r\n\r\nIn Freedom to Fail, Shabnam tells the story of her brush with success : raising her first round of venture capital; hiring a hardworking team of millennials; growing her start-up to multiple cities&#x2026;and then finding it all come to a bitter end.\r\n\r\nShabnam gives us a peek into the world of start-ups in India. Her personal journey gives us an insight into dealing with failure, warning us of the challenges of starting a business, and helping us learn from her experience. Weaving each chapter into a powerful lesson in overcoming expectations, fear and self-doubt, she shows us why failure is important, even imperative, in order to ultimately succeed. And the best lesson she learnt: You haven&apos;t failed until you stop trying.\r\n\r\nGenre: Non-Fiction &gt; General","last_updated":"2018-11-26T12:16:31.374Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:a616382fe0fd925075d0ec597e301de1f013daa8","dn":"Freedom to Fail by Shabnam Aggarwal (.epub)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"a616382fe0fd925075d0ec597e301de1f013daa8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,22,56,47,224,253,146,80,117,208,236,89,126,48,29,225,240,19,218,168]},"name":"Freedom to Fail by Shabnam Aggarwal (.epub)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
