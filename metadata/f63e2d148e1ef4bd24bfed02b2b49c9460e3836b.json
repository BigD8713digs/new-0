Dick was a genius, a brilliant science fiction author who spent most of his life broke, whose work, since his death, has become the basis for some of the classic films of the genre. First, there was &quot;Blade Runner,&quot; which he was able to see some clips of before he passed. This is the story of a man, (Harrison Ford), tasked with terminating some replicants who&apos;d illegally returned to Earth. Secondly, &quot;Total Recall,&quot; in which Arnold Schwarzenegger discovers he has actual memories of being a spy on Mars buried in his subconscious. Third, in &quot;Minority Report,&quot; murder has been eliminated, as Tom Cruise&apos;s &apos;Pre-crime&apos; department arrests people before the crime has been committed. Finally, &quot;A Scanner Darkly,&quot; where a DEA agent, (Keanu Reeves), is forced to spy on himself, and he slowly goes mad. Brilliant premises, top stars and some of the best directors in Hollywood make the stories unforgettable.\r\n\r\nAs always, support the artists by buying their work.
