What career advice should we give today&apos;s kids?\r\n\r\n How can we make future AI systems more robust, so that they do what we want without crashing, malfunctioning or getting hacked? Should we fear an arms race in lethal autonomous weapons?\r\n\r\n Will machines eventually outsmart us at all tasks, replacing humans on the job market and perhaps altogether?\r\n\r\n Will AI help life flourish like never before or give us more power than we can handle?\r\n\r\nWhat sort of future do you want? This book empowers you to join what may be the most important conversation of our time.\r\n\r\n It doesn&apos;t shy away from the full range of viewpoints or from the most controversial issues-from superintelligence to meaning, consciousness and the ultimate physical limits on life in the cosmos.\r\n\r\nMAX TEGMARK is a professor of physics at MIT and the co-founder of the Future of Life Institute. Tegmark has been featured in dozens of science documentaries. His passion for ideas, adventure, and entrepreneurship is infectious","last_updated":"2017-09-03T12:02:08.043Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:426669ff0bff487488568f44e51a977b705be69d","dn":"Life 3.0: Being Human in the Age of Artificial Intelligence/Max ","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"426669ff0bff487488568f44e51a977b705be69d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,102,105,255,11,255,72,116,136,86,143,68,229,26,151,123,112,91,230,157]},"name":"Life 3.0: Being Human in the Age of Artificial Intelligence/Max ","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
