Anything can happen in a sizzling Fool&#x2019;s Gold story from New York Times best-selling author Susan Mallery.\r\nIsabel Beebe thinks she&#x2019;s cursed in the romance department. Her teenage crush, Ford Hendrix, ignored all her letters. Her husband left her for another...man. So Isabel has come home to dust off her passion for fashion and run the family bridal shop until her parents are ready to sell it. Then she&#x2019;ll pursue her real dreams. At least, that&#x2019;s the plan, until sexy, charming Ford returns and leaves her feeling 14 all over again&#x2026;.\r\nSeeing Isabel all grown-up hits bodyguard trainer Ford like a sucker punch. Back when heartbreak made him join the military, her sweet letters kept him sane. Now he can&#x2019;t take his eyes - or his lips - off her. The man who gave up on love has a reason to stay in Fool&#x2019;s Gold forever - if three little words can convince Isabel to do the same.\r\n&#xA9;2013 Susan Macias Redmond (P)2013 Brilliance Audio, Inc","last_updated":"2017-09-20T12:07:18.405Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:12b72cf115c4838439b959856e135a2e4847e7e8","dn":"Three Little Words audiobook by Susan Mallery [EarReaders]","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"12b72cf115c4838439b959856e135a2e4847e7e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,183,44,241,21,196,131,132,57,185,89,133,110,19,90,46,72,71,231,232]},"name":"Three Little Words audiobook by Susan Mallery [EarReaders]","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
