At least that&apos;s how it appears from the outside. But within the walls of the family&apos;s opulent mansion, dysfunction and double lives threaten to destroy the Cryers&apos; world of privilege. The family&apos;s patriarch, Jim, is a powerful judge with political ambitions that are put at risk by his double life that includes affairs with high-priced escorts. Jim&apos;s wife, Katheryn, is willing to do whatever it takes to protect her family&apos;s status while playing the role of a loving and dutiful wife. Son Wyatt is a troubled jock who continuously goes in and out of rehab, and daughter Amanda is a struggling law student who has unknowingly befriended a woman, Candace Young, who has the power to ruin the entire family and also happens to be the estranged daughter of the Cryers&apos; maid, Hanna. When manipulative Candace realizes that she is Jim&apos;s escort, she sees that as an opportunity of a lifetime","last_updated":"2018-06-06T12:06:09.024Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:be3b10a3f2e23c72d7ddafe409858196beaf936c","dn":"The.Haves.and.the.Have.Not Season4 Complete","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"be3b10a3f2e23c72d7ddafe409858196beaf936c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,59,16,163,242,226,60,114,215,221,175,228,9,133,129,150,190,175,147,108]},"name":"The.Haves.and.the.Have.Not Season4 Complete","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
