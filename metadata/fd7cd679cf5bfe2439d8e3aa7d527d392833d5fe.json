Unfortunately I was not willing to go through a 3 hour broadcast to try and remove them all so you&apos;re getting it the same way I got it. I do believe that most of the problems occurred later in the show and many of \r\nthe issues were removed with the commercials so maybe it won&apos;t be too bad.
