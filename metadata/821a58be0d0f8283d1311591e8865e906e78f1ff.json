Askeland, Wendelin J. Wright\r\nISBN-13: 9781305076761\r\nBOOK SPECS: https://www.cengage.com/c/the-science-and-engineering-of-materials-7e-askeland\r\nFILE SPECS: true PDF, logical page numbers as in the print version, bookmarks, 28 MB\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: Askeland&apos;s THE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING OF MATERIALS helps engineering students develop an understanding of the relationship between structure, processing, and properties of materials. The author emphasizes a science-based approach to materials engineering that highlights how the structure of materials at various length scales gives rise to materials properties. This connection between structure and properties is key to innovating with materials, both in the synthesis of new materials and in enabling new applications with existing materials. Selecting from the seventh edition&apos;s comprehensive topic coverage, instructors can emphasize materials, provide a general overview, concentrate on mechanical behavior, or focus on physical properties.\r\n\r\nBRIEF CONTENTS:\r\n---------------\r\n1- Introduction to Materials Science and Engineering\r\n2- Atomic Structure\r\n3- Atomic and Ionic Arrangements\r\n4- Imperfections in the Atomic and Ionic Arrangements\r\n5- Atom and Ion Movements in Materials\r\n6- Mechanical Properties: Part One\r\n7- Mechanical Properties: Part Two\r\n8- Strain Hardening and Annealing\r\n9- Principles of Solidification\r\n10- Solid Solutions and Phase Equilibrium\r\n11- Dispersion Strengthening and Eutectic Phase Diagrams\r\n12- Dispersion Strengthening by Phase Transformations and Heat Treatment\r\n13- Heat Treatment of Steels and Cast Irons\r\n14- Nonferrous Alloys\r\n15- Ceramics\r\n16- Polymers\r\n17- Composites: Teamwork and Synergy in Materials\r\n18- Construction Materials\r\n19- Electronic Materials\r\n20- Magnetic Materials\r\n21- Photonic Materials\r\n22- Thermal Properties of Materials\r\n23- Corrosion and Wear\r\nappendixes\r\nanswers\r\nindex\r\n\r\n\r\n**********************  6th ed 2011  ************************ <a href=\"\nhttps://btdb.to/torrent/D03y4xM9DXhJ1K5ydYN3uyljNO0K8QHmW93.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://btdb.to/torrent/D03y4xM9DXhJ1K5ydYN3uyljNO0K8QHmW93.html</a>","last_updated":"2018-10-11T12:30:28.984Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:821a58be0d0f8283d1311591e8865e906e78f1ff","dn":"The Science and Engineering of Materials 7th ed 2016 Askeland","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"821a58be0d0f8283d1311591e8865e906e78f1ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,26,88,190,13,15,130,131,209,49,21,145,232,134,94,144,110,120,241,255]},"name":"The Science and Engineering of Materials 7th ed 2016 Askeland","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
