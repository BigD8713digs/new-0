Then again, maybe he simply would have taken a slightly longer nap before setting off on his wild adventure. And it isn&apos;t just Tully, whom Buffett fans will remember well from Jimmy&apos;s best-selling Tales from Margaritaville, on the madcap quest.\r\n\r\nThere&apos;s Ix-Nay, an Indian shaman with a dislike of the media; Mr. Twain, Tully&apos;s loyal steed; Cleopatra Highbourne, the 102-year-old owner of Cayo Loco and Cuban baseball addict; Captain Kirk, fishing trip leader and boatman extraordinaire; former country music star Sean Spurl, aka Tex Sex; Bucky Norman, a Wyoming cowboy who has found his way to the ocean; and even a fellow named Jimmy Buffett, who decides he might as well join in on the party.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-12-09T12:07:08.141Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3e2bed8b50029457ac1fa4877e2d7613e3296d8","dn":"A Salty Piece of Land by Jimmy Buffett EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"e3e2bed8b50029457ac1fa4877e2d7613e3296d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,226,190,216,181,0,41,69,122,193,250,72,119,226,215,97,62,50,150,216]},"name":"A Salty Piece of Land by Jimmy Buffett EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
