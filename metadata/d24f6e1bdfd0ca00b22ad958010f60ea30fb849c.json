When humanity is transformed into mindless drones by a terrifying supernatural event only Minji appears to be immune. Thousands die instantly, but the other affected people are drawn to the Nevada desert.\r\n\r\nNothing stands in the way of the mesmerized. Not fire, not heights, not rubble. As the bodies pile in the streets and the relentless wave of the mesmerized plods into the deadly desert, Minji is trapped in a burning city attempting to rescue her family. When Minji encounters other unaffected survivors, they band together to survive in a city that is crumbling all around them. With no hope of rescue and the event slowly spreading across the world, Minji and the others must decide who to save among the mesmerized and where to go before the city is in ashes. Even more unsettling is that Minji senses that the force behind the event is observing them...Can one woman save her family and the world?\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-01-23T12:00:28.050Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:d24f6e1bdfd0ca00b22ad958010f60ea30fb849c","dn":"The Mesmerized by Rhiannon Frater EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"d24f6e1bdfd0ca00b22ad958010f60ea30fb849c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,79,110,27,223,208,202,0,178,42,217,88,1,15,96,234,48,251,132,156]},"name":"The Mesmerized by Rhiannon Frater EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
