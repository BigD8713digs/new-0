He travels across Iran, Syria and Egypt to discover the huge astronomical advances made by Islamic scholars through their obsession with accurate measurement and coherent and rigorous mathematics.\r\nHe then visits Italy to see how those Islamic ideas permeated into the west and ultimately helped shape the works of the great European astronomer Copernicus, and investigates why science in the Islamic world appeared to go into decline after the 16th and 17th centuries, only for it to re-emerge in the present day.\r\nAl-Khalili ends his journey in the Royan Institute in the Iranian capital Tehran, looking at how science is now regarded in the Islamic world.\r\n\r\nVideo: MP4 H264 @2.8Mbps\r\nAudio: AAC 2ch @100Kbps\r\nSubtitles: English .SRT","last_updated":"2018-05-24T12:08:42.000Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8f40bdbb1f3a66cae4635c8058a1d5527507e9a","dn":"Science and Islam 3 The Power of Doubt 720p MP4   subs BigJ0554","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"b8f40bdbb1f3a66cae4635c8058a1d5527507e9a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,244,11,219,177,243,166,108,174,70,53,200,5,138,29,85,39,80,126,154]},"name":"Science and Islam 3 The Power of Doubt 720p MP4   subs BigJ0554","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
