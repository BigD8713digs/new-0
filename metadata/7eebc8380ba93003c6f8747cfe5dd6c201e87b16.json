Her husband, Massud - a fellow architect - is caught in the cross fire and dies before she can confess her greatest secret to him. Now under threat from a powerful military intelligence officer, who demands that she pardon her husband&apos;s American killer, Nargis fears that the truth about her past will soon be exposed.\r\n\r\nFor weeks someone has been broadcasting people&apos;s secrets from the minaret of the local mosque, and, in a country where even the accusation of blasphemy is a currency to be bartered, the mysterious broadcasts have struck fear in Christians and Muslims alike. When the loudspeakers reveal a forbidden romance between a Muslim cleric&apos;s daughter and Nargis&apos;s Christian neighbor, Nargis finds herself trapped in the center of the chaos tearing their community apart. In his characteristically luminous prose, Nadeem Aslam has given us a lionhearted novel that reflects Pakistan&apos;s past and present in a single mirror, a story of corruption, resilience, and the disguises that are sometimes necessary for survival - a revelatory portrait of the human spirit.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-12-10T12:01:08.224Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:7eebc8380ba93003c6f8747cfe5dd6c201e87b16","dn":"The Golden Legend by Nadeem Aslam EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"7eebc8380ba93003c6f8747cfe5dd6c201e87b16","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,235,200,56,11,169,48,3,198,248,116,124,254,93,214,194,1,232,123,22]},"name":"The Golden Legend by Nadeem Aslam EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
