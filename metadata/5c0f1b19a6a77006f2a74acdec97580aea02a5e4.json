A growing body of research has revealed our capacity for resilient grieving, our innate ability to respond to traumatic loss by finding ways to grow - by becoming more engaged with our lives, and discovering new, profound meaning. \r\n\r\nAuthor and resilience/well-being expert Lucy Hone, a pioneer in fusing positive psychology and bereavement research, was faced with her own inescapable sorrow when, in 2014, her 12-year-old daughter was killed in a car accident. By following the strategies of resilient grieving, she found a proactive way to move through her grief, and, over time, embrace life again. \r\n\r\nResilient Grieving offers an empowering alternative to the five-stage K&#xFC;bler-Ross model of grief - and makes clear our inherent capacity for growth following the trauma of a loss that changes everything. \r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-11-30T12:00:41.524Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c0f1b19a6a77006f2a74acdec97580aea02a5e4","dn":"Resilient Grieving by Lucy Hone EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"5c0f1b19a6a77006f2a74acdec97580aea02a5e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,15,27,25,166,167,112,6,242,167,74,205,236,151,88,10,234,2,165,228]},"name":"Resilient Grieving by Lucy Hone EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
