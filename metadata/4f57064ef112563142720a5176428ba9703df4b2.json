You start the game with hundreds of loose parts and assemble \r\nboth car and engine. Not only you need to maintain your car, but \r\nyourself as well. Sausages, beer and sleeping will do just fine. If\r\n everything goes well, you have a working car which you can use for \r\nvarious 1990&apos;s Finnish countryside summer activities. Basically doing \r\nstupid things under influence of alcohol. After you have gathered extra \r\nmoney from various random jobs, you can start to tune and upgrade the \r\ncar with parts ordered via snail mail. You can turn the car into a \r\nobnoxious bass-boom disco machine.... or into a rally car to participate\r\n rally competitions... or just fix it into perfect factory condition. Of\r\n course car also needs to pass the inspection or you might get into \r\ntrouble with police. Not only you have access to one car, but \r\nalso several other cars and vehicles which you can use. (Mostly useful \r\nto get groceries and for towing the project car from some ditch, again)","last_updated":"2017-07-22T12:00:29.348Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f57064ef112563142720a5176428ba9703df4b2","dn":"My Summer Car v20.07.2017","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"4f57064ef112563142720a5176428ba9703df4b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,87,6,78,241,18,86,49,66,114,10,81,118,66,139,169,112,61,244,178]},"name":"My Summer Car v20.07.2017","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
