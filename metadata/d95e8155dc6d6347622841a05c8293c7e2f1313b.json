Consider the onion in these three marvelous incarnations: Lebanese Caramelized Onions, American Buttermilk Fried Onion Rings, and French Onion and Bacon Tart. And the chile section encourages readers to use real chiles (rather than reach for bottled hot sauce) on an everyday basis in recipes from Morocco to India, from Mexico to China, with wonderful results.\r\n\r\nA masterwork of recipes, approach, technique, and philosophy, David Tanis Market Cooking is as inspiring as it is essential. This is how to become a more intuitive and spontaneous cook. This is how to be more discerning in the market and freer in the kitchen. This is how to transform the freshest ingredients into one perfectly delicious dish after another, guided by the core beliefs that have shaped David Tanis&apos;s incomparable career: Food doesn&apos;t have to be fussy to be satisfying. Seasonal vegetables should be central to a meal. Working with food is a joy, not a chore","last_updated":"2017-10-14T12:01:49.907Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:d95e8155dc6d6347622841a05c8293c7e2f1313b","dn":"David Tanis Market Cooking Recipes and Revelations, Ingredient b","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"d95e8155dc6d6347622841a05c8293c7e2f1313b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,94,129,85,220,109,99,71,98,40,65,160,92,130,147,199,226,241,49,59]},"name":"David Tanis Market Cooking Recipes and Revelations, Ingredient b","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
