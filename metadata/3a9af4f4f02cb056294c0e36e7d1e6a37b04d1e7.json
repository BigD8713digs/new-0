During the election, the boys are paid by the Small Party to cause trouble. When their attempt to burn down the opposition&#x2019;s local headquarters ends in disaster, Dantala must run for his life, leaving his best friend behind. He makes his way to a mosque that provides him with food, shelter, and guidance. With his quick aptitude and modest nature, Dantala becomes a favored apprentice to the mosque&#x2019;s sheikh. Before long, he is faced with a terrible conflict of loyalties, as one of the sheikh&#x2019;s closest advisors begins to raise his own radical movement. When bloodshed erupts in the city around him, Dantala must decide what kind of Muslim&#x2014;and what kind of man&#x2014;he wants to be. Told in Dantala&#x2019;s na&#xEF;ve, searching voice, this astonishing debut explores the ways in which young men are seduced by religious fundamentalism and violence.\r\n\r\nAvailable in PDF, MOBI and EPUB.\r\n\r\nI have also added a sweet note in the folder.
