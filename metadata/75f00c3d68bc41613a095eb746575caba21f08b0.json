Across many countries, activist investors have pursued engagements with management of target companies. \r\n\r\nMore recently, the role of the hostile activist shareholder has been taken up by a set of hedge funds. Hedge fund activism is characterized by mergers and corporate restructuring, replacement of management and board members, proxy voting, and lobbying of management.
