Giancoli\r\nISBN-13: 9781292020761\r\nBOOK SPECS: http://catalogue.pearsoned.co.uk/educator/product/9781292020761.page\r\nFILE SPECS:\r\n  text: &quot;true&quot; PDF, logical page numbers as in the print version, bookmarks, 72 MB\r\n  solutions: true PDF, bookmarks, 12 MB\r\n\r\nCOURSE: calculus-based General Physics course primarily taken by engineers and science majors (including physics majors)\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: This long-awaited and extensive revision maintains Giancoli&apos;s reputation for creating carefully crafted, highly accurate and precise physics texts. &quot;Physics for Scientists and Engineers&quot; combines outstanding pedagogy with a clear and direct narrative and applications that draw the student into the physics. The new edition also features an unrivaled suite of media and on-line resources that enhance the understanding of physics.\r\n\r\nThis book is written for students. It aims to explain physics in a readable and interesting manner that is accessible and clear, and to teach students by anticipating their needs and difficulties without oversimplifying.\r\n\r\nPhysics is a description of reality, and thus each topic begins with concrete observations and experiences that students can directly relate to. We then move on to the generalizations and more formal treatment of the topic. Not only does this make the material more interesting and easier to understand, but it is closer to the way physics is actually practiced.\r\n\r\nBRIEF CONTENTS: extensive (3 volumes, 43 + 1 chapters); see BOOK SPECS above for details\r\n\r\n\r\n*****  file in DJVU format (.djvu) of 4th national edition 2008  *****\r\nsources:\nDJVU format reader: http://windjview.sourceforge.net/","last_updated":"2018-10-27T12:50:45.758Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:94b8f6909e1a10af5ae7463a1b12ec125d80f68c","dn":"Physics for Scientists and Engineers 4th ed Global 2014 Giancoli","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"94b8f6909e1a10af5ae7463a1b12ec125d80f68c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,184,246,144,158,26,16,175,90,231,70,58,27,18,236,18,93,128,246,140]},"name":"Physics for Scientists and Engineers 4th ed Global 2014 Giancoli","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
