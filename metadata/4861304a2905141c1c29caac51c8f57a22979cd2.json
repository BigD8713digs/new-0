It protects your private information against known and unknown keylogging malware on millions of websites and in hundreds of essential apps.\r\n\r\nDeep, Real-time Encryption\r\nThe moment you begin typing, KeyScrambler begins encrypting each character instantly at the keyboard driver level, deep in the Windows kernel. The timing and location makes it difficult for keyloggers to bypass KeyScrambler&apos;s protection.\r\n\r\nInnovative Technology for Strong Protection\r\nYour keystrokes remain encrypted as they travel through the perilous path in the operating system, where keyloggers can be physically or remotely installed on your computer to intercept your keystrokes. We&apos;ve implemented both standard symmetric-key encryption (Blowfish 128-bit) and asymmetric-key encryption (RSA 1024-bit) in KeyScrambler. The strong encryption defeats even the most insidious kind of keylogging malware.\r\n\r\nWorks on Malware-Infected Computers\r\nShould a keylogger have wormed into your computer and escaped detection, KeyScrambler will still work, and the keylogger would have only a meaningless jumble of characters to record. When your encrypted keystrokes reach the destination app, the decryption module of KeyScrambler goes to work, and you see exactly the keys you&apos;ve typed. Here the journey ends with your info intact.\r\n\r\nOfficial Website: https://www.qfxsoftware.com/index.html","last_updated":"2018-09-22T12:28:55.844Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:4861304a2905141c1c29caac51c8f57a22979cd2","dn":"QFX KeyScrambler Pro v3.12.0.1","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"4861304a2905141c1c29caac51c8f57a22979cd2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,97,48,74,41,5,20,28,28,41,202,172,81,200,245,122,34,151,156,210]},"name":"QFX KeyScrambler Pro v3.12.0.1","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
