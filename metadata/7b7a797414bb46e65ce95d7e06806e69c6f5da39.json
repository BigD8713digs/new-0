Computer vision is one of today&apos;s most exciting application fields of machine learning, with Deep Learning driving innovative systems such as self-driving cars and Google&apos;s DeepMind.\r\n\r\nOpenCV lies at the intersection of these topics, providing a comprehensive open-source library for classic as well as state-of-the-art computer vision and machine learning algorithms. In combination with Python Anaconda, you will have access to all the open-source computing libraries you could possibly ask for.\r\n\r\nMachine learning for OpenCV begins by introducing you to the essential concepts of statistical learning, such as classification and regression. Once all the basics are covered, you will start exploring various algorithms such as decision trees, support vector machines, and Bayesian networks, and learn how to combine them with other OpenCV functionality. As the book progresses, so will your machine learning skills, until you are ready to take on today&apos;s hottest topic in the field: Deep Learning.\r\n\r\nBy the end of this book, you will be ready to take on your own machine learning problems, either by building on the existing source code or developing your own algorithm from scratch!\r\n\r\nStyle and approach\r\n\r\nOpenCV machine learning connects the fundamental theoretical principles behind machine learning to their practical applications in a way that focuses on asking and answering the right questions. This book walks you through the key elements of OpenCV and its powerful machine learning classes, while demonstrating how to get to grips with a range of models","last_updated":"2018-06-02T12:11:34.481Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b7a797414bb46e65ce95d7e06806e69c6f5da39","dn":"Machine Learning for OpenCV - Michael Beyeler Epub ","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"7b7a797414bb46e65ce95d7e06806e69c6f5da39","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,122,121,116,20,187,70,230,92,233,93,126,6,128,110,105,198,245,218,57]},"name":"Machine Learning for OpenCV - Michael Beyeler Epub ","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
