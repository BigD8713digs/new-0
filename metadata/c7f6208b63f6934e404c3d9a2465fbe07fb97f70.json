Author Nagisa Tatsumi urges us to reflect on our attitudes toward possessing things and to have the courage and conviction to get rid of all the stuff we really don&apos;t need, offering advice on how to tackle the things that pile up at home and take back control. By learning the art of discarding, you will gain space, free yourself from &quot;accumulation syndrome&quot;, and find new joy and purpose in your clutter-free life.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-07-11T12:00:21.190Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:c7f6208b63f6934e404c3d9a2465fbe07fb97f70","dn":"Nagisa Tatsumi - The Art of Discarding 2017 RETAiL ePUB eBOOK-Di","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"c7f6208b63f6934e404c3d9a2465fbe07fb97f70","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,246,32,139,99,246,147,78,64,76,61,154,36,101,251,224,127,185,127,112]},"name":"Nagisa Tatsumi - The Art of Discarding 2017 RETAiL ePUB eBOOK-Di","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
