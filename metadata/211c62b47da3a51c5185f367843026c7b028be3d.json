The rich wear special suits that protect them from the pollution and viruses that plague the city, while those without suffer illness and early deaths. Frustrated by his city&#x2019;s corruption and still grieving the loss of his mother, who died as a result of it, Zhou is determined to change things, no matter the cost.\r\n\r\nWith the help of his friends, Zhou infiltrates the lives of the wealthy in hopes of destroying the international Jin Corporation from within. Jin Corp not only manufactures the special suits the rich rely on, but they may also be manufacturing the pollution that makes them necessary.\r\n\r\nYet the deeper Zhou delves into this new world of excess and wealth, the more muddled his plans become. And against his better judgment, Zhou finds himself falling for Daiyu, the daughter of Jin Corp&#x2019;s CEO. Can Zhou save his city without compromising who he is or destroying his own heart?","last_updated":"2017-08-04T12:00:58.201Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:211c62b47da3a51c5185f367843026c7b028be3d","dn":"Want (Want #1) - Cindy Pon [Shades]epub","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"211c62b47da3a51c5185f367843026c7b028be3d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,28,98,180,125,163,165,28,81,133,243,103,132,48,38,199,176,40,190,61]},"name":"Want (Want #1) - Cindy Pon [Shades]epub","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
