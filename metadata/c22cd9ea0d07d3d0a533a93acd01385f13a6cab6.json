But this time Boch isn&#x2019;t interested in trading them for cash. He needs the unique talents of Dr. Daniel Jackson &#x2013; and he&#x2019;ll do anything to get them. \r\n\r\nColonel Jack O&#x2019;Neill and his team are taken to Boch&#x2019;s ravaged home-world and handed over to the insane Goa&#x2019;uld, Sebek. Obsessed with opening a mysterious subterranean vault, Sebek demands that Jackson translate the arcane writing on the doors.&#x2002;When Jackson refuses, the Goa&#x2019;uld resorts to devastating measures to ensure his cooperation. \r\n\r\nWith the vault exerting an increasingly malign influence, Sebek compels Jackson and O&#x2019;Neill toward a horror that threatens both their sanity and their lives. Meanwhile, Carter and Teal&#x2019;c struggle to persuade the starving people of Aris Boch&#x2019;s world to risk everything they have to save SG-1 &#x2013; and free their desolate world of the Goa&#x2019;uld forever. \r\n\r\nSiren Song \r\nSebek moved toward Daniel with his easy predatory grace and stepped into his space, as if Daniel was a thing he owned. He was too close. If they made their move, and Daniel wasn&#x2019;t quick enough&#x2026;Daniel was standing as straight and stiff as he could, trying to match Sebek&#x2019;s height; for a moment, neither moved. \r\n\r\nTeal&#x2019;c&#x2019;s grip on Jack&#x2019;s arm tightened before his hand dropped away. As soon as the opportunity came, they were going to take it. \r\n\r\n&#x201C;Your threats are meaningless,&#x201D; Sebek said, and waved at the Jaffa, who leveled their weapons at SG-1. &#x201C;If your friends mean anything to you, your choice is simple.&#x201D; \r\n\r\nDaniel didn&#x2019;t look at any of them. His chin came up, and he pointed to the Ancient inscription. &#x201C;Do you see this? Do you have the slightest understanding of what it means? It&#x2019;s a warning. It means whatever&#x2019;s in there is dangerous. A warning from the Ancients is incredibly rare.&#x201D; He leaned forward, nostrils flaring, gaze still locked with Sebek&#x2019;s, and said, &#x201C;Only a very, very foolish person would ignore it. Whatever&#x2019;s in there is causing&#x2026;this.&#x201D; Daniel swept one hand around in a circle, indicating all of them. &#x201C;None of us are immune to its power.&#x201D; \r\n\r\nSebek threw back his head and laughed with typical Goa&#x2019;uld condescension. &#x201C;Why should a warning from a long-dead race mean anything to us?&#x201D; he said. He gripped Daniel by the neck, long fingers sliding around his throat like steel talons. &#x201C;It is that power we must harness. So now you will choose, or we will choose for you.&#x201D;\r\n\r\nOfficial AnonCrypt accounts:  <a href=\"\nhttps://1337x.to/user/AnonCrypt/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://1337x.to/user/AnonCrypt/</a>  <a href=\"\nhttps://katcr.co/user/AnonCrypt/profile/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://katcr.co/user/AnonCrypt/profile/</a>  <a href=\"\nhttps://www.torrentfunk.com/user/anoncrypt.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://www.torrentfunk.com/user/anoncrypt.html</a> \r\n\r\n- Please check the newest torrents as this list will be updated in the future","last_updated":"2018-07-03T12:06:01.735Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:c22cd9ea0d07d3d0a533a93acd01385f13a6cab6","dn":"Stargate SG-1 - Siren Song - SG1-06 - Fandemonium Ltd","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"c22cd9ea0d07d3d0a533a93acd01385f13a6cab6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,44,217,234,13,7,211,208,165,51,169,58,205,1,56,95,19,166,202,182]},"name":"Stargate SG-1 - Siren Song - SG1-06 - Fandemonium Ltd","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
