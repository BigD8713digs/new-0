Now Connors returns with the story of what drove him up to the tower in the first place: the wilderness years he spent reeling in the wake of a family tragedy. This is an unforgettable account of grappling with a shattered sense of purpose, from his family&apos;s failing pig farm in Minnesota to a crack-addled Brooklyn neighborhood to the mountains of New Mexico, where he puts the pieces of his life back together. Like Cheryl Strayed&apos;s Wild, this is a finely wrought look back at wayward youth - and a redemptive story about discovering one&#x2019;s place in the world.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-06-03T12:08:03.882Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1832b12244c8b844b84a743d6c54bc4306e8131","dn":"All the Wrong Places by Phillip Connors EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"a1832b12244c8b844b84a743d6c54bc4306e8131","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,131,43,18,36,76,139,132,75,132,167,67,214,197,75,196,48,110,129,49]},"name":"All the Wrong Places by Phillip Connors EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
