Ryoko&apos;s past is shrouded in mystery, but the one concrete clue to her whereabouts is a previous address where she lived: in a compound in the heart of Tokyo, with a group that seems to be a cult led by a charismatic guru with a revisionist Buddhist scheme of life, death, and society. Narazaki plunges into the secretive world of the cult, ready to expose himself to any of the guru&apos;s brainwashing tactics if it means he can learn the truth about Ryoko. But the cult isn&apos;t what he expected, and he has no idea of the bubbling violence beneath its surface.\r\n\r\nInspired by the 1995 sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway, Cult X is an exploration of what draws individuals into extremism. This multi-faceted novel is nothing less than a tour de force, capturing the connections between astrophysics, neuroscience, and religion. It is an invective against predatory corporate consumerism and exploitative geopolitics, and it is a love story about compassion in the face of nihilism.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-05-23T12:01:21.566Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:d45f98aa04b8cdf7a5f11f0785a0cf29c7fab561","dn":"Cult X by Fuminori Nakamura EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"d45f98aa04b8cdf7a5f11f0785a0cf29c7fab561","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,95,152,170,4,184,205,247,165,241,31,7,133,160,207,41,199,250,181,97]},"name":"Cult X by Fuminori Nakamura EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
