While donating millions to the poor, he bombed and tortured his enemies - some had their eyeballs removed with hot spoons. Through ruthless cunning and America&apos;s insatiable appetite for cocaine, he became a multi-billionaire, who lived in a $100-million house with its own zoo.\r\n\r\nPablo Escobar: Beyond Narcos demolishes the standard good versus evil telling of his story. The authorities were not hunting Pablo down to stop his cocaine business. They were taking it over.\r\n\r\nShaun Attwood&apos;s War on Drugs trilogy - Pablo Escobar, American Made, and We Are Being Lied To - is a series of harrowing, action-packed and interlinked true stories that demonstrate the catastrophic consequences of drug prohibition.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-11-05T12:00:48.726Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea159668d608732e61eeb035a72f755921ed6f0d","dn":"Pablo Escobar_ Beyond Narcos by Shaun Attwood EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"ea159668d608732e61eeb035a72f755921ed6f0d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,21,150,104,214,8,115,46,97,238,176,53,167,47,117,89,33,237,111,13]},"name":"Pablo Escobar_ Beyond Narcos by Shaun Attwood EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
