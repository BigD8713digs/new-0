Not so long ago, he was a hustler in the Budayeen, an Arabian ghetto in a Balkanized future Earth. Back then, as often as not, he didn&apos;t have the money to buy himself a drink. But he had his independence. Now Marid works for Friedlander Bey, &quot;godfather&quot; of the Budayeen, a man whose power stretches across a shattered, crumbling world.\r\n\r\nDuring the day, Marid is a policemanand Bey&apos;s personal envoy to the police. His new position has brought him money and power which he would abandon in a moment if he could return to a life of neither owning nor being owned. Which, unfortunately, isn&apos;t one of his options.It&apos;s also not an issue. For something dark is afoot. Something that is sending the city into chaos.\r\n\r\nHelping a child-mutilator to avoid arrest. Sending a killer to murder Marid&apos;s partner. Murdering prostitutes and savaging their remains. Signs point to the hand of Abu Adil - the one man in the city whose power rivals Friedlander Bey&apos;s. Whatever happens next, it&apos;s not going to be good news for Marid Audran.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-07-31T12:01:19.699Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d65e5e9f9d5b393c643dd262355dc37d830bd80","dn":"A Fire in the Sun (Marid Audran series_book 2) by George Alec Ef","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"3d65e5e9f9d5b393c643dd262355dc37d830bd80","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,101,229,233,249,213,179,147,198,67,221,38,35,85,220,55,216,48,189,128]},"name":"A Fire in the Sun (Marid Audran series_book 2) by George Alec Ef","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
