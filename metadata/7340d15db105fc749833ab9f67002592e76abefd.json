He was the founder of American Heritage and Horizon magazines, the author of three books, and the editor of a dozen more. But at age 92, in the space of six months, he stopped reading or writing or carrying on detailed conversations. He could no longer tell time or make a phone call. He was convinced that the governor of Massachusetts had come to visit and was in the refrigerator.\r\n\r\nFive million Americans suffer from Alzheimer&apos;s, and like many of them, Joe Thorndike&apos;s one great desire was to remain in his own house. To honor his wish, his son John left his own home and moved into his father&apos;s upstairs bedroom on Cape Cod. For a year, in a house filled with file cabinets, photos, and letters, John explored his father&apos;s mind, his parents&apos; divorce, and his mother&apos;s secrets.\r\n\r\nThe Last of His Mind is the bittersweet account of a son&apos;s final year with his father, and a candid portrait of an implacable disease. It&apos;s the ordeal of Alzheimer&apos;s that draws father and son close, closer than they have been since John was a boy. At the end, when Joe&apos;s heart stops beating, John&apos;s hand is on his chest, and a story of painful decline has become a portrait of deep family ties, caregiving, and love.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-04-24T12:05:47.125Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:7340d15db105fc749833ab9f67002592e76abefd","dn":"The Last of His Mind by John Thorndike EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"7340d15db105fc749833ab9f67002592e76abefd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,64,209,93,177,5,252,116,152,51,171,159,103,0,37,146,231,106,190,253]},"name":"The Last of His Mind by John Thorndike EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
