The band&#x2019;s signature dream-folk sound remains intact on their debut for Minneapolis label/ collective Korda Records, which was founded by old friends and fellow Pennsylvanians, the Ocean Blue. \r\nJoining singer Karen Peris and husband Don Peris is longtime bassist Mike Bitts, and the couple&#x2019;s two children Anna and Drew Peris, who play violin on the song &#x201C;The Color Green.&#x201D; The record showcases a collection of songs that project the poignant clarity and humble focus that the veteran indie-folk group has become known for, and which led Sufjan Stevens to remark on NPR&#x2019;s All Songs Considered &#x201C;&#x2026;what I always come back to, after the din and drum roll, is the small song that makes careful observations about everyday life. This is what makes the music by The Innocence Mission so moving and profound.&#x201D; \r\n\r\nTracklist: \r\n1 - Hello I Feel the Same.flac \r\n2 - Tom on the Boulevard.flac \r\n3 - Washington Field Trip.flac \r\n4 - When the One Flowered Suitcase.flac \r\n5 - Barcelona.flac \r\n6 - State Park.flac \r\n7 - Fred Rogers.flac \r\n8 - Blue and Yellow.flac \r\n9 - Daily.flac \r\n10 - Spring Is Written on Your Door.flac \r\n11 - The Color Green.flac \r\n\r\nSummary: \r\nCountry: USA \r\nGenre: dream-pop, indie-folk","last_updated":"2018-07-13T12:07:38.240Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:e799a0ecd8be33e2250da939a6f1c07300c4dc06","dn":"[dream-pop, indie-folk] (2015) The Innocence Mission - Hello I F","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"e799a0ecd8be33e2250da939a6f1c07300c4dc06","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,153,160,236,216,190,51,226,37,13,169,57,166,241,192,115,0,196,220,6]},"name":"[dream-pop, indie-folk] (2015) The Innocence Mission - Hello I F","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
