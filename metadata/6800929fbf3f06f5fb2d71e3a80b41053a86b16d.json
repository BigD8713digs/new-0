In this fascinating autobiography, he shares stories about growing up in his nomadic tribe - from licking sweat off cows&#x2019; noses to survive a drought, to facing down a lion at age 14, to playing soccer for the president of Kenya. The only member of his family to receive a formal education, Joseph sometimes lived as much as 40 miles away from school. While at school, he learned about Western culture and traditions. A member of two very different communities, Joseph struggled with what he was taught and what he already knew. But eventually, he learned to balance two worlds.\r\n\r\nHailed by Children&#x2019;s Literature as a &quot;superb book for any age&quot;, Facing the Lion is a riveting tale of one man who took his destiny in his own hands and became an extraordinary citizen of the world.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-10-03T12:03:46.812Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:6800929fbf3f06f5fb2d71e3a80b41053a86b16d","dn":"Facing the Lion_ Growing Up Maasai on the African Savanna by Jos","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"6800929fbf3f06f5fb2d71e3a80b41053a86b16d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,0,146,159,191,63,6,245,251,45,113,227,168,11,65,5,58,134,177,109]},"name":"Facing the Lion_ Growing Up Maasai on the African Savanna by Jos","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
