What they have in common is a hunch about human psychology: that it&#x2019;s our constant effort to eliminate the negative that causes us to feel so anxious, insecure, and unhappy. And that there is an alternative &quot;negative path&quot; to happiness and success that involves embracing the things we spend our lives trying to avoid. It is a subversive, galvanizing message, which turns out to have a long and distinguished philosophical lineage ranging from ancient Roman Stoic philosophers to Buddhists. Oliver Burkeman talks to life coaches paid to make their clients&#x2019; lives a living hell, and to maverick security experts such as Bruce Schneier, who contends that the changes we&#x2019;ve made to airport and aircraft security since the 9/11 attacks have actually made us less safe. And then there are the &quot;backwards&quot; business gurus, who suggest not having any goals at all and not planning for a company&#x2019;s future.\r\n\r\nBurkeman&#x2019;s new book is a witty, fascinating, and counterintuitive read that turns decades of self-help advice on its head and forces us to rethink completely our attitudes toward failure, uncertainty, and death.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-10-04T12:02:27.388Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:15e62353c897ce6cc716d4ae67345cfd72c237af","dn":"The Antidote_ Happiness for People Who Can't Stand Positive Thin","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"15e62353c897ce6cc716d4ae67345cfd72c237af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,230,35,83,200,151,206,108,199,22,212,174,103,52,92,253,114,194,55,175]},"name":"The Antidote_ Happiness for People Who Can't Stand Positive Thin","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
