Welcome home! It&apos;s time to land on Mars and to establish the first active colony in the history of mankind on the Red Planet. All you need is supplies, oxygen, decades of hard training, survival skills in sandstorms and the determination with which you will have to understand the purpose of these strange black cubes that have emerged as if from nowhere. It will be a great place! If you clean up a little here. Surviving Mars is a science fiction simulator of the settlement, where your goal will be to colonize Mars and not die in the process. Choose a space agency that will provide you with logistics and financial support, then decide on a place for the colony. Build dome and other infrastructure, explore new opportunities, use drones to improve and expand your settlement. Cultivate food, minerals, or just relax in a bar after a heavy work shift. But most importantly - do not let the colonists die. Which is not the easiest task on an uncharted planet. You have to overcome many difficulties. Carefully work out the development strategy of the colony and do not forget to explore the secrets of the new world. You are ready?
