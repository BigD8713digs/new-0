Then it vanished.\r\n\r\nAs the Soviet Navy searched in vain for the lost vessel, a small, highly classified American operation using sophisticated deep-sea spy equipment found it&#x2014;wrecked on the sea floor at a depth of 16,800 feet, far beyond the capabilities of any salvage that existed. But the potential intelligence assets onboard the ship&#x2014;the nuclear warheads, battle orders, and cryptological machines&#x2014;justified going to extreme lengths to find a way to raise the submarine.\r\n\r\nSo began Project Azorian, a top-secret mission that took six years, cost an estimated $800 million, and would become the largest and most daring covert operation in CIA history.\r\n\r\nAfter the U.S. Navy declared retrieving the sub &#x201C;impossible,&#x201D; the mission fell to the CIA&apos;s burgeoning Directorate of Science and Technology, the little-known division responsible for the legendary U-2 and SR-71 Blackbird spy planes.\r\n\r\nWorking with Global Marine Systems, the country&apos;s foremost maker of exotic, deep-sea drilling vessels, the CIA commissioned the most expensive ship ever built and told the world that it belonged to the reclusive billionaire Howard Hughes, who would use the mammoth ship to mine rare minerals from the ocean floor.\r\n\r\nIn reality, a complex network of spies, scientists, and politicians attempted a project even crazier than Hughes&#x2019;s reputation: raising the sub directly under the watchful eyes of the Russians.\r\n\r\nThe Taking of K-129 is a riveting, almost unbelievable true-life tale of military history, engineering genius, and high-stakes spy-craft set during the height of the Cold War, when nuclear annihilation was a constant fear, and the opportunity to gain even the slightest advantage over your enemy was worth massive risk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJosh Dean is a New York based journalist whose work has appeared in Popular Science, Bloomberg BusinessWeek, GQ, Men&apos;s Journal, Rolling Stone, Inc., Fast Company, ESPN the Magazine, and many others","last_updated":"2017-09-06T12:07:24.272Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7977364ac3a2cbf2ac7e2ce1ea2f895584e2df9","dn":"The Taking of K-129: How the CIA Used Howard Hughes to Steal a R","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"b7977364ac3a2cbf2ac7e2ce1ea2f895584e2df9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,151,115,100,172,58,44,191,42,199,226,206,30,162,248,149,88,78,45,249]},"name":"The Taking of K-129: How the CIA Used Howard Hughes to Steal a R","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
