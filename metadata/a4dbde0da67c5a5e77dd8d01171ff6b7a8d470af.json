Well-dressed and unmarked, he had a half-smoked cigarette by his side, but no identity documents. Six decades on we don&#x2019;t know who he was, how he got there or how he died. Somerton Man remains one of Australia&#x2019;s most mysterious cold cases.\r\n\r\nYet it is the bizarre details of this case that make it the stuff of a spy novel. The missing labels from all his clothing. The tiny piece of paper with the words Tamam Shud found folded into a tiny bundle in his fob pocket. A mysterious code found etched inside the very book of Persian poetry from which this note was torn.\r\n\r\nBrimming with facts that are stranger than fiction, the case has intrigued novelist Kerry Greenwood for almost her whole life. She goes on a journey into her own past to try to solve this crime, uncovering a new way of writing about true crime &#x2013; and herself &#x2013; as she goes.\r\n\r\nPaperback: 232 pages\r\nPublisher: University of New South Wales Press (April 1, 2013)","last_updated":"2017-12-13T12:00:34.594Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4dbde0da67c5a5e77dd8d01171ff6b7a8d470af","dn":"Tamam Shud: The Somerton Man Mystery","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"a4dbde0da67c5a5e77dd8d01171ff6b7a8d470af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,219,222,13,166,124,90,94,119,221,141,1,23,31,246,183,168,212,112,175]},"name":"Tamam Shud: The Somerton Man Mystery","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
