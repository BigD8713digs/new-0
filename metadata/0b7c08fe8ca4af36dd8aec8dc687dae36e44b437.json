Fell: double bass\r\nPaul Hession: drum set\r\nRichard Comte: guitar\r\nPercy Pursglove: trumpet\r\n\r\nThe work is in three sections and the band immediately launches into a Morton-esque theme, bouncy and reasonably convincing, before quickly veering into a free improvisation featuring some blistering clarinet work from Ward. In microcosm, this is the model in use throughout: areas of thematic material interlaced or overlaid with a fairly aggressive but not atypical (within efi) improvised section, sometimes with written lines traced in the background, recalling (for me) a strategy used by Braxton among others. Different attacks and groupings are apparently scored with exactitude as the shifts within a given section are crisp and finely contrasting. All of the playing is first rate, especially Ward and Hutchings (the latter a name new to me) and I guess if you listen to the music from a post-Bailey, etc. point of view, you&apos;ll be well satisfied. - Brian Olewnick, JUST OUTSIDE","last_updated":"2017-07-30T12:03:48.646Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b7c08fe8ca4af36dd8aec8dc687dae36e44b437","dn":"Simon H.
