Her story is a chronicle of courage and faith, betrayal and treachery - set amidst the splendor, pageantry, squalor, and intrigue of 16th-century Europe.\r\n\r\nThe history of Mary Tudor is an improbable blend of triumph, humiliation, heartbreak, and devotion - and Ms. Erickson recounts it all against the turbulent background of European politics, war, and religious strife of the mid-1500s. The result is a rare portrait of the times and of a woman elevated to unprecedented power in a world ruled and defined by men.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-01-23T12:00:29.958Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:45979f61271dd2ae5086a6a786c607fb3ba76365","dn":"Bloody Mary by Carolly Erickson EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"45979f61271dd2ae5086a6a786c607fb3ba76365","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,151,159,97,39,29,210,174,80,134,166,167,134,198,7,251,59,167,99,101]},"name":"Bloody Mary by Carolly Erickson EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
