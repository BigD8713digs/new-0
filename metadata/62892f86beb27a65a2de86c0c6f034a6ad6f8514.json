Friedman\r\n\r\nSetting out to &quot;make intellectual and emotional sense of a man&apos;s relationship with his defining organ,&quot; David Friedman moves from highbrow to lowbrow in this lighthearted but substantive cultural history. Successively viewed as a life source, a symbol of a sacred covenant with God, an emblem of shame, an instrument of domination, a mere prop for the pharmaceutical companies, and finally, as simply a means of penetration-the penis has always been at the core of Western man&apos;s (and woman&apos;s) cultural evolution. With such luminaries as Leonardo da Vinci, Sigmund Freud, Walt Whitman, and Norman Mailer marking their territory on the subject, A Mind of Its Own is an intelligent and often hilarious account of man&apos;s complicated bond with his closest friend.\r\n\r\nCover:\r\n <a href=\"\nhttp://i.imgur.com/7Mw1J8k.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttp://i.imgur.com/7Mw1J8k.jpg</a>\r\n\r\nPublished by The Free Press, 2001\r\n\r\nEnglish, EPUB","last_updated":"2017-07-05T12:04:20.583Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:62892f86beb27a65a2de86c0c6f034a6ad6f8514","dn":"A Mind of its Own: A Cultural History of the Penis","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"62892f86beb27a65a2de86c0c6f034a6ad6f8514","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,137,47,134,190,178,122,101,162,222,134,192,198,240,52,166,173,111,133,20]},"name":"A Mind of its Own: A Cultural History of the Penis","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
