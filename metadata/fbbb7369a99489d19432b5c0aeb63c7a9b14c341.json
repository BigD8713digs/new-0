In a sequence of essays that excavate the past while laying bare the political upheaval of 2016, Ben Fountain argues that the United States may be facing a third existential crisis, one that will require a &#x201C;burning&#x201D; of the old order as America attempts to remake itself.\r\n\r\nGenre: Non-Fiction &gt; Educational","last_updated":"2018-09-25T12:16:52.951Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:fbbb7369a99489d19432b5c0aeb63c7a9b14c341","dn":"Beautiful Country Burn Again by Ben Fountain (.epub)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"fbbb7369a99489d19432b5c0aeb63c7a9b14c341","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,187,115,105,169,148,137,209,148,50,181,192,174,182,60,122,155,20,195,65]},"name":"Beautiful Country Burn Again by Ben Fountain (.epub)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
