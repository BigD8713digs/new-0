In it, he wrote up over 200 recipes for meat, poultry, game, salted and fresh fish, vegetables and sweet things in a chatty style aimed at readers who cooked on a modest budget. He showed that economic cookery could be delicious if flavors and aromas were blended with an appreciation for all sorts of ingredients, however humble, and for diverse food cultures, ranging from that of Aragon, his home region, to those of Iberian court and New World kitchens. \r\n\r\nThis first English translation gives guidelines for today&#x2019;s cooks alongside the original text, and interweaves a new narrative portraying 18th-century Spain, its everyday life, and food culture. The author traces links between New Art&#x2019;s dishes and modern Spanish cookery, tells the story of her search to identify the book&#x2019;s author and understand the popularity of his book for over 150 years, and takes travelers, cooks, historians, and students of Spanish language, culture, and gastronomy on a fascinating journey to the world of Altamiras and, most important of all, his kitchen","last_updated":"2017-08-06T12:00:54.125Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:6cf1a699af1b7aa1e93d14e7f086d4d5d885077d","dn":"New Art of Cookery - A Spanish Friar's Notebook (2017) Gooner","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"6cf1a699af1b7aa1e93d14e7f086d4d5d885077d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,241,166,153,175,27,122,161,233,61,20,231,240,134,212,213,216,133,7,125]},"name":"New Art of Cookery - A Spanish Friar's Notebook (2017) Gooner","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
