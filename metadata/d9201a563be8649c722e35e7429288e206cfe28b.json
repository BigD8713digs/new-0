Combining methods from history, astronomy, physics, and biology to draw together the big story arcs of how the universe was created, why planets formed, and how life developed, the result is a unique perspective of mankind&apos;s place in the universe.\r\n\r\nExcited by the alternative &quot;framework for all knowledge&quot; that is offered by this approach, Bill Gates is funding the Big History Project, which aims to bring this concept to a wider audience around the world.\r\n\r\nThe Little Book of Big History breaks down the main themes of Big History into highly informative and accessible parts for all readers to enjoy. By giving a truly complete timeline of world events, this book shines a whole different light on science as we learned it and makes us think of our history-and our future-in a very different way","last_updated":"2017-08-17T12:01:25.278Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9201a563be8649c722e35e7429288e206cfe28b","dn":"The Little Book of Big History The Story of the Universe, Human ","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"d9201a563be8649c722e35e7429288e206cfe28b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,32,26,86,59,232,100,156,114,46,53,231,66,146,136,226,6,207,226,139]},"name":"The Little Book of Big History The Story of the Universe, Human ","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
