Scott Fitzgerald&#x2019;s career is slowly drowning in booze. But the once-famous author, desperate to make money penning scripts for the silver screen, is charismatic enough to attract the gorgeous Miss Graham, a woman who exposes the secrets of others while carefully guarding her own. Like Fitzgerald&#x2019;s hero Jay Gatsby, Graham has meticulously constructed a life far removed from the poverty of her childhood in London&#x2019;s slums. And like Gatsby, the onetime guttersnipe learned early how to use her charms to become a hardworking success; she is feted and feared by both the movie studios and their luminaries. A notorious drunk famously married to the doomed Zelda, Fitzgerald fell hard for his &#x201C;Shielah&#x201D;&#x9D; (he never learned to spell her name), a shrewd yet softhearted woman-both a fool for love and nobody&#x2019;s fool-who would stay with him and help revive his career until his tragic death three years later. Working from Sheilah&#x2019;s memoirs, interviews, and letters, Sally Koslow revisits their scandalous love affair and Graham&#x2019;s dramatic transformation in London, bringing Graham and Fitzgerald gloriously to life with the color, glitter, magic, and passion of 1930s Hollywood","last_updated":"2018-07-06T12:03:40.915Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:85fd0471ed8f6e1edd3c1e6610c1f77b3304f6df","dn":"Another Side of Paradise","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"85fd0471ed8f6e1edd3c1e6610c1f77b3304f6df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,253,4,113,237,143,110,30,221,60,30,102,16,193,247,123,51,4,246,223]},"name":"Another Side of Paradise","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
