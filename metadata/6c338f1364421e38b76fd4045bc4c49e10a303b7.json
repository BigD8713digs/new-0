But when a car accident reveals her husband&apos;s secret life as a serial killer, she must remake herself as Gwen Proctor - the ultimate warrior mom.\r\n\r\nWith her ex now in prison, Gwen has finally found refuge in a new home on remote Stillhouse Lake. Though still the target of stalkers and Internet trolls who think she had something to do with her husband&apos;s crimes, Gwen dares to think her kids can finally grow up in peace.\r\n\r\nBut just when she&apos;s starting to feel at ease in her new identity, a body turns up in the lake - and threatening letters start arriving from an all-too-familiar address. Gwen Proctor must keep friends close and enemies at bay to avoid being exposed - or watch her kids fall victim to a killer who takes pleasure in tormenting her. One thing is certain: she&apos;s learned how to fight evil. And she&apos;ll never stop.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-09-03T12:03:47.730Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c338f1364421e38b76fd4045bc4c49e10a303b7","dn":"Stillhouse Lake by Rachel Caine ePUB eBOOK-ZAK","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"6c338f1364421e38b76fd4045bc4c49e10a303b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,51,143,19,100,66,30,56,183,111,212,4,91,196,196,158,16,163,3,183]},"name":"Stillhouse Lake by Rachel Caine ePUB eBOOK-ZAK","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
