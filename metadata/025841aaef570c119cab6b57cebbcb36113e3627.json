He made this project because he had ideas that didn&apos;t fit into Darkthrone; he didn&apos;t want Darkthrone to become progressive. The main inspirations are Norwegian culture and old superstition, and the music can be described as a mixture of Folk/Doom/Death and Black Metal.\r\n\r\nTwo albums were recorded and released by Fenriz. The first album (Vinterskugge), which was actually 3 demos put together, was released in 1994 through Deaf. Records (Part of Peaceville). The 3 demos were: &quot;Spectres Over Gorgoroth,&quot; which was originally released in 1989; &quot;Horizons&quot; originally released in 1991; and &quot;Vandreren&quot; released in 1993.\r\n\r\nThe second album was released in 1995 through Moonfog. Its title was &quot;H&#xF8;stm&#xF8;rke.&quot; Half of the songs were sung in Norwegian.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDiscography:\r\n\r\nSpectres over Gorgoroth - Demo, 1989 FLAC\r\n\r\nHorizons - 1991 FLAC\r\n\r\nVandreren - Demo, 1993 FLAC\r\n\r\nVandreren - 1993 FLAC\r\n\r\nVinterskugge - Compilation, 1994 FLAC\r\n\r\nH&#xF8;stm&#xF8;rke - Full-length, 1995 FLAC\r\n\r\nTraditional Doom Cult - EP, 2016 MP3","last_updated":"2018-05-29T12:12:22.670Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:025841aaef570c119cab6b57cebbcb36113e3627","dn":"Isengard Discography 1989-2016","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"025841aaef570c119cab6b57cebbcb36113e3627","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,88,65,170,239,87,12,17,156,171,107,87,206,187,203,54,17,62,54,39]},"name":"Isengard Discography 1989-2016","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
