Now she shares those recipes, techniques and shortcuts so you too can cook with real Indian flavours without compromising on taste or texture. \r\nEmbrace weekday dinners with mustard coconut and chilli-slathered baked fish, wok-friendly Goan chilli beef fry or silken kofta curry made with packs of ready-rolled meatballs. For leisurely weekends, tuck into a feast of Vindaloo pulled pork; give your Sunday roast a sumptuous twist with spicy marinades or enjoy a whole roasted cauliflower encrusted with nut butter. Brunch as Indians do with dosas and whole moong crepes; entertain with crowd pleasing do-it-yourself Calcutta kati rolls, easy-to-assemble platters of baby aubergines drenched in peanut, sesame and coconut, and much, much more.\r\n\r\nHardcover: 256 pages\r\nPublisher: Bloomsbury Publishing (July 31, 2018)\r\nLanguage: English\r\nISBN-10: 140888688X\r\nISBN-13: 978-1408886885\r\n <a href=\"\nhttps://www.amazon.co.uk/Masala-Indian-Cooking-Modern-Living/dp/140888688X\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://www.amazon.co.uk/Masala-Indian-Cooking-Modern-Living/dp/140888688X</a>","last_updated":"2018-09-08T12:14:42.732Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:de274ecf1ac13452f51a593152c153344fc4536a","dn":"Masala: Indian Cooking for Modern Living - Mallika Basu 2018 epu","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"de274ecf1ac13452f51a593152c153344fc4536a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,39,78,207,26,193,52,82,245,26,89,49,82,193,83,52,79,196,83,106]},"name":"Masala: Indian Cooking for Modern Living - Mallika Basu 2018 epu","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
