For Jay, a retired research scientist who sees the world through a mathematician&apos;s unforgiving eyes, this return to the classroom is his &quot;one last chance&quot; to learn the great literature he&apos;d neglected in his youth - and, even more, a final opportunity to more fully understand his son, a writer and classicist. But through the sometimes uncomfortable months that the two men explore Homer&apos;s great work together - first in the classroom, where Jay persistently challenges his son&apos;s interpretations, and then during a surprise-filled Mediterranean journey retracing Odysseus&apos;s famous voyages - it becomes clear that Daniel has much to learn, too: Jay&apos;s responses to both the text and the travels gradually uncover long-buried secrets that allow the son to understand his difficult father at last. As this intricately woven memoir builds to its wrenching climax, Mendelsohn&apos;s narrative comes to echo the Odyssey itself, with its timeless themes of deception and recognition, marriage and children, the pleasures of travel and the meaning of home. Rich with literary and emotional insight, An Odyssey is a renowned author-scholar&apos;s most triumphant entwining yet of personal narrative and literary exploration.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-09-18T12:03:49.962Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ecd7496a606f0f50439f70315d902ebfd63645f","dn":"An Odyssey_ A Father, a Son, and an Epic by Daniel Mendelsohn eP","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"5ecd7496a606f0f50439f70315d902ebfd63645f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,205,116,150,166,6,240,245,4,57,247,3,21,217,2,235,253,99,100,95]},"name":"An Odyssey_ A Father, a Son, and an Epic by Daniel Mendelsohn eP","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
