Proud Mary\r\n\r\nOn July 4, 1987, 25 years ago today, HBO broadcasted a special concert event \r\nentitled Welcome Home. The concert was designed to raise money to support homeless Viet Nam veterans. The roster for the show included Stevie Wonder, CSN, Linda Ronstadt, Kris Kristofferson and Neil Diamond, with John Fogerty closing the night. According to the notes that accompanied this tape, during rehearsals, Fogerty played only solo material, as he was still in a dispute with his record company over his recordings with Creedence. When he hit the stage, he seemed intent on continuing to ignore his past, as the band began playing Old Man Down The Road. And then it happened, one of those magical moments that occur just once in a musical lifetime. Fogerty stopped, huddled up with his band mates, and then launched into Born on The Bayou! The rest of the set was all Creedence classics, including Bad Moon Rising. Who&#x2019;ll Stop The Rain, Down On The Corner and Proud Mary, just to name a few. From that show forward, CCR material would again grace every Fogerty concert!","last_updated":"2017-11-19T12:05:26.661Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:f585bb8085262dc9c12c9a0b911450303fce1513","dn":"John Fogerty CCR songs first time solo live 1987-07-04 SBD FLAC","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"f585bb8085262dc9c12c9a0b911450303fce1513","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,133,187,128,133,38,45,201,193,44,154,11,145,20,80,48,63,206,21,19]},"name":"John Fogerty CCR songs first time solo live 1987-07-04 SBD FLAC","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
