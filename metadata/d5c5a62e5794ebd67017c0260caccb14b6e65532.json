These two men are the ax to the frozen sea that is Rebecca&apos;s spirit, and what flows forth is a passion for all things German. First love might be fleeting, but Kafka is forever, and in pursuit of this elusive passion Rebecca will spend two decades stuttering and stumbling through German sentences, trying to win over a people who can&apos;t be bothered.\r\n\r\nSchadenfreude, a Love Story is an exhilarating, hilarious, and yes, maybe even heartfelt memoir proving that sometimes the truest loves play hard to get.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-07-11T12:00:21.258Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:d5c5a62e5794ebd67017c0260caccb14b6e65532","dn":"Rebecca Schuman - Schadenfreude a Love Story 2017 RETAiL ePUB eB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"d5c5a62e5794ebd67017c0260caccb14b6e65532","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,197,166,46,87,148,235,214,112,23,192,38,12,172,203,20,182,230,85,50]},"name":"Rebecca Schuman - Schadenfreude a Love Story 2017 RETAiL ePUB eB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
