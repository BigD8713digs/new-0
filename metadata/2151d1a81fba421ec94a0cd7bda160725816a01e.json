In an instant, she became a member of a club no one wants to belong to&#x2014;a group of similar survivors known in the press as the Final Girls. Lisa, who lost nine sorority sisters to a college dropout&#x2019;s knife; Sam, who went up against the Sack Man during her shift at the Nightlight Inn; and now Quincy, who ran bleeding through the woods to escape Pine Cottage and the man she refers to only as Him. The three girls are all attempting to put their nightmares behind them, and, with that, one another. Despite the media&#x2019;s attempts, they never meet.\r\n\r\nEnjoy &amp; Seed to Let others enjoy!","last_updated":"2017-07-26T12:03:15.104Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:2151d1a81fba421ec94a0cd7bda160725816a01e","dn":"Final Girls - Riley Sager (MojoBB)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"2151d1a81fba421ec94a0cd7bda160725816a01e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,81,209,168,31,186,66,30,201,74,12,215,189,161,96,114,88,22,160,30]},"name":"Final Girls - Riley Sager (MojoBB)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
