Within hours her crew may be able to reach Sol System through a hidden time gate. If they make it, she and her crew won&apos;t just save their own lives - they&apos;ll save millions from genocide at the hands of Luddeccean fanatics.\r\n\r\nBut the Luddeccean &quot;fanatics&quot; may not be as mad as Noa believes.\r\n\r\nIf the Ark reaches Sol, Professor James Sinclair will be revealed as the imposter he is.
