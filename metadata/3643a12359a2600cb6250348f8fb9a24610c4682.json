Is better to teach that good deeds indeed are the measure of\r\na good soul, they would suggest,  rather than what some fundamentalist Christian\r\nchurches seem to say in believing in being saved by grace alone\r\n\r\nOh the other hand, what good deeds do you consider you are involved in when you \r\nengage in the killing of Christian priests *as depicted in this movie affair) who\r\nrightly practice their faith in good spirit rather than that of fundamentalism\r\nnonsense which sees judicial amputations for those accused of theft,\r\nstoning for instances of so-called adultery, flogging for having had a drink of\r\nwine, and a restriction on listening to music etc that some preach in sharia\r\ncontrolled areas equally?\r\n\r\nIn the end, I don&apos;t believe that since we don&apos;t define what is to be considered\r\ngood to believe or engage in as a human race, its best to keep to our own unless \r\nwe are clear that it is a universally human thing to consider being involved\r\nin before we try to teach it to others or prevail in their midst I believe.\r\n\r\nThanks for seeding\r\n\r\nMichael Rizzo Chessman\r\n(moviesbyrizzo) \r\n\r\nPS at the time of this posting, we are still seeding our 1.2GB 720p version\r\nof this movie which uses the same subs - we have add even more subtitles here","last_updated":"2018-09-14T12:00:58.531Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:3643a12359a2600cb6250348f8fb9a24610c4682","dn":"Of Gods and Men (2010) 1080p H.264 (moviesbyrizzo) multisub","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"3643a12359a2600cb6250348f8fb9a24610c4682","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,67,161,35,89,162,96,12,182,37,3,72,248,251,154,36,97,12,70,130]},"name":"Of Gods and Men (2010) 1080p H.264 (moviesbyrizzo) multisub","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
