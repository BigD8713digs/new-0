Best-selling author Andrew Collins has uncovered an astronomy that is about 17,000 years old, with standing stones, temples, and monuments across the globe oriented towards Cygnus&#x2019;s stars. He also found that the use of deep caves by Palaeolithic man led to the rise of religious thought and the belief in life&#x2019;s stellar origins. Now modern-day technology has confirmed that high-energy particles come from a binary star known as Cygnus X3. Ancient people knew what science is finally verifying: that the DNA of life came originally from deep space.\r\n\r\nPaperback: 384 pages\r\nPublisher: Watkins; First U.S. Printing edition (April 6, 2010)","last_updated":"2017-12-30T12:00:26.791Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:4a6f40ea1be2cb3478258baaa2535c8008fc16f9","dn":"The Cygnus Mystery: Life's Origins in the Cosmos","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"4a6f40ea1be2cb3478258baaa2535c8008fc16f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,111,64,234,27,226,203,52,120,37,139,170,162,83,92,128,8,252,22,249]},"name":"The Cygnus Mystery: Life's Origins in the Cosmos","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
