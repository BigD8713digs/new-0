You are Amelia Cross, a stranded archaeologist who has mysteriously awoken among the sand swept ruins of an ancient alien landscape. Together with the distant help of another survivor, Commander Emma Sutcliffe, you must traverse and manipulate the structure of this forgotten world to find a way back home.\r\n\r\nWaking up wearing a strange suit with attached gloves, you have no prior knowledge on how you came to be in this environment.
