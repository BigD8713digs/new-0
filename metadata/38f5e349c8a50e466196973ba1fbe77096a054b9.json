Can the NUMA crew crack it in time? Sea of Greed is the suspenseful new NUMA Files novels from the #1 New York Times-bestselling grand master of adventure.\r\n\r\nAfter an explosion in the Gulf of Mexico destroys three oil rigs trying to revive a dying field, Kurt Austin and the NUMA Special Projects Team are tapped by the President of the United States to find out what&apos;s gone wrong. The trail leads them to a brilliant billionaire in the alternative energy field. Her goal is the end of the oil age; her company has spent billions developing the worlds&apos; most advanced fuel-cell systems. But is she an environmental hero...or a rogue genetic engineer?\r\n\r\nThe NUMA crew discovers that the oil fields are infected with bacteria that are consuming the oil before it can be pumped out of the earth--a bacteria originally lost decades ago when two submarines vanished in the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\nWith hired killers on his trail, can Kurt Austin locate a submarine that&apos;s remained hidden for more than fifty years? And even if he can, can the biological terror that&apos;s been unleashed be stopped?\r\n\r\nGenre: Fiction &gt; Action &amp; Adventure","last_updated":"2018-11-07T12:22:54.319Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:38f5e349c8a50e466196973ba1fbe77096a054b9","dn":"Sea of Greed (NUMA Files #16) by Clive Cussler (.epub)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"38f5e349c8a50e466196973ba1fbe77096a054b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,245,227,73,200,165,14,70,97,150,151,59,161,251,231,112,150,160,84,185]},"name":"Sea of Greed (NUMA Files #16) by Clive Cussler (.epub)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
