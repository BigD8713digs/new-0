The daughter of East German emigrants encounters her doppelg&#xE4;nger, who has crossed another cultural divide. Twin brothers fall for the same girl. When a stripper receives an enigmatic proposal from a client, she accepts, ignorant of its terms.\r\n\r\nShadows, doubles, and the ghosts of past and future lovers haunt these elegantly structured and often hallucinatory stories. The language is hypnotic, deadpan, intense; the sentences jewel-hard and sublime. This marks the d&#xE9;but of a stylish, exuberant new voice in modern fiction.\r\n\r\nGenre: Fiction &gt; General Fiction/Classics","last_updated":"2018-10-06T12:19:47.989Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:695ef534918de139836f7f12429f0814a11d4e54","dn":"Things to Make and Break by May-lan Tan (.epub)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"695ef534918de139836f7f12429f0814a11d4e54","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,94,245,52,145,141,225,57,131,111,127,18,66,159,8,20,161,29,78,84]},"name":"Things to Make and Break by May-lan Tan (.epub)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
