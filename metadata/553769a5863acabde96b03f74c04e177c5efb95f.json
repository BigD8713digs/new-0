Gary is a country boy turned pop star who is spinning out of control. Justin is in Shanghai to expand his family&apos;s real estate empire, only to find that he might not be up to the task. He has long harbored a crush on Yinghui, a poetry-loving, left-wing activist who has reinvented herself as a successful Shanghai businesswoman. Yinghui is about to make a deal with the shadowy Walter Chao, the five star billionaire of the novel, who with his secrets and his schemes has a hand in the lives of each of the characters. All bring their dreams and hopes to Shanghai, the shining symbol of the New China, which, like the story&apos;s characters, is constantly in flux and which plays its own fateful role in the lives of its inhabitants.\r\n\r\nFive Star Billionaire is a dazzling, kaleidoscopic book that offers rare insight into the booming world of Shanghai, a city of elusive identities and ever-changing skylines, of grand ambitions and outsize dreams. Bursting with energy, contradictions, and the promise of possibility, Tash Aw&apos;s remarkable new book is both poignant and comic, exotic and familiar, cutting-edge and classic, suspenseful and yet beautifully unhurried.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-12-06T12:00:28.609Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:553769a5863acabde96b03f74c04e177c5efb95f","dn":"Five Star Billionaire by Tash Aw EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"553769a5863acabde96b03f74c04e177c5efb95f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,55,105,165,134,58,202,189,233,107,3,247,76,4,225,119,197,239,185,95]},"name":"Five Star Billionaire by Tash Aw EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
