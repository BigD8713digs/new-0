With Diggle back in the military and Thea adamant about hanging up her hood as Speedy, Team Green Arrow is down to just Oliver and Felicity &#x2013; but they&#x2019;re no longer the only vigilantes in town. Green Arrow&#x2019;s public defeat of Damien Darhk at the end of Season Four has inspired a new crop of masked heroes to step up and defend the city, though their painful inexperience makes them obstacles, rather than allies, in the field. The arrival of a deadly new adversary will force Oliver to confront questions about his own legacy, both as mayor and as the Green Arrow.\r\n\r\n\r\nStars: Stephen Amell,David Ramsey,Willa Holland,Emily Bett Rickards,Echo Kellum,Josh Segarra,Paul Blackthorne. \r\n\r\n\r\n#   Episode name                         Original airdate\r\n\r\n1   Legacy                               October 5, 2016\r\n2   The Recruits                         October 12, 2016\r\n3   A Matter of Trust                    October 19, 2016\r\n4   Penance                              October 26, 2016\r\n5   Human Target                         November 2, 2016\r\n6   So It Begins                         November 9, 2016\r\n7   Vigilante                            November 16, 2016\r\n8   Invasion!
