He won the 1971 Nobel Prize for Literature &quot;for a poetry that with the action of an elemental force brings alive a continent&apos;s destiny and dreams.&quot;  Gabriel Garc&#xED;a M&#xE1;rquez called him &quot;the greatest poet of the 20th century -- in any language.&quot;\n\nNeruda wrote in a wide variety of styles, including surrealist poems, historical epics, overtly political manifestos, a prose autobiography, and erotically charged love poems that are widely regarded as some of the most romantic ever written.  In a famous essay, &quot;On Impure Poetry&quot; (included in Belitt&apos;s edition of SELECTED POEMS), Neruda calls for &quot;a poetry as impure as old clothes, as a body with its foodstains and its shame, with wrinkles, observations, dreams, wakefulness, prophesies, declarations of love and hate, stupidities, shocks, idylls, political beliefs, negations, doubts, affirmations, and taxes.&quot;\n\nThis collection features a large selection of his poetical works, many in bilingual editions.  Highlights include TWENTY LOVE POEMS (1924) that launched him into the international spotlight; RESIDENCE ON EARTH (1933), a collection of esoteric surrealistic poems which marked a literary breakthrough; CANTO GENERAL (1950), an epic poem tracing the history of Latin America and evoking the grandeur of its landscape; SELECTED ODES (1954-57); THE CAPTAIN&apos;S VERSES (1963), passionately sensuous and exploding with all the erotic energy of a new love; ISLA NEGRA (1964), where Neruda &quot;in the company of his muse, walked alongside the source of his most lyrical inspiration, the sea ... and discovered a new way of seeing, as the ocean became a living metaphor for the infinite riches of the world&quot;; and THE BOOK OF QUESTIONS (1973), finished only a month before his death and composed of 316 unanswerable questions, by turns Orphic, comic, surreal, and poignant.\n\nIn his MEMOIRS (1974), Neruda explains his views on poetry and describes the circumstances that inspired many of his poems, and creates a revealing record of his life as a poet, a patriot, and one of the twentieth century&apos;s true men of conscience.  PASSIONS AND IMPRESSIONS (1978) is both a sequel to and an enlargement of the Memoirs, recording a lifetime of travel, of friendships and enmities, of exile and homecoming, of loss and discovery, and of history both public and personal.  Above all, it is a testament to Neruda&apos;s love for Chile -- for its citizens, its flora and fauna, and its national identity.\n\nThis is an update of a previous torrent.
