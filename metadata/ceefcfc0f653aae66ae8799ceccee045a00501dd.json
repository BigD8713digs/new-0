Self-discovery, it turns out, comes through looking outward, not inward. Power comes from holding back. Good relationships come from small gestures. Spontaneity comes from practice. And excellence comes from what you choose to do, not your &quot;natural&quot; abilities.\r\n\r\nCounterintuitive. Countercultural. Even revolutionary. These powerful ideas have made Professor Michael Puett&apos;s course the third most popular at Harvard University in recent years, with enrollment surging every year since it was first offered in 2006. It&apos;s clear students are drawn by a bold promise Professor Puett makes on the first day of class: &quot;These ideas will change your life&quot;. Now he offers his course to the world.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-01-28T12:11:23.635Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:ceefcfc0f653aae66ae8799ceccee045a00501dd","dn":"The Path_ What Chinese Philosophers Can Teach Us EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"ceefcfc0f653aae66ae8799ceccee045a00501dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,239,207,192,246,83,170,230,106,232,121,156,236,206,224,69,160,5,1,221]},"name":"The Path_ What Chinese Philosophers Can Teach Us EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
