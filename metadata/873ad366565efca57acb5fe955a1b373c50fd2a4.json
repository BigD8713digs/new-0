Intended as an introduction to the subject and drawing heavily on contemporary first-person accounts, the book creates a vivid but balanced mosaic of the many thousands of mercenaries who were hired to fight for various employers.\r\n\r\nHunt Janin is an American writer living in southwestern France. He has written numerous nonfiction and scholarly books on a range of subjects, including medieval history and cross-cultural studies.\r\n\r\nUrsula Carlson is a professor emerita at Western Nevada College, Carson City, Nevada.\r\n\r\nPaperback: 220 pages\r\nPublisher: McFarland (July 3, 2013)","last_updated":"2017-07-27T12:00:33.041Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:873ad366565efca57acb5fe955a1b373c50fd2a4","dn":"Mercenaries in Medieval and Renaissance Europe","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"873ad366565efca57acb5fe955a1b373c50fd2a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,58,211,102,86,94,252,165,122,203,95,233,85,161,179,115,197,15,210,164]},"name":"Mercenaries in Medieval and Renaissance Europe","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
