We are more likely to trust the words found in a history textbook over the version of history retold by a friend &#x2013; after all, human memory is unreliable, and how can you be sure your friend hasn&apos;t embellished the facts? But before humans were writing down their knowledge, they were telling it to each other in the form of stories. \r\n\r\nThe Edge of Memory celebrates the predecessor of written information &#x2013; the spoken word, tales from our ancestors that have been passed down, transmitting knowledge from one generation to the next. Among the most extensive and best-analysed of these stories are from native Australian cultures. These stories conveyed both practical information and recorded history, describing a lost landscape, often featuring tales of flooding and submergence. These folk traditions are increasingly supported by hard science. Geologists are starting to corroborate the tales through study of climatic data, sediments and land forms; the evidence was there in the stories, but until recently, nobody was listening.\r\n\r\nGenre: Non-Fiction &gt; General","last_updated":"2018-09-21T12:24:53.367Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:62dae004a46827c83887c7967bc78bca692e63d9","dn":"The Edge of Memory by Patrick Nunn (.epub)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"62dae004a46827c83887c7967bc78bca692e63d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,218,224,4,164,104,39,200,56,135,199,150,123,199,139,202,105,46,99,217]},"name":"The Edge of Memory by Patrick Nunn (.epub)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
