In contrast to the nervous twitches of the opening &quot;In a space of tactile familiarity&quot;, which in feel looks over its shoulder to earlier models of improvised music (Flinn&apos;s scattery chattery percussion extends the Paul Lovens / Roger Turner axis impressively), &quot;Defamiliarizing the table&quot; begins with an ominous rash of amp buzz from Drake and unpitched breath effects from Heenan, a vocabulary that belongs to more recent developments in improv. &quot;Nearby objects leading others to recede&quot; is equally slowmoving, though more concerned with pitch. The album throughout aims to steer a course between the opposite aesthetic extremes of high speed gabbiness and near-static micro-improv (several thousand miles away a similar schizophrenia pervades the music of Norway&apos;s No Spaghetti collective), which testifies impressively to the musicians&apos; breadth of knowledge but leaves the listener unsure as to where precisely to situate the musicians. - paristransatlantic.com","last_updated":"2017-07-30T12:03:54.341Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:816b16c4017a900643bb6b37a5db6b10e42c94fa","dn":"Jeremy Drake, Stephen Flinn, Chris Heenan 2004 Team Up","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"816b16c4017a900643bb6b37a5db6b10e42c94fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,107,22,196,1,122,144,6,67,187,107,55,165,219,107,16,228,44,148,250]},"name":"Jeremy Drake, Stephen Flinn, Chris Heenan 2004 Team Up","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
