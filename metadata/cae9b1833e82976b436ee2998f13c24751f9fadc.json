They were in demand in Canada, the United Sates, England and Germany. In fact it seemed their popularity was traveling more than they were. There was the feeling that the band could tour forever.\r\n\r\nWhether writing the songs, producing them, or promoting them, Myles Goodwyn had been working against some kind of &#x201C;deadline&#x201D; for the last three years with no significant time off. He needed a break&#x2026; so he took one. After a hiatus of 18 months, during which the band recorded Power Play with such cutting edge hits as Anything You Want You Got It and Enough is Enough, the band was ready to tour again. The 1982 Power Play tour was the largest tour April Wine had ever attempted.\r\n\r\n\r\nTrack List:\r\n\r\n01 - Oowatanite\r\n02 - Future Tense\r\n03 - Crash &amp; Burn\r\n04 - Before The Dawn\r\n05 - All Over Town\r\n06 - Big City Girls\r\n07 - Ladies Man\r\n08 - Sign Of The Gypsy Queen\r\n09 - Just Between You And Me\r\n10 - 20th Century Schizoid Man\r\n11 - I Like To Rock\r\n12 - Wanna Rock\r\n13 - Roller\r\n\r\nPlayers\r\n\r\nMyles Goodwyn &#x2013; vocals, guitar (1969-1986, 1992&#x2013;Present)\r\nBrian Greenway &#x2013; vocals, guitar (1977-1986, 1992&#x2013;Present)\r\nGary Moffet &#x2013; guitar, backing vocals (1973-1984)\r\nJerry Mercer &#x2013; drums (1973-1984, 1992-2008)\r\nSteve Lang &#x2013; bass, backing vocals (1975-1984; died 2017)","last_updated":"2017-10-18T12:01:43.149Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:cae9b1833e82976b436ee2998f13c24751f9fadc","dn":"April Wine -Aladdan Theater  Las Vegas,1981 ak320","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"cae9b1833e82976b436ee2998f13c24751f9fadc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,233,177,131,62,130,151,107,67,110,226,153,143,19,194,71,81,249,250,220]},"name":"April Wine -Aladdan Theater  Las Vegas,1981 ak320","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
