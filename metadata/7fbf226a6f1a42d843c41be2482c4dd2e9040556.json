Kennedy that gets closer to the man than any book before, by best-selling author Chris Matthews, an esteemed Kennedy expert and anchor of MSNBC&apos;s Hardball. \r\n\r\nWith his best-selling biography Jack Kennedy, Chris Matthews shared a new look at one of America&apos;s most beloved presidents and the patriotic spirit that defined him. Now, with Bobby Kennedy, Matthews returns with a gripping, in-depth, behind-the-scenes portrait of one of the great figures of the American 20th century. \r\n\r\nOverlooked by his father and overshadowed by his war hero brother, Bobby Kennedy was the perpetual underdog. When he had the chance to become a naval officer like Jack, Bobby turned it down, choosing instead to join the navy as a common sailor. It was a life-changing experience that led him to connect with voters from all walks of life: young or old, black or white, rich or poor. They were the people who turned out for him in his 1968 campaign. RFK would prove himself to be the rarest of politicians - both a pragmatist who knew how to get the job done and an unwavering idealist who could inspire millions. \r\n\r\nDrawing on extensive research and interviews, Matthews pulls back the curtain on the public and private worlds of Robert Francis Kennedy. He shines a light on all the important moments of his life, from his early years and his start in politics to his crucial role as attorney general in his brother&apos;s administration and his tragic run for president. This definitive book brings Bobby Kennedy to life like never before and is destined to become a political classic. \r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-11-30T12:00:44.096Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:7fbf226a6f1a42d843c41be2482c4dd2e9040556","dn":"Bobby Kennedy_ A Raging Spirit by Chris Matthews EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"7fbf226a6f1a42d843c41be2482c4dd2e9040556","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,191,34,106,111,26,66,216,67,196,27,226,72,44,77,210,233,4,5,86]},"name":"Bobby Kennedy_ A Raging Spirit by Chris Matthews EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
