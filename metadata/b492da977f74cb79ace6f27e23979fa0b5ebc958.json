But sometimes, this emotional attachment to our belongings can spiral out of control and culminate into a condition called compulsive hoarding. From hobbyists and collectors to pack rats and compulsive shoppers - it is close to impossible for hoarders to relinquish their precious objects, even if it means that stuff takes over their lives and their homes.\r\n\r\nAccording to psychologist Dr. Robin Zasio, our fascination with hoarding stems from the fact that most of us fall somewhere on the hoarding continuum. Even though it may not regularly interfere with our everyday lives, to some degree or another, many of us hoard.\r\n\r\nThe Hoarder in You provides practical advice for decluttering and organizing, including how to tame the emotional pull of acquiring additional things, make order out of chaos by getting a handle on clutter, and create an organizational system that reduces stress and anxiety. Dr. Zasio also shares some of the most serious cases of hoarding that she&#x2019;s encountered, and explains how we can learn from these extreme examples - no matter where we are on the hoarding continuum.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-10-17T12:07:17.727Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:b492da977f74cb79ace6f27e23979fa0b5ebc958","dn":"The Hoarder in You by Dr. Robin Zasio EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"b492da977f74cb79ace6f27e23979fa0b5ebc958","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,146,218,151,127,116,203,121,172,230,242,126,35,151,159,160,181,235,201,88]},"name":"The Hoarder in You by Dr. Robin Zasio EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
