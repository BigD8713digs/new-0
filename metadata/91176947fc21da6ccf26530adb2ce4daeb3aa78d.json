They live on the paradise Indonesian island of Sulawesi with the rest of their gang of crested black macaques. These very special primates are found nowhere else in the world. Twenty-five years ago, wildlife cameraman Colin Stafford-Johnson visited Sulawesi for the first time and now he&apos;s returned. Fascinated by the monkeys, Colin hopes to reveal their sometimes violent, often playful and, just like our own, highly political world. What he discovers leads him on a much bigger journey than he was ever expecting.\r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n * Video Codec: x265/HEVC CABAC Main10 L4\r\n * Video Bitrate: CRF 21 (~3335Kbps)\r\n * Video Resolution: 1920x1080\r\n * Frame Rate: 25 FPS\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC-LC\r\n * Audio Bitrate: Q=0.45 VBR 48KHz (~148Kbps)\r\n * Audio Channels: 2\r\n * Run-Time: 53 mins\r\n * Part Size: 1.30 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Subtitles: Merged","last_updated":"2018-08-23T12:02:50.166Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:91176947fc21da6ccf26530adb2ce4daeb3aa78d","dn":"BBC Natural World 2013 Meet the Monkeys 1080p x265 AAC HDTV MVGr","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"91176947fc21da6ccf26530adb2ce4daeb3aa78d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,23,105,71,252,33,218,108,207,38,83,10,219,44,228,218,235,58,167,141]},"name":"BBC Natural World 2013 Meet the Monkeys 1080p x265 AAC HDTV MVGr","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
