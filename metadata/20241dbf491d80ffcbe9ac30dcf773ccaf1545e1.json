Things were just too perfect. By the time he had seen the second explosion at Westminster Abbey, he knew that he was hunting much more than just a lone terrorist. Ward is the man who has no country, yet is the most efficient operative in the mystical team simply known as The Deniables.\r\nIn pursuit of the terrorist, Ward discovers a dark secret that the CIA want kept buried. In a race against time, and as the body count piles up, the indications that the establishment are behind the horror becomes more and more apparent.\r\nIn part one of a seven story adventure, which moves in real time over six traumatic months, the moral question is set. Should good people do bad things to protect others.\r\nWould you?\r\nThe Newsmaker introduces Ryan Ward, efficient, ruthless killer and lonely, vulnerable man. Ward kills like a warrior without fear, and protects the weak like a mother protecting a new-born. His personal mission is to tear down the establishment and hold all of those who thought they were untouchable to account for their actions, and end their control. Definitively.\r\n\r\nEnjoy and please SEED!!!","last_updated":"2017-09-03T12:03:44.771Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:20241dbf491d80ffcbe9ac30dcf773ccaf1545e1","dn":"The Newsmaker - Tom Field [EN EPUB] [ebook] [ps]","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"20241dbf491d80ffcbe9ac30dcf773ccaf1545e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,36,29,191,73,29,128,255,203,233,172,48,220,247,115,204,175,21,69,225]},"name":"The Newsmaker - Tom Field [EN EPUB] [ebook] [ps]","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
