Even though you still can watch the match, you certainly lose interest in the game without sound. If this is so, then think of a time when the whole world will fall into a mute mode. No! No one can even contemplate a soundless world.\r\nThe world we live in is full of sound. The chirping of birds, whistling of wind, roaring of animals, splashing of water-these are all part of the rhythms of nature. Not only natural sounds, but man-made sounds like the honking of horns too become an inevitable part of our lives. In short, Man and sound are inseparable.\r\nThis issue of Tell Me Why, gives you a glimpse into the magical world of sound.\r\n <a href=\"\nhttps://s22.postimg.org/4ei6bclu9/Story_of_Sound.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://s22.postimg.org/4ei6bclu9/Story_of_Sound.jpg</a>","last_updated":"2017-06-08T12:00:26.167Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b1410198457907e9181b951271bd58930532213","dn":"Story of Sound (Tell Me Why #129)(gnv64)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"5b1410198457907e9181b951271bd58930532213","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,20,16,25,132,87,144,126,145,129,185,81,39,27,213,137,48,83,34,19]},"name":"Story of Sound (Tell Me Why #129)(gnv64)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
