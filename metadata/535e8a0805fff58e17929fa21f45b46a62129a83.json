They have shared everything, including their desire to escape the stifling limitations of their birthplace, the quiet town of Royston, Massachusetts. But as the two girls enter adolescence, their paths diverge and Cassie sets out on a journey that will put her life in danger and shatter her oldest friendship.\r\n\r\nClaire Messud, one of our finest novelists, is as accomplished at weaving a compelling fictional world as she is at asking the big questions: To what extent can we know ourselves and others? What are the stories we create to comprehend our lives and relationships? Brilliantly mixing fable and coming-of-age tale, The Burning Girl gets to the heart of these matters in an absolutely irresistible way.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-08-31T12:00:36.490Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:535e8a0805fff58e17929fa21f45b46a62129a83","dn":"The Burning Girl by Claire Messud ePUB eBOOK-ZAK","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"535e8a0805fff58e17929fa21f45b46a62129a83","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,94,138,8,5,255,245,142,23,146,159,162,31,69,180,106,98,18,154,131]},"name":"The Burning Girl by Claire Messud ePUB eBOOK-ZAK","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
