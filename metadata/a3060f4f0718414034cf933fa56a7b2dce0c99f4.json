Led by Emmitt Smith, the charismatic Deion &quot;Prime Time&quot; Sanders, and Hall of Famers Troy Aikman and Michael Irvin, the Cowboys rank among the greatest of all NFL dynasties.\r\n\r\nIn similar fashion to his New York Times best seller The Bad Guys Won!, award-winning writer Jeff Pearlman chronicles the outrageous antics and dazzling talent of a team fueled by ego, sex, drugs -and unrivaled greatness. Rising from the ashes of a 1 - 15 season in 1989 to capture three Super Bowl trophies in four years, the Dallas Cowboys were guided by a swashbuckling, skirt-chasing, power-hungry owner, Jerry Jones, and his two eccentric, hard-living coaches, Jimmy Johnson and Barry Switzer. Together the three built a juggernaut that America loved and loathed. But for a team that was so dominant on Sundays, the Cowboys were often a dysfunctional circus the rest of the week.\r\n\r\nIrvin, nicknamed &quot;The Playmaker,&quot; battled dual addictions to drugs and women. Charles Haley, the defensive colossus, presided over the team&apos;s infamous &quot;White House,&quot; where the parties lasted late into the night and a steady stream of long-legged groupies came and went. And then there were Smith and Sanders, whose Texas-sized egos were eclipsed only by their record-breaking on-field performances.\r\n\r\nWith an unforgettable cast of characters and a narrative as hard-hitting and fast-paced as the team itself, Boys Will Be Boys immortalizes the most beloved - and despised - dynasty in NFL history.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-07-13T12:06:04.034Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:a3060f4f0718414034cf933fa56a7b2dce0c99f4","dn":"Boys Will Be Boys by Jeff Pearlman EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"a3060f4f0718414034cf933fa56a7b2dce0c99f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,6,15,79,7,24,65,64,52,207,147,63,165,106,123,45,206,12,153,244]},"name":"Boys Will Be Boys by Jeff Pearlman EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
