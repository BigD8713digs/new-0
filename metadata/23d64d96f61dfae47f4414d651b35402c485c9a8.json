It is host to feature articles longer than those typically in the newspaper and has attracted many notable contributors. The magazine is also noted for its photography, especially relating to fashion and style.\r\nIts first issue was published on September 6, 1896, and contained the first photographs ever printed in the newspaper.[3] In the early decades it was a section of the broadsheet paper and not an insert as it is today. The creation of a &quot;serious&quot; Sunday magazine was part of a massive overhaul of the newspaper instigated that year by its new owner, Adolph Ochs, who also banned fiction, comic strips and gossip columns from the paper, and is generally credited with saving The New York Times from financial ruin.[4] In 1897, the magazine published a 16-page spread of photographs documenting Queen Victoria&apos;s Diamond Jubilee, a &quot;costly feat&quot; that resulted in a wildly popular issue and helped boost the magazine to success","last_updated":"2017-06-21T12:00:55.877Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:23d64d96f61dfae47f4414d651b35402c485c9a8","dn":"The New York Times Magazine June 18 2017 - True PDF - zeke23","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"23d64d96f61dfae47f4414d651b35402c485c9a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,214,77,150,246,29,250,228,127,68,20,214,81,179,84,2,196,133,201,168]},"name":"The New York Times Magazine June 18 2017 - True PDF - zeke23","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
