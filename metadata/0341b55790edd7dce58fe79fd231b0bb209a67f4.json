The physical aspects of your design space, such as furniture positioning, design elements, sustainability, wellness, and organization, are representative of your relationship with your body. And finally, the spirit refers to all the invisible energies within you and your home&#x2014;feng shui, atmosphere, and the soul of your home.\r\n\r\nYears ago, author and holistic feng shui expert Laura Benko was diagnosed with a rare cancer. Around that time, a book serendipitously fell on her head. She took this as a much-needed sign to devote the next decade of her life to research and hundreds of transformative holistic design consultations. Her clients&#x2019; real-life, inspiring stories, along with specific actions and tips, have become the foundation for The Holistic Home. \r\n\r\nChapter by chapter, you&#x2019;ll learn how to holistically tackle it all&#x2014;relationships, clutter, health, communities, inner balance, and more&#x2014;by looking within your immediate environment to make direct connections in your life","last_updated":"2018-01-28T12:03:36.091Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:0341b55790edd7dce58fe79fd231b0bb209a67f4","dn":"The Holistic Home - Feng Shui for Mind, Body, Spirit, Space by L","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"0341b55790edd7dce58fe79fd231b0bb209a67f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,65,181,87,144,237,215,220,229,143,231,159,210,49,176,187,32,154,103,244]},"name":"The Holistic Home - Feng Shui for Mind, Body, Spirit, Space by L","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
