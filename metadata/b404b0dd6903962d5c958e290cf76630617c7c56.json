Evelyn is breaking up with her boyfriend, who&#x2019;s passing out advertisements for his band on a snowy street corner in Baltimore. She&apos;s seen their dismal future together at Dr. Chin&apos;s office: she and her boyfriend, both many years older, singing &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; to a Chihuahua and arguing about cheese. She hopes for more. Meanwhile, Godfrey is proposing to his girlfriend, Madge, who is not quite willing to take that leap; she wants to see their future together first - just to be sure they&apos;re meant for each other.\r\n\r\nThe Future for Curious People follows Evelyn and Godfrey&apos;s soon-to-be-entwined lives, set in motion by the fabulist premise of a world with envisionists like Dr. Chin. In struggling with their pasts and possible futures, the characters encounter the mysteries of sorrow, love, death, and fate. It&#x2019;s a story that will capture you with its brightness, its hopefulness, its anxious twists and turns. It is a love story that is ultimately a statement about happiness and how to accept our fleeting existence.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-09-13T12:03:32.902Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:b404b0dd6903962d5c958e290cf76630617c7c56","dn":"Future for Curious People by Gregory Sherl EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"b404b0dd6903962d5c958e290cf76630617c7c56","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,4,176,221,105,3,150,45,92,149,142,41,12,247,102,48,97,124,124,86]},"name":"Future for Curious People by Gregory Sherl EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
