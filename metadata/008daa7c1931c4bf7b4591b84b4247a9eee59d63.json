Ray shows how to wring water from these barren lands and how travelling light is the key to success on such an epic journey.\r\n\r\nE02 The Bushtucker Man (720p)\r\nRay Mears makes a journey across Queensland with bushtucker man Les Hiddins. They both share a love of the wilderness and have learnt much of what they know from indigenous people. Each of them has already left his mark on the world of bushcraft and now they get to work together for the first time.\r\n\r\nE03 The Torres Strait (720p)\r\nRay Mears travels to the Torres Strait Islands to learn how the islanders&apos; lifestyle has helped them retain much of their bushcraft and knowledge. He finds out how these skills helped people survive during the Second World War and tells the story of Barbara Thompson, a young woman who was shipwrecked in the mid-19th century and survived despite the islands&apos; reputation for cannibalism at the time.\r\n\r\nE04 Rock Art (720p/50fps)\r\nRock art is incredibly important to the Australian Aboriginal way of life and the Kimberley area in north Western Australia is full of it. Ray travels with an Aboriginal artist to learn more about the significance of the art of the area and even has a go at painting in the Aboriginal style himself.\r\n\r\n[i]Note: this episode is at 50fps quality and hence twice the size of the former three, which are at 25fps quality. 25fps download was not available for this program[/i]\r\n\r\n(with soft subtitles) \r\n\r\nFirst broadcast: May-June 2008\r\nDuration:  1 hour per episode","last_updated":"2017-05-31T12:08:25.375Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:008daa7c1931c4bf7b4591b84b4247a9eee59d63","dn":"Ray Mears Goes Walkabout","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"008daa7c1931c4bf7b4591b84b4247a9eee59d63","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,141,170,124,25,49,196,191,123,69,145,184,75,66,71,169,238,229,157,99]},"name":"Ray Mears Goes Walkabout","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
