Milton EPUB\r\n\r\nSix gentlemen, one goal: the destruction of Hitler&apos;s war machine\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1939, a top-secret organization was founded in London: Its purpose was to plot the destruction of Hitler&apos;s war machine through spectacular acts of sabotage.\r\n\r\nThe guerrilla campaign that followed was every bit as extraordinary as the six men who directed it. One of them, Cecil Clarke, was a maverick engineer who had spent the 1930s inventing futuristic caravans. Now his talents were put to more devious use: He built the dirty bomb used to assassinate Hitler&apos;s favorite, Reinhard Heydrich. Another, William Fairbairn, was a portly pensioner with an unusual passion: He was the world&apos;s leading expert in silent killing, hired to train the guerrillas being parachuted behind enemy lines. Led by dapper Scotsman Colin Gubbins, these men - along with three others - formed a secret inner circle that, aided by a group of formidable ladies, single-handedly changed the course of the Second World War: a cohort handpicked by Winston Churchill whom he called his Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare.\r\n\r\nChurchill&apos;s Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare is a gripping and vivid narrative of adventure and derring-do that is also, perhaps, the last great untold story of the Second World War.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-11-25T13:53:18.319Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca2efbf9480fa136a7eed3802c075cc7241cb978","dn":"Churchill's Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare by G.
