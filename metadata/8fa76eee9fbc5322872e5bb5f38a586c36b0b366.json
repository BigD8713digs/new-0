For Neo-Impressionists Paul Signac and Henri Edmund Cross the region provided a vision of utopia, while for Henri Matisse the vivid colours of the area inspired him to adopt a new palette and in doing so set modern art en route to abstraction.  \r\n\r\nWith visits to L&apos;Estaque, St Tropez and Nice, Grant maps the progress of the region from cultural backwater to bohemian hotspot.\r\n\r\n\r\nE02 The Golden Era\r\nRichard E Grant explores how modern art and the Riviera grew up together when France&apos;s Cote D&apos;Azur became the hedonistic playground and experimental studio for the great masters of 20th-century painting. With Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso resident on the coast, other artists from Jean Cocteau to Henri Lartigue, Raoul Dufy to Fernand Leger and Francis Picabia to Sergei Diaghilev were drawn to the area.  \r\n\r\nAs transatlantic liners brought America&apos;s super-rich to the region, art and celebrity became integrally intertwined as cultural gurus and multimillionaires all partied on the beach. In an era of sunshine and bathing, of cinema and fast cars, of the Ballet Russes and Monte Carlo casinos, Grant discovers the extraordinary output of what became briefly the world&apos;s creative hub.\r\n\r\n(with soft subtitles) \r\n\r\nFirst broadcast: January 2013\r\nDuration:  1 hour per show","last_updated":"2017-06-14T12:05:04.611Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:8fa76eee9fbc5322872e5bb5f38a586c36b0b366","dn":"The Riviera - A History in Pictures","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"8fa76eee9fbc5322872e5bb5f38a586c36b0b366","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,167,110,238,159,188,83,34,135,46,91,181,243,138,88,108,54,176,179,102]},"name":"The Riviera - A History in Pictures","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
