Her dad left. Boys at school can&#x2019;t keep their hands to themselves. A lecherous stepfather has moved in. Her only refuge is an abandoned lot on her suburban cul-de-sac, crawling with feral felines - one of which follows Mia home. Ghostly white and affectionate, she is Mia&#x2019;s new companion and - as Mia&#x2019;s tormenters will soon discover - her fierce protector.\r\n\r\nJoyce Carol Oates&#x2019;s Miao Dao is part of Dark Corners, a collection of seven heart-stopping short stories by bestselling authors who give you so many new reasons to be afraid. Each story can be read in a single sitting. Or, if you have the nerve, you can read all by yourself in the dark.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-10-06T12:02:05.918Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f86a7b033d78bdb10ea4ce0eaf3ffbab57383b2","dn":"Miao Dao by Joyce Carol Oates EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"0f86a7b033d78bdb10ea4ce0eaf3ffbab57383b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,134,167,176,51,215,139,219,16,234,76,224,234,243,255,186,181,115,131,178]},"name":"Miao Dao by Joyce Carol Oates EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
