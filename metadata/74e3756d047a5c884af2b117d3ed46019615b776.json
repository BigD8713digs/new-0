The album was mixed in a retro 70s fashion by Lennart &#xD6;stlund, who has previously worked with bands like ABBA and Led Zeppelin, at Polar Studios","last_updated":"2017-07-11T12:05:04.378Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:74e3756d047a5c884af2b117d3ed46019615b776","dn":"Luciferian Light Orchestra (self titled album) 320kbps","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"74e3756d047a5c884af2b117d3ed46019615b776","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,227,117,109,4,122,92,136,74,242,177,23,211,237,70,1,150,21,183,118]},"name":"Luciferian Light Orchestra (self titled album) 320kbps","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
