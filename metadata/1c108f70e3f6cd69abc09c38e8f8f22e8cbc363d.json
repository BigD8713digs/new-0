Welcome to Hope County, Montana. This picturesque nook has become home to people who truly value freedom ... and also for a sect of religious fanatics called The Gate of Eden Project. The sect is led by Joseph Sid, who considers himself a prophet, along with his brothers and sister - the so-called Messengers. The sect tries to regulate all aspects of life of the inhabitants of the district, where once the peace and tranquility prevailed. Arriving in Montana, your hero sees that representatives of the Gate of Eden are preparing to establish full control over the region. You have to unite the people of the district and awaken their will to fight for freedom. You will be able to explore the expanses of Hope County, including rivers and airspace, using a variety of types of modified weapons and transport - such a diverse range of equipment in Far Cry has not yet been! You will find yourself in the middle of an exciting history in an unpredictable world that reacts to all your actions. Each new place you visit and the people you meet will have a significant impact on the development of events. Many surprises await you!\r\n\r\nHow to install : \r\n\r\nMount the iso\r\nInstall the game\r\nPlay","last_updated":"2018-04-16T15:25:44.244Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c108f70e3f6cd69abc09c38e8f8f22e8cbc363d","dn":"Far Cry 5 Gold Edition   DLCs   Season Pass","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"1c108f70e3f6cd69abc09c38e8f8f22e8cbc363d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,16,143,112,227,246,205,105,171,192,156,56,232,248,242,46,140,188,54,61]},"name":"Far Cry 5 Gold Edition   DLCs   Season Pass","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
