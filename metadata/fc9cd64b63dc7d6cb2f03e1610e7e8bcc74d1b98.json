Separated from her father and forced onto a crowded train, Lina, her mother, and her young brother make their way to a Siberian work camp, where they are forced to fight for their lives. Lina finds solace in her art, documenting these events by drawing. Risking everything, she imbeds clues in her drawings of their location and secretly passes them along, hoping her drawings will make their way to her father&apos;s prison camp. But will strength, love, and hope be enough for Lina and her family to survive?","last_updated":"2018-03-20T12:03:35.792Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc9cd64b63dc7d6cb2f03e1610e7e8bcc74d1b98","dn":"Between Shades of Gray","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"fc9cd64b63dc7d6cb2f03e1610e7e8bcc74d1b98","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,156,214,75,99,220,125,108,178,240,62,22,16,231,232,188,199,77,27,152]},"name":"Between Shades of Gray","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
