Relieved, but still terrified, they sit by the hospital bedside of their fifteen-year-old daughter, Lana, who was found bloodied, bruised, and disoriented after going missing for four days during a mother-daughter vacation in the country. As Lana lies mute in the bed, unwilling or unable to articulate what happened to her during that period, the national media speculates wildly and Jen and Hugh try to answer many questions. \r\n\r\nWhere was Lana? How did she get hurt? Was the teenage boy who befriended her involved? How did she survive outside for all those days? Even when she returns to the family home and her school routine, Lana only provides the same frustrating answer over and over: &quot;I can&apos;t remember.&quot; For years, Jen had tried to soothe the depressive demons plaguing her younger child, and had always dreaded the worst. Now she has hope&#x2014;the family has gone through hell and come out the other side. But Jen cannot let go of her need to find the truth. Without telling Hugh or their pregnan older daughter Meg, Jen sets off to retrace Lana&apos;s steps, a journey that will lead her to a deeper understanding of her youngest daughter, her family, and herself.\r\n\r\nGenre: Fiction &gt; General Fiction/Classics","last_updated":"2018-10-27T12:48:15.577Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:92a66b69ec603c2a0da96dfaff50b7758d733d2a","dn":"Whistle in the Dark by Emma Healey (.epub)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"92a66b69ec603c2a0da96dfaff50b7758d733d2a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,166,107,105,236,96,60,42,13,169,109,250,255,80,183,117,141,115,61,42]},"name":"Whistle in the Dark by Emma Healey (.epub)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
