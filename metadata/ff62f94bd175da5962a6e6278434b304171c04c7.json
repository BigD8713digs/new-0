But in middle age, he discovered the new anxieties and pleasures of mastering a new culture. When he left 15 years later to take a teaching position in the U.S., he was fluent enough to broadcast on French radio and TV, and in his work as a journalist, he&#x2019;d made the acquaintance of everyone from Yves Saint Laurent to Catherine Deneuve to Michel Foucault. He&#x2019;d also developed a close friendship with an older woman, Marie-Claude, through which he&#x2019;d come to understand French life and culture in a deeper way. The book&#x2019;s title evokes the Parisian landscape in the eternal mists and the half-light, the serenity of the city compared to the New York White had known (and vividly recalled in City Boy). White fell headily in love with the city and its culture: both intoxicated and intellectually stimulated. He became the definitive biographer of Jean Genet; he wrote lives of Marcel Proust and Arthur Rimbaud; and he became a recipient of the French Order of Arts and Letters. Inside a Pearl recalls those fertile years for White. It&#x2019;s a memoir which gossips and ruminates, and offers a brilliant examination of a city and a culture eternally imbued with an aura of enchantment.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-09-04T12:00:33.471Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff62f94bd175da5962a6e6278434b304171c04c7","dn":"Inside a Pearl_ My Years in Paris by Edmund White ePUB eBOOK-ZAK","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"ff62f94bd175da5962a6e6278434b304171c04c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,98,249,75,209,117,218,89,98,166,230,39,132,52,179,4,23,28,4,199]},"name":"Inside a Pearl_ My Years in Paris by Edmund White ePUB eBOOK-ZAK","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
