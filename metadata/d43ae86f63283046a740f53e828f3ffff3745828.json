This book is about the why behind Islamic terrorism.\r\n\r\nTerrorists have written many books and pamphlets explaining their position, but most westerners are unable to understand them. Dr. Mark Gabriel makes a major breakthrough by identifying the five pillars of radical philosophy- the bedrock beliefs that cut through all radical writings. Dr. Gabriel uses the writings of Osama bin Laden, Ayman al-Zawahiri, and others to show how terrorists justify their actions through the Quran, the life of Muhammad and Islamic history. Finally, Dr. Gabriel describes how earlier terrorist groups were stopped and shows how the world can work together to stop the terrorists of today.\r\n\r\nIgnorance is no ally in the struggle against Islamic terrorism.\r\n\r\nGo beyond what is happening and find out why it is happening. The struggle against terrorism may seem to be at a stalemate, but there is hope for the future.\r\n\r\nPlease seed.  Thanks!","last_updated":"2017-09-16T12:14:38.185Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:d43ae86f63283046a740f53e828f3ffff3745828","dn":" Inside The Mind Of an Islamic Terrorist - Mark A Gabriel  epub/","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"d43ae86f63283046a740f53e828f3ffff3745828","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,58,232,111,99,40,48,70,167,64,245,62,130,143,63,255,243,116,88,40]},"name":" Inside The Mind Of an Islamic Terrorist - Mark A Gabriel  epub/","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
