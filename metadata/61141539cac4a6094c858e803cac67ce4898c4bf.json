Johnstone, J.A. Johnstone\r\n\r\nPurgatory, Arizona, is the last place you&apos;ll ever cross the law. Because in this town, the law is the personal fiefdom of an evil man--as Matt Jensen discovered on his first day in town, when an unavoidable gunfight and a dead deputy landed him in jail, sentenced to hang at Yuma Prison.\r\n\r\nBut when the train from Purgatory to Yuma is violently derailed, Matt is set free amidst the carnage--with a choice to make. He can run for his life and live like an outlaw or take a chance with the determined U.S. Marshall who must hunt him down. For Matt, the choice will be easy. Because when both he and his pursuer tangle with a vicious band of outlaws, they&apos;re both caught on the same bloody trail. . .that leads straight back to Purgatory","last_updated":"2017-06-11T12:01:10.328Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:61141539cac4a6094c858e803cac67ce4898c4bf","dn":"William Johnstone -Purgatory-The Last Mountain Man #3","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"61141539cac4a6094c858e803cac67ce4898c4bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,20,21,57,202,196,166,9,76,133,142,128,60,172,103,206,72,152,196,191]},"name":"William Johnstone -Purgatory-The Last Mountain Man #3","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
