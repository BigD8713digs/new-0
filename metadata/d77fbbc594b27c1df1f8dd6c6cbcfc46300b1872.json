This book presents the theory and practice for creating effective education and outreach programmes for conservation. The authors describe an exciting array of techniques for enhancing school resources, marketing environmental messages, using social media, developing partnerships for conservation, and designing on-site programmes for parks and community centres. Vivid case studies from around the world illustrate techniques and describe planning, implementation, and evaluation procedures, enabling readers to implement their own new ideas effectively. \r\n\r\n---\r\n <a href=\"\nhttp://dlfeb.com/book/conservation-education-and-outreach-techniques-techniques-in-ecology-conservation/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttp://dlfeb.com/book/conservation-education-and-outreach-techniques-techniques-in-ecology-conservation/</a>","last_updated":"2017-07-23T12:01:31.259Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:d77fbbc594b27c1df1f8dd6c6cbcfc46300b1872","dn":"CONSERVATION EDUCATION AND OUTREACH TECHNIQUES ","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"d77fbbc594b27c1df1f8dd6c6cbcfc46300b1872","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,127,187,197,148,178,124,29,241,248,221,108,108,188,252,70,48,11,24,114]},"name":"CONSERVATION EDUCATION AND OUTREACH TECHNIQUES ","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
