Arthur, an old widower struggling to overcome his grief, meets Maddy, a troubled teenage girl who avoids school by hiding out where Arthur goes every day for lunch. The two strike up a friendship that draws them out of isolation. Maddy gives Arthur the name Truluv for his positive responses to every outrageous thing she says or does. When Arthur&apos;s nosy neighbor Lucille horns in on their friendship, they create an unconventional family, sometimes bickering but most often believing that life&apos;s most precious moments are sweeter when shared.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-11-23T12:04:02.354Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:4a9ae98c6c0ded0fd64270d7a7b39ba7a2ca4090","dn":"The Story of Arthur Truluv by Elizabeth Berg EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"4a9ae98c6c0ded0fd64270d7a7b39ba7a2ca4090","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,154,233,140,108,13,237,15,214,66,112,215,167,179,155,167,162,202,64,144]},"name":"The Story of Arthur Truluv by Elizabeth Berg EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
