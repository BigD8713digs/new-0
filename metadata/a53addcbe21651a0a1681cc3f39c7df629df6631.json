Charting the course of an uncertain life - and feeling guilt from her husband&apos;s tragic death - Merritt travels from her home in Maine to Beaufort, where the secrets of Cal&apos;s unspoken-of past reside among the pluff mud and jasmine of the ancestral Heyward home on the Bluff. This unknown legacy, now Merritt&apos;s, will change and define her as she navigates her new life - a new life complicated by the arrival of her too-young stepmother and 10-year-old half brother.\r\n\r\nSoon, in this house of strangers, Merritt is forced into unraveling the Heyward family past as she faces her own fears and finds the healing she needs in the salt air of the Low Country.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-06-13T12:06:09.364Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:a53addcbe21651a0a1681cc3f39c7df629df6631","dn":"The Sound of Glass by Karen White EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"a53addcbe21651a0a1681cc3f39c7df629df6631","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,58,221,203,226,22,81,160,161,104,28,195,243,156,125,246,41,223,102,49]},"name":"The Sound of Glass by Karen White EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
