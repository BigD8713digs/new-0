That goes for all of our weather, it is all molested by man in one manner or another. This storm was completely full of and surrounded by aerosols left by planes and ships from the start. As acknowledged by the American Meteorological Society; &quot;Aerosols act mostly as cloud-drop condensation nuclei (CCN), and some of them as ice nuclei (IN), both of which change cloud radiative and precipitation properties in complex ways.&quot;\r\n\r\n&quot;In warm moist atmospheres, aerosols often invigorate deep convective clouds, usually resulting in greater electrical activity, stronger damaging winds, and a greater likelihood of flash floods. Studies indicate that aerosols might also modulate the intensity of tornadoes and hurricanes.&quot; &apos;Inadvertent Weather Modification&apos;\r\n\r\nPlease share this information far and wide, burn the video to DVDs/Blu-ray discs or put it on USB Flash Drives and give them out to friends, family and others.\r\n\r\nPlease seed as long as possible, at least to a ratio of 1.100, thank you :)\r\n\r\nGeneral           : Climate Engineering Report (Review of Hurricane Michael) 720p.mp4\r\nFormat            : MPEG-4 at 894 kb/s\r\nLength            : 194 MiB for 30 min 23 s 719 ms\r\n\r\nVideo #0          : AVC at 758 kb/s\r\nAspect            : 1270 x 720 (1.764) at 30.000 fps\r\n\r\nAudio #0          : AAC at 128 kb/s\r\nInfos             : 2 channels, 44.1 kHz\r\n\r\nScreens: <a href=\"\nhttps://extraimage.net/images/2018/10/18/917bf9805230f79ef447f9590c35f2db.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://extraimage.net/images/2018/10/18/917bf9805230f79ef447f9590c35f2db.png</a> <a href=\"\nhttps://extraimage.net/images/2018/10/18/4428e76174c8a22b37098c02b810731c.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://extraimage.net/images/2018/10/18/4428e76174c8a22b37098c02b810731c.png</a> <a href=\"\nhttps://extraimage.net/images/2018/10/18/b8bbb98c0c0ef12d9346d67213817731.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://extraimage.net/images/2018/10/18/b8bbb98c0c0ef12d9346d67213817731.png</a> <a href=\"\nhttps://extraimage.net/images/2018/10/18/c2390f9d890876c2d1654435f1088571.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://extraimage.net/images/2018/10/18/c2390f9d890876c2d1654435f1088571.png</a> <a href=\"\nhttps://extraimage.net/images/2018/10/18/294e6153d8daf03700932db85cd756b6.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://extraimage.net/images/2018/10/18/294e6153d8daf03700932db85cd756b6.png</a> <a href=\"\nhttps://extraimage.net/images/2018/10/18/fca04880b9bb7b8eebed1e17071547d9.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://extraimage.net/images/2018/10/18/fca04880b9bb7b8eebed1e17071547d9.png</a>","last_updated":"2018-10-18T12:42:47.766Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:d229c8a587fffe9c0cd7f1c48662b94a81edebcd","dn":"Climate Engineering Report (Review of Hurricane Michael) 720p","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"d229c8a587fffe9c0cd7f1c48662b94a81edebcd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,41,200,165,135,255,254,156,12,215,241,196,134,98,185,74,129,237,235,205]},"name":"Climate Engineering Report (Review of Hurricane Michael) 720p","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
