Green EPUB\r\n\r\nWhen family secrets are unearthed, a woman&apos;s past can become a dangerous place to hide....\r\n\r\nAfter the death of her adoptive mother, Ava Saunders comes upon a peculiar photograph, sealed and hidden away in a crawl space. The photo shows a shuttered, ramshackle house on top of a steep hill. On the back, a puzzling inscription: Destiny calls us.\r\n\r\nAva is certain that it&apos;s a clue to her elusive past. Twenty-three years ago, she&apos;d been found wrapped in a yellow blanket in the narthex of the Holy Saviour Catholic Church - and rescued - or so she&apos;d been told. Her mother claimed there was no more to the story, so the questions of her abandonment were left unanswered. For Ava, now is the time to find the roots of her mother&apos;s lies. It begins with the house itself - once the scene of a brutal double murder.\r\n\r\nWhen Ava enlists the help of the two people closest to her, a police detective and her best friend, she fears that investigating her past could be a fatal mistake. Someone is following them there. And what&apos;s been buried in Ava&apos;s nightmares isn&apos;t just a crime. It&apos;s a holy conspiracy.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-02-08T12:07:07.184Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:e306f5766ab2570c756b60418067c8629bfb69e4","dn":"Twist of Faith by Ellen J.
