The basis for the 2018 film The Post, The Pentagon Papers are a series of articles, documents, and studies examining the Johnson Administration&apos;s lies to the public about the extent of US involvement in the Vietnam War, bringing to light shocking conclusions about America&apos;s true role in the conflict.\r\n\r\nPublished by The New York Times in 1971, The Pentagon Papers riveted an already deeply divided nation with startling and disturbing revelations about the United States&apos; involvement in Vietnam. The Washington Post called them &quot;the most significant leaks of classified material in American history&quot; and they remain relevant today as a reminder of the importance of a free press and First Amendment rights. The Pentagon Papers demonstrated that the government had systematically lied to both the public and to Congress.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-09-02T12:02:51.241Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ff94123ceae1300ee95eccc26177854eb785de9","dn":"The Pentagon Papers by Neil Sheehan &amp; More EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"0ff94123ceae1300ee95eccc26177854eb785de9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,249,65,35,206,174,19,0,238,149,236,204,38,23,120,84,235,120,93,233]},"name":"The Pentagon Papers by Neil Sheehan &amp; More EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
