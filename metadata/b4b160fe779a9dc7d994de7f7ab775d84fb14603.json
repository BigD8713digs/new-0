The game takes inspiration from fast-paced top-down rogue-lites like Binding of Isaac and Nuclear Throne, and adds free-form, experimentation-driven, emergent gameplay elements of RPGs like Deus Ex.Rather than taking place in a dungeon, the game is set in a functioning, procedurally generated city, where complex AI informs denizens from all walks of life, who are just trying to get by in their daily activities.In","last_updated":"2017-08-12T12:05:01.144Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:b4b160fe779a9dc7d994de7f7ab775d84fb14603","dn":"Streets of Rogue Alpha 31c","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"b4b160fe779a9dc7d994de7f7ab775d84fb14603","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,177,96,254,119,154,157,199,217,148,222,127,122,183,117,216,79,177,70,3]},"name":"Streets of Rogue Alpha 31c","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
