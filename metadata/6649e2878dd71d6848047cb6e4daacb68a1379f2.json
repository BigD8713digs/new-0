Through a series of practical recipes, you&apos;ll learn how to solve specific problems while diving into as much or as little theory as you&apos;re comfortable with.\r\n\r\nAuthor Simon Monk (Raspberry Pi Cookbook) breaks down this complex subject into several topics, from using the right transistor to building and testing projects and prototypes. With this book, you can quickly search electronics topics and go straight to the recipe you need. It also serves as an ideal reference for experienced electronics makers.\r\n\r\nThis cookbook includes:\r\nTheoretical concepts such as Ohm&apos;s law and the relationship between power, voltage, and current\r\nThe fundamental use of resistors, capacitors and inductors, diodes, transistors and integrated circuits, and switches and relays\r\nRecipes on power, sensors and motors, integrated circuits, and radio frequency for designing electronic circuits and devices\r\nAdvice on using Arduino and Raspberry Pi in electronics projects\r\nHow to build and use tools, including multimeters, oscilloscopes, simulations software, and unsoldered prototypes","last_updated":"2017-07-17T12:01:09.902Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:6649e2878dd71d6848047cb6e4daacb68a1379f2","dn":"Electronics Cookbook Practical Electronic Recipes with Arduino a","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"6649e2878dd71d6848047cb6e4daacb68a1379f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,73,226,135,141,215,29,104,72,4,124,182,228,218,172,182,138,19,121,242]},"name":"Electronics Cookbook Practical Electronic Recipes with Arduino a","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
