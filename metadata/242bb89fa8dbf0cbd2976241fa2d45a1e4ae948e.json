Targeted at server, desktop and embedded use, it is now the only professional quality virtualization solution that is also Open Source Software. VirtualBox is a powerful virtualization product for enterprise as well as home use. VirtualBox provides are useful for several scenarios: Running multiple operating systems simultaneously. VirtualBox allows you to run more than one operating system at a time. This way, you can run software written for one operating system on another (for example, Windows software on Linux or a Mac) without having to reboot to use it.\t\r\n\r\nSince you can con&#xFB01;gure what kinds of &#x201C;virtual&#x201D; hardware should be presented to each such operating system, you can install an old operating system such as DOS or OS/2 even if your real computer&#x2019;s hardware is no longer supported by that operating system.\r\nSoftware vendors can use virtual machines to ship entire software con&#xFB01;gurations. For example, installing a complete mail server solution on a real machine can be a tedious task. With VirtualBox, such a complex setup (then often called an &#x201C;appliance&#x201D;) can be packed into a virtual machine. Installing and running a mail server becomes as easy as importing such an appliance into VirtualBox.\r\n\r\nTesting and disaster recovery. Once installed, a virtual machine and its virtual hard disks can be considered a &#x201C;container&#x201D; that can be arbitrarily frozen, woken up, copied, backed up, and transported betweenOn top of that, with the use of another VirtualBox feature called &#x201C;snapshots&#x201D;, one can save a particular state of a virtual machine and revert back to that state, if necessary. This way, one can freely experiment with a computing environment. If something goes wrong (e.g. after installing misbehaving software or infecting the guest with a virus), one can easily switch back to a previous snapshot and avoid the need of frequent backups and restores. Any number of snapshots can be created, allowing you to travel back and forward in virtual machine time. You can delete snapshots while a VM is running to reclaim disk space.\r\nInfrastructure consolidation. Virtualization can signi&#xFB01;cantly reduce hardware and electricity costs. Most of the time, computers today only use a fraction of their potential power and run with low average system loads. A lot of hardware resources as well as electricity is thereby wasted. So, instead of running many such physical computers that are only partially used, one can pack many virtual machines onto a few powerfuland balance the loads between them","last_updated":"2017-12-20T12:08:42.974Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:242bb89fa8dbf0cbd2976241fa2d45a1e4ae948e","dn":"VirtualBox 5.2.4 Build 119785.Full","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"242bb89fa8dbf0cbd2976241fa2d45a1e4ae948e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,43,184,159,168,219,240,203,210,151,98,65,250,45,69,161,228,174,148,142]},"name":"VirtualBox 5.2.4 Build 119785.Full","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
