Shankar(2014) - EPUB - zeke23\r\nPublication Date: 2014-03-25 - ISBN-13: 9780300192209 - 441 Pages - EPUB - English\r\nProfessor R. Shankar, a well-known physicist and contagiously enthusiastic educator, was among the first to offer a course through the innovative Open Yale Course program. His popular online video lectures on introductory physics have been viewed over a million times. In this concise and self-contained book based on his online Yale course, Shankar explains the fundamental concepts of physics from Galileo&#x2019;s and Newton&#x2019;s discoveries to the twentieth-century&#x2019;s revolutionary ideas on relativity and quantum mechanics.\r\n\r\nThe book begins at the simplest level, develops the basics, and reinforces fundamentals, ensuring a solid foundation in the principles and methods of physics. It provides an ideal introduction for college-level students of physics, chemistry, and engineering, for motivated AP Physics students, and for general readers interested in advances in the sciences.\r\n\r\nInstructor resources--including problem sets and sample examinations--and more information about Professor Shankar&apos;s course are available at http://oyc.yale.edu/physics/phys-200.\r\nTable of Contents\r\n\r\nChapter 1.
