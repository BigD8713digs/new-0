It&apos;s the permission you give others - and yourself - to forgive a debt, to absolve the unabsolvable, to let go of the judgment and pain that make life so difficult.\r\n\r\nIn Hallelujah Anyway: Rediscovering Mercy, Lamott ventures to explore where to find meaning in life. We should begin, she suggests, by &quot;facing a great big mess, especially the great big mess of ourselves.&quot; It&apos;s up to each of us to recognize the presence and importance of mercy everywhere - &quot;within us and outside us, all around us&quot; - and to use it to forge a deeper understanding of ourselves and more honest connections with each other. While that can be difficult to do, Lamott argues that it&apos;s crucial, as &quot;kindness towards others, beginning with myself, buys us a shot at a warm and generous heart, the greatest prize of all.&quot;\r\n\r\nFull of Lamott&apos;s trademark honesty, humor, and forthrightness, Hallelujah Anyway is profound and caring, funny and wise - a hopeful book of hands-on spirituality.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-08-17T12:00:24.410Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:f86b34bb0d10a1cafde2b8b5bb4b832f02e14d5a","dn":"Anne Lamott - Hallelujah Anyway 2017 RETAiL ePUB eBOOK-DiSTRiBUT","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"f86b34bb0d10a1cafde2b8b5bb4b832f02e14d5a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,107,52,187,13,16,161,202,253,226,184,181,187,75,131,47,2,225,77,90]},"name":"Anne Lamott - Hallelujah Anyway 2017 RETAiL ePUB eBOOK-DiSTRiBUT","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
