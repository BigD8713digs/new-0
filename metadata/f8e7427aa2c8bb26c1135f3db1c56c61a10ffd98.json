Slug&apos;s lyrics are still generally themed around the struggles of daily existence, but these songs are a bit more preoccupied with mortality and legacy than previous outings. &quot;Graffiti&quot; opens with the ominous words &quot;I wrote this one when I was still alive,&quot; and on &quot;Virgo&quot; he spits &quot;You can sacrifice me to the weather if you promise that you&apos;ll let my songs live forever.&quot; Other songs focus on relationship troubles; Musab&apos;s guest verse on &quot;Earring&quot; compares a dysfunctional marriage to Night of the Living Dead, while the wryly humorous &quot;Trim&quot; is a lament about a couple rarely having time for sex due to family and work obligations. The album&apos;s most plainly optimistic moment is the easily swinging &quot;Mijo,&quot; which offers the encouragement that &quot;It&apos;s never too late to get some heaven on earth.&quot; Musically, the album is an organic blend of live instrumentation and 808 beats, sounding less polished and radio-friendly than the group&apos;s most commercially successful albums, but not as rough as the earlier stuff","last_updated":"2018-10-07T12:42:58.476Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:f8e7427aa2c8bb26c1135f3db1c56c61a10ffd98","dn":"Atmosphere - Mi Vida Local (2018) [24.44 FLAC]","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"f8e7427aa2c8bb26c1135f3db1c56c61a10ffd98","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,231,66,122,162,200,187,38,193,19,95,61,177,197,108,97,161,15,253,152]},"name":"Atmosphere - Mi Vida Local (2018) [24.44 FLAC]","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
