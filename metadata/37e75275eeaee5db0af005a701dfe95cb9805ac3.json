Nonetheless, looking back on it, I lived a childhood with a &#x201C;silver spoon in my mouth&#x201D; &#x2013; brought up in a rambling manor house in the beautiful Devon countryside.\r\nIt&#x2019;s been downhill ever since.\r\nI was a librarian for a long time, a noble profession. Then I started a series called History In An Hour which I sold, along with my soul, to HarperCollins UK.\r\nI now live in London with my wife, two children and dog (a fluffy cockapoo) and write historical fiction, mainly 20th century war and misery.\r\nHistorical fiction with heart.\r\n\r\nBook 1 -The Black Maria\r\n&#x2018;When love becomes your greatest enemy&#x2019;\r\nMaria has a past &#x2013; the sort that, if known, would cost her her freedom. So monstrous her past crime, she is forced to live a lie. Maria marries Petrov, a Party activist, not out of love, but as a means of forming a new identity, to escape her past. Her existence is safe &#x2013; but dull. Until the day she meets Dmitry.\r\n\r\nBook 2 - My Brother the Enemy\r\n&#x2018;Fear on the streets. Death on every corner.
