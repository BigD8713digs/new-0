Resembling the world as he knows it, but unlimited in space and time, it&#x2019;s unlike any eternity he has contemplated. Its residents are those who choose not to reincarnate, which would erase all memory of who they once were. Kip has a quest: to find his beloved Lucy, a yoga teacher who shared his apartment for years but died of leukemia before he took his own life.\r\n\r\nIs she still here? Has she waited for him, or &#x201C;gone back&#x201D; to become someone else?\r\n\r\nIn his odyssey across centuries and locales (Istanbul to the Marquesas Islands, India to Oklahoma and New Guinea) to find her, Kip is guided by Walt Whitman - who urges him to write this memoir on his return.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-06-08T12:14:43.279Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:b4509a4067309ac51a003a5c6585b360fdb1588c","dn":"The Land of Later On by Anthony Weller EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"b4509a4067309ac51a003a5c6585b360fdb1588c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,80,154,64,103,48,154,197,26,0,58,92,101,133,179,96,253,177,88,140]},"name":"The Land of Later On by Anthony Weller EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
