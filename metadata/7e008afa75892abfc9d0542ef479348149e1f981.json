With the new &quot;Technician Application&quot; you will be able to have a portable version of Macrium Reflect to boot directly from USB. \r\n\r\nFEATURES - \r\nWindows PE 10.0 -- based on Windows 10. Supports UEFI / secure boot, USB 3.0, HyperV Gen 2 VMs and Windows overlay file systems. \r\n\r\nThis is the best choice for Win 8, 8.1, 10, Server 2012, 2012R2 systems. Windows PE 10 is a requirement if your system uses Windows 8.1 WIMBoot technology or if your system is a Windows 10 &apos;Compact Install&apos;. Both of these installation types are rare but may be used on Windows Tablet PCs with limited disk space. \r\n\r\nNote: The Windows PE 10.0 download option is not available if you are running Windows XP, Vista or Server 2003/2008 \r\n\r\nIt allows you to easily replace your hard drive or try a new operating system with the certainty that you can still reset your computer to the previous state using the backup file you previously saved. \r\n\r\nIts use also protects your documents, photos, music tracks, and more that you have stored on your computer","last_updated":"2017-06-05T12:01:10.532Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e008afa75892abfc9d0542ef479348149e1f981","dn":"Macrium Reflect Technician's USB 7.0.1998 (WinPE 10.0 x86 x64","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"7e008afa75892abfc9d0542ef479348149e1f981","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,0,138,250,117,137,42,191,201,208,84,46,244,121,52,129,73,225,249,129]},"name":"Macrium Reflect Technician's USB 7.0.1998 (WinPE 10.0 x86 x64","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
