Money and attacks on capitalism (specifically the World Bank) fuel Perry&apos;s ire on this disc, but just when the going gets heavy, Scratch pulls out a tribute to cartoon detective Inspector Gadget, as well as a great cover of Leroy Sibbles&apos; &quot;Party Time.&quot; As with their earlier release, Perry and Sherwood work well together, perhaps due to Sherwood&apos;s fondness for psychedelicizing his dub mixes and Perry&apos;s preference for flat-out weirdness. In any event, this collaboration between pupil and teacher is one of the better releases from this portion of Perry&apos;s long musical journey.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

I think this is an abbreviated version of it though. The album usually has 9 or 11 cuts. This is missing &quot;Inspector Gadget&quot; from the shorter version.\r\n\r\nAnyway, absolutely worth a listen","last_updated":"2018-07-17T12:10:50.699Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a8fbedb6f348842dc59b04bcdb3053606f57e46","dn":"Lee Perry - From The Secret Laboratory","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"9a8fbedb6f348842dc59b04bcdb3053606f57e46","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,143,190,219,111,52,136,66,220,89,176,75,205,179,5,54,6,245,126,70]},"name":"Lee Perry - From The Secret Laboratory","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
