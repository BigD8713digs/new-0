Beginning with Detunized Gravity (1997), Baumgartner and company have explored various forms of lounge music, much of it balancing samples with live instrumentation, with innumerable cross-sections of vintage jazz and soul, easy listening, and Latin music. De-Phazz tracks like &quot;No Jive&quot; and &quot;The Mambo Craze&quot; have appeared on dozens of compilations with &quot;lounge,&quot; &quot;chill,&quot; and &quot;caf&#xE9;&quot; in the title. Though much of the De-Phazz catalog could be termed studio creations, it also contains collaborative, acoustic, and live projects such as Big (recorded with the Radio Bigband Frankfurt, 2009), Naive (2013), and Private (2016). No stranger to outside work, Baumgartner remixed Ella Fitzgerald&apos;s &quot;Wait &apos;til You See Him&quot; for the first Verve Remixed compilation, as well as tracks by the likes of Kool &amp; the Gang, a-ha, and Blank &amp; Jones.\r\n\r\n\r\nAudio Quality:\tPerfect (Lossless)\r\nEncoder:\t\tFLAC\r\nContains: \tAlbum Art, CRC, ID Tag [Vorbis Comments]\r\nGenre: \t\tElectronic\r\nLabel: \t\tUnited Recordings (UTD7001)\r\n\r\n\r\nTracklist:\r\n\r\n01 .The Mambo Craze\r\n02 .Hero Dead &amp; Gone\r\n03 .Jeunesse Dor&#xE9;e\r\n04 .Cut The Jazz\r\n05 .Death By Chocolate\r\n06 .Squeeze The Trigge\r\n07 .Heartfixer\r\n08 .Anchorless\r\n09 .Something Special\r\n10 .Roses\r\n11 .Godsdog\r\n12 .Detunized Gravity\r\n13 .Good Boy\r\n14 .Jazz Music\r\n15 .Love&apos;s Labour&apos;s Lost\r\n16 .No Jive\r\n\r\n                 ****You don&apos;t have to thank me...Just seed back!****\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 ****Cheers!****","last_updated":"2018-01-01T12:03:48.167Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:2576b3d669c45bbfd1ef2024ed962a6028b61956","dn":"De Phazz - Beyond Lounge Best Of (2002) {FLAC} vtwin88cube   ","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"2576b3d669c45bbfd1ef2024ed962a6028b61956","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,118,179,214,105,196,91,191,209,239,32,36,237,150,42,96,40,182,25,86]},"name":"De Phazz - Beyond Lounge Best Of (2002) {FLAC} vtwin88cube   ","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
