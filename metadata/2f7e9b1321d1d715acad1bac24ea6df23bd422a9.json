Secure in work, contemplation, and dreams of the wider world, a miracle bursts into Aidan&apos;s quiet life. He is chosen to accompany a small band of monks on a quest to the fabled city of Byzantium, where they are to present the beautiful and costly hand-illuminated Book of Kells to the emperor of all Christendom.\r\n\r\nDuring this expedition by sea and over land, Aidan becomes, by turns, a warrior and a sailor, a slave and a spy, a Viking and a Saracen, and finally, a man. He sees more of the world than most men of his time, becoming an ambassador to kings and an intimate of Byzantium&apos;s fabled Golden Court. And finally, this valiant Irish monk faces the greatest trial confronting any man in any age: the command of his own destiny.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-08-05T12:00:43.664Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f7e9b1321d1d715acad1bac24ea6df23bd422a9","dn":"Byzantium by Stephen R Lawhead ePUB MOBI eBOOK-ZAK","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"2f7e9b1321d1d715acad1bac24ea6df23bd422a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,126,155,19,33,209,215,21,172,173,27,172,36,234,109,242,59,212,34,169]},"name":"Byzantium by Stephen R Lawhead ePUB MOBI eBOOK-ZAK","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
