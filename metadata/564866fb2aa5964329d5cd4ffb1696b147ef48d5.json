Duncan loves Annie, but then, all of a sudden, he doesn&apos;t. Duncan really loves Tucker Crowe, a reclusive Dylanish singer-songwriter who stopped making music 10 years ago. Annie stops loving Duncan, and starts getting her own life. In doing so, she initiates an e-mail correspondence with Tucker, and a connection is forged between two lonely people who are looking for more out of what they&apos;ve got.\r\n\r\nTucker&apos;s been languishing (and he&apos;s unnervingly aware of it), living in rural Pennsylvania with what he sees as his one hope for redemption amid a life of emotional and artistic ruin - his young son, Jackson. But then there&apos;s also the new material he&apos;s about to release to the world: an acoustic, stripped-down version of his greatest album, Juliet - entitled, Juliet, Naked.\r\n\r\nWhat happens when a washed-up musician looks for another chance? And miles away, a restless, childless woman looks for a change? Juliet, Naked is a powerfully engrossing, humblingly humorous novel about music, love, loneliness, and the struggle to live up to one&apos;s promise.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-07-05T12:00:14.318Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:564866fb2aa5964329d5cd4ffb1696b147ef48d5","dn":"Juliet, Naked by Nick Hornby epub RtR","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"564866fb2aa5964329d5cd4ffb1696b147ef48d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,72,102,251,42,165,150,67,41,213,205,79,251,22,150,177,71,239,72,213]},"name":"Juliet, Naked by Nick Hornby epub RtR","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
