DeStefano EPUB\r\n\r\nOne of the biggest scores in Mafia history, the Lufthansa Airlines heist of 1978 has become the stuff of Mafia legend - and a decades-long investigation that continues to this day. Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter Anthony DeStefano sheds new light on this legendary unsolved case using recent evidence from the 2015 trial of 80-year-old Mafia don Vincent Asaro, who for the first time speaks out on his role in the fateful Lufthansa heist. This blistering you-are-there account takes you behind the headlines and inside the ranks of America&apos;s infamous crime families - with never-before-told stories, late-breaking news, and bombshell revelations.\r\n\r\nAn invaluable addition to any crime library, this is the most complete, thorough, and up-to-date account of the Lufthansa heist currently available. Pulitzer Prize winner Anthony DeStefano draws from his years of experience reporting on the mob for New York Newsday - as well as his firsthand coverage of the Asaro indictment and attendance at the trial - to expose the all-too-human heart of organized crime in America. The Big Heist is thrilling, shocking, and impossible to pause.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-10-28T12:03:06.324Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:377b80f142899e16aa92854e8f62fab58596eab1","dn":"The Big Heist by Anthony M.
