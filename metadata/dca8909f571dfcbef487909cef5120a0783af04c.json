In the fall of 2012, she went through a harrowing cycle of panic attacks and dread that wouldn&apos;t abate for months. So she began @sosadtoday, an anonymous Twitter feed that allowed her to express her darkest feelings and that quickly gained a dedicated following.\r\n\r\nIn So Sad Today, Broder delves deeper into the existential themes she explores on Twitter, grappling with sex, death, love, low self-esteem, addiction, and the drama of waiting for the universe to text you back. With insights as sharp as her humor, Broder explores - in prose that is both ballsy and beautiful, aggressively colloquial and achingly poetic - questions most of us are afraid to even acknowledge, let alone answer, in order to discover what it really means to be a person in this modern world.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-01-31T12:06:21.930Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:dca8909f571dfcbef487909cef5120a0783af04c","dn":"So Sad Today_ Personal Essays by Melissa Broder EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"dca8909f571dfcbef487909cef5120a0783af04c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,168,144,159,87,29,252,190,244,135,144,156,239,81,32,160,120,58,240,76]},"name":"So Sad Today_ Personal Essays by Melissa Broder EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
