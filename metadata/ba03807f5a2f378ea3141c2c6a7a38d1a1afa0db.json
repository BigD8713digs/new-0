It is scheduled for release on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Microsoft Windows, OS X, and Linux in 2017. The game&apos;s early access began for Windows in June 2015, for OS X and Linux in July 2015, for Xbox One in December 2015, and for PlayStation 4 in December 2016. In the game, players must survive being stranded on an island filled with roaming dinosaurs and other prehistoric animals, natural hazards, and potentially hostile human players. \r\nThe game is played from either a third-person or first-person view and its world is navigated on foot or by riding a prehistoric animal. Players use firearms and improvised weapons to defend against hostile humans and creatures, with the ability to build bases as defense. The game has both single-player and multiplayer options. \r\nDevelopment began in October 2014. The development team conducted research into the physical appearance of the animals, but took creative license for gameplay purposes. One of the game modes, Survival of the Fittest, was released as a free standalone game in March 2016. Egypt-based developer Instinct Games was hired to facilitate the game&apos;s development. Three DLCs (The Center, Primitive Plus, and Scorched Earth) were also released","last_updated":"2017-07-13T12:02:04.858Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba03807f5a2f378ea3141c2c6a7a38d1a1afa0db","dn":"ARK Survival Evolved v261.1 - Multiplayer - 3 DLCS - Ragnarok","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"ba03807f5a2f378ea3141c2c6a7a38d1a1afa0db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,3,128,127,90,47,55,142,163,20,28,44,106,122,56,209,161,175,160,219]},"name":"ARK Survival Evolved v261.1 - Multiplayer - 3 DLCS - Ragnarok","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
