A string of emotionally intense and conceptually dense albums included 2006&apos;s Happy Hollow, 2009&apos;s Mama, I&apos;m Swollen, and 2012&apos;s I Am Gemini, the sometimes Byzantine saga of twins separated at birth. Eighth album Vitriola marks the first new music from the band since I Am Gemini and goes in a different direction, with lyricist/guitarist/vocalist Tim Kasher turning away from traditionally intertwined narrative songwriting. Rather than linking lyrical Venn diagrams, the ten songs here largely inspect feelings of rage, hopelessness, and anxiety in an endlessly frustrating political climate. Musically, a somewhat reshuffled lineup (original drummer Clint Schnase returns after over a decade, and touring cellist Megan Siebe makes her first recorded appearance) reawakens some of the energy of earlier albums, like the reintroduction of a cello to the band&apos;s sound that recalls 2003 high point The Ugly Organ. From its first moments, Vitriola crackles with tension and anguish","last_updated":"2018-10-07T12:48:54.706Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:7311f4f7239ed1f734215eefe344aa3f394649f6","dn":"Cursive - Vitriola (2018) [16.44 FLAC]","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"7311f4f7239ed1f734215eefe344aa3f394649f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,17,244,247,35,158,209,247,52,33,94,239,227,68,170,63,57,70,73,246]},"name":"Cursive - Vitriola (2018) [16.44 FLAC]","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
