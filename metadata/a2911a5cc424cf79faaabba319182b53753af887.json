Whilst the amateurs of his time brought back their landscape paintings as evidence of their travels in Italy, Canaletto became the incarnation of La Serenissima of the baroque period.\r\n\r\nA forerunner in his method of spacing out the different planes of his works, he embellished his pictures with details in order to better highlight the distances, and used a camera obscura in the composition of his paintings. With the precision of the lines and the tonality of the palette, Canaletto&apos;s paintings are still, defined by his own hand, the most beautiful panoramas in the history of art.\r\n\r\nIn course of this inspired, richly-illustrated text, Octave Uzanne revives the reader&apos;s passion for this striking Venetian painter of the seventeenth century","last_updated":"2017-06-03T12:05:31.829Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2911a5cc424cf79faaabba319182b53753af887","dn":"Canaletto (Temporis Collection)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"a2911a5cc424cf79faaabba319182b53753af887","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,145,26,92,196,36,207,121,250,170,187,163,25,24,43,83,117,58,248,135]},"name":"Canaletto (Temporis Collection)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
