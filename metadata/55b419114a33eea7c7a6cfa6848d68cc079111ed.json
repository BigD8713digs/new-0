With heavy focus on aliens over the past five decades, very few people have noticed the role that the U.S. military/government and its black ops sub-factions have played in the role of experimenting on it own personnel, their families, and the population in general. Many people have signs of having been tinkered with and programmed but don&apos;t realize it, and even shy away from pursuing the subject, because the grandiose term of &quot;abduction&quot; with its space alien implications doesn&apos;t fit their more subtle situation.\r\n\r\n&quot;Chasing Phantoms&quot; offers various perspectives on all the main aspects of military and MILAB lore.\r\n\r\nToo often, the available abduction material winds the reader up into a negative state and then leaves them hanging on the line, feeling fearful and powerless about their situation. Unlike those books, &quot;Chasing Phantoms&quot; offers tactical tips and advise gleaned from the author&apos;s personal experiences to empower the reader and show how much of the negative harassment in abductees&apos; lives can be stopped","last_updated":"2017-06-04T12:03:32.536Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:55b419114a33eea7c7a6cfa6848d68cc079111ed","dn":"Carissa Conti - Chasing Phantoms - pdf [TKRG]","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"55b419114a33eea7c7a6cfa6848d68cc079111ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,180,25,17,74,51,238,167,199,166,207,166,132,141,104,204,7,145,17,237]},"name":"Carissa Conti - Chasing Phantoms - pdf [TKRG]","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
