He is widely considered one of the most important American poets of the postwar era.\n\nLowell worked in a number of distinctive stylistic modes and forms over the course of his career.  In his poetry he expressed the major tensions -- both public and private -- of his time with technical mastery and haunting authenticity.  His LIFE STUDIES (1959), which won the National Book Award for poetry, featured a new emphasis on intense, uninhibited discussion of personal, family, and psychological struggles.  The volume contains an autobiographical essay, &#x201C;91 Revere Street,&#x201D; as well as a series of 15 confessional poems.  Chief among these are &#x201C;Waking in Blue,&#x201D; which tells of his confinement in a mental hospital, and &#x201C;Skunk Hour,&#x201D; which conveys his mental turmoil with dramatic intensity.\n\nLowell&#x2019;s activities in the civil-rights and antiwar campaigns of the 1960s lent a more public note to his next three books of poetry: FOR THE UNION DEAD (1964), NEAR THE OCEAN (1967), and NOTEBOOK 1967-68 (1969).  The last-named work is a poetic record of a tumultuous year in the poet&#x2019;s life and exhibits the interrelation between politics, the individual, and his culture.  Lowell&#x2019;s trilogy of plays, THE OLD GLORY (1965), views American culture over the span of history.  His later poetry volumes include THE DOLPHIN (1973), which won the Pulitzer Prize, and DAY BY DAY (1977).  His translations include PROMETHEUS BOUND (1969) and IMITATIONS (1961), the latter being free renderings of various European poets.\n\n\nThe following books are in PDF format unless otherwise noted:\n\n* Collected Prose (FSG, 1987).
