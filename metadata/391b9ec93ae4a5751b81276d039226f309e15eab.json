Each chapter has a strict chapter format that includes the indications and contraindications for each procedure, a list of equipment and drugs, a step-by-step illustration-focused how-to, a list of possible post-procedural complications, and bullet-pointed clinical pearls and pitfalls. Within each chapter the authors will also cover the variations of each procedure due to di?erent equipment. \r\nThis book is ideal for pain medicine fellows, spine surgeons, and interventional pain physicians who want access to the best minds and specialized procedures in a single package.\r\n <a href=\"\nhttps://s31.postimg.cc/ry9tc8vm3/Advanced_Procedures_for_Pain_Management_-_A_Step-by-_Step_Atlas.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://s31.postimg.cc/ry9tc8vm3/Advanced_Procedures_for_Pain_Management_-_A_Step-by-_Step_Atlas.jpg</a>","last_updated":"2018-05-04T12:09:28.413Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:391b9ec93ae4a5751b81276d039226f309e15eab","dn":"Advanced Procedures for Pain Management (gnv64)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"391b9ec93ae4a5751b81276d039226f309e15eab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,27,158,201,58,228,165,117,27,129,39,109,3,146,38,243,9,225,94,171]},"name":"Advanced Procedures for Pain Management (gnv64)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
