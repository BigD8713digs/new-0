From the Bodleian, the Folger and the Smithsonian to the fabled libraries of middle earth, Umberto Eco&#x2019;s mediaeval library labyrinth and libraries dreamed up by John Donne, Jorge Luis Borges and Carlos Ruiz Zaf&#xF3;n, Stuart Kells explores the bookish places, real and fictitious, that continue to capture our imaginations.\r\n\r\nThe Library: A Catalogue of Wonders is a fascinating and engaging exploration of libraries as places of beauty and wonder. It&#x2019;s a celebration of books as objects and an account of the deeply personal nature of these hallowed spaces by one of Australia&#x2019;s leading bibliophiles.\r\n\r\nStuart Kells is an author and book-trade historian. His 2015 book, Penguin and the Lane Brothers, won the Ashurst Business Literature Prize. An authority on rare books, he has written and published on many aspects of print culture and the book world. Stuart lives in Melbourne with his family. He is writing a book about Shakespeare&#x2019;s library.\r\n\r\nPrint Length: 237 pages\r\nPublisher: Text Publishing (August 28, 2017)","last_updated":"2017-09-05T12:07:13.151Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d6f7716698a12882057b86855f83d02db41f642","dn":"The Library: A Catalogue of Wonders","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"9d6f7716698a12882057b86855f83d02db41f642","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,111,119,22,105,138,18,136,32,87,184,104,85,248,61,2,219,65,246,66]},"name":"The Library: A Catalogue of Wonders","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
