Through medication, he dyed his skin dark and left his family and home in Texas to find out.\r\n\r\nThe setting is the Deep South in 1959. What began as scientific research ended up changing his life in every way imaginable. When he decided the real story was in his journals, he published them, and the storm that followed is now part of American history.\r\n\r\nAs performed by Ray Childs, this first-ever recording of Black Like Me will leave each listener deeply affected. John Howard Griffin did the impossible to help bring the full effect of racism to the forefront of America&apos;s conscience.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-07-01T12:12:04.671Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5573354a51fd7b272aa3d33b42cfdccd1c95915","dn":"Black Like Me by John Howard Griffin EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"a5573354a51fd7b272aa3d33b42cfdccd1c95915","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,87,51,84,165,31,215,178,114,170,61,51,180,44,253,204,209,201,89,21]},"name":"Black Like Me by John Howard Griffin EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
