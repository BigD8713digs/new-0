Warnatz et al. (Springer, 2006).pdf\r\n\r\nThis book provides a rigorous treatment of the coupling of chemical reactions and fluid flow. Combustion-specific topics of chemistry and fluid mechanics are considered and tools described for the simulation of combustion processes. This edition is completely restructured. Mathematical Formulae and derivations as well as the space-consuming reaction mechanisms have been replaced from the text to appendix. A new chapter discusses the impact of combustion processes on the atmosphere, the chapter on auto-ignition is extended to combustion in Otto- and Diesel-engines, and the chapters on heterogeneous combustion and on soot formation are heavily revised","last_updated":"2017-06-08T12:01:16.943Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:50ea3623318867b45f2ef2a305e394a2abed9e19","dn":"Combustion 4th ed - J.
