Now her eyes are open, and he&apos;s not going away.\r\n\r\nGwen Proctor won the battle to save her kids from her ex-husband, serial killer Melvin Royal, and his league of psychotic accomplices. But the war isn&apos;t over. Not since Melvin broke out of prison. Not since she received a chilling text...\r\n\r\nYou&apos;re not safe anywhere now.\r\n\r\nHer refuge at Stillhouse Lake has be-come a trap. Gwen leaves her children in the protective custody of a fortified, well-armed neighbor. Now, with the help of Sam Cade, brother of one of Melvin&apos;s victims, Gwen is going hunting. She&apos;s learned how from one of the sickest killers alive.\r\n\r\nBut what she&apos;s up against is beyond any-thing she feared - a sophisticated and savage mind game calculated to destroy her. As trust beyond her small circle of friends begins to vanish, Gwen has only fury and vengeance to believe in as she closes in on her prey. And sure as the night, one of them will die","last_updated":"2017-12-31T12:00:45.950Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:cde91ee2419c29b16c32cccdcca927d1951ec492","dn":"Rachel Caine-Killman Creek","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"cde91ee2419c29b16c32cccdcca927d1951ec492","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,233,30,226,65,156,41,177,108,50,204,205,204,169,39,209,149,30,196,146]},"name":"Rachel Caine-Killman Creek","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
