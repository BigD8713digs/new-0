And if the reader does find himself at the point of man vs. nature, Leonard shares survival skills from how to bandage a wound and read a topographical map, to how to drive on sand and remove a tick from your skin&#x2014;all organized thematically and written in short takeaway entries with helpful line drawings. \r\n\r\nBound in a uniquely rugged (and waterproof!) PVC cover material, The Great Outdoors: A User&#x2019;s Guide is a friendly way into the outdoor lifestyle, whether you&apos;re looking to dabble or go all in.[","last_updated":"2017-08-06T12:01:03.169Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1ad0f8b1fa19d6c5bbe1603fbb0ef15e9b5161d","dn":"The Great Outdoors - A User's Guide (2017) (Epub) Gooner","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"b1ad0f8b1fa19d6c5bbe1603fbb0ef15e9b5161d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,173,15,139,31,161,157,108,91,190,22,3,251,176,239,21,233,181,22,29]},"name":"The Great Outdoors - A User's Guide (2017) (Epub) Gooner","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
