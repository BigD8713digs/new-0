I personally like to use avast! Firewall which comes with the Premiere edition of avast!. \r\nAnd if you don&apos;t block FL from accessing the internet chances are too damn high that your license will be banned and your machine ID will be blacklisted in Image-Line servers so you might not be able to use the method I provide again or maybe never ever. Remember to block FL from accessing the internet using a firewall. BLOCK ALL THE EXE FILES!\r\nThis is not a final solution for your first world problem.. Just wait till R2R or one of those legends rise and &quot;FiKs da Bugzz&quot; in FL 12.5 ;)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNy2rogen/Team PH4T0G3N","last_updated":"2017-08-05T12:01:33.218Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:12d204756d8d92990c1e9a183d3a085954664940","dn":"FL Studio 12.5.0.58 (Incl.
