They called their new club the Ku Klux Klan, and it quickly grew into the self-proclaimed Invisible Empire, with secret dens spreading across the South.\r\n\r\nAward-winning author Susan Campbell Bartoletti weaves together vivid personal accounts from oral histories, congressional documents, and diaries in this enlightening, surprising, and disquieting story, which has received a slew of starred reviews from Kirkus, Publisher&#x2019;s Weekly, Booklist, and other esteemed publications. Her extensive research places the length of the Klan&#x2019;s history into a larger context that sheds new light on the roots of hate groups.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-11-03T12:09:28.001Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:564a08d0b35026a89bb164436c180d10160cd2a7","dn":"They Called Themselves the KKK by Susan Campbell Bartoletti EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"564a08d0b35026a89bb164436c180d10160cd2a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,74,8,208,179,80,38,168,155,177,100,67,108,24,13,16,22,12,210,167]},"name":"They Called Themselves the KKK by Susan Campbell Bartoletti EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
