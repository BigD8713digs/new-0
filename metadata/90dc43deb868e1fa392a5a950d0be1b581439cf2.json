It&#x2019;s a past that almost no one remembers except for the few who dare to return and once more reclaim all that once was and begin to build what is to become. Journey deep into the jungle and follow the story of a warrior who reclaims a kingdom, only to ache for the completion of a prophecy spoken over him by a dying father. A prophecy that comes in the form of a red haired fantasy lady, who is born up the river by chance and circumstance or perhaps by Divine will, and that must be claimed and utterly brought into submission as his queen","last_updated":"2017-09-26T12:04:05.354Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:90dc43deb868e1fa392a5a950d0be1b581439cf2","dn":"A Lady's Submission - True PDF","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"90dc43deb868e1fa392a5a950d0be1b581439cf2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,220,67,222,184,104,225,250,57,42,90,149,13,11,225,181,129,67,156,242]},"name":"A Lady's Submission - True PDF","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
