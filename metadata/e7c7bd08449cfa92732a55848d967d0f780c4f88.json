But having everything we thought we wanted isn&apos;t making us happier. It&apos;s bad for the planet. It&apos;s cluttering up our homes. It&apos;s making us feel &apos;stuffocated&apos; and stressed - and it might even be killing us.\r\n\r\nTrend forecaster James Wallman finds that a rising number of people are turning their backs on all-you-can-get consumption, from the telecoms exec who&apos;s sold almost everything he owns to the well-off family who have moved into a remote mountain cabin.\r\n\r\nWallman&apos;s solution to our clutter crisis is less extreme but equally fundamental. We have to transform what we value. We have to focus less on possessions and more on experiences. Rather than a new watch or another pair of shoes, we should invest in shared experiences like holidays and time with friends.\r\n\r\nWith intriguing insights on psychology, economics and culture, Stuffocation is a vital manifesto for change. It has inspired those who have heard it to be happier and healthier and to live more with less.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-06-17T12:02:56.812Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:e7c7bd08449cfa92732a55848d967d0f780c4f88","dn":"Stuffocation: Living More with Less by James Wallman EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"e7c7bd08449cfa92732a55848d967d0f780c4f88","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,199,189,8,68,156,250,146,115,42,85,132,141,150,125,15,120,12,79,136]},"name":"Stuffocation: Living More with Less by James Wallman EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
