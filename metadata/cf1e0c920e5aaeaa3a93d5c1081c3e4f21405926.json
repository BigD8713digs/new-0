It explores the multifaceted history of state power and highlights the ways in which different political systems responded to, and were deformed by, the near-unbearable pressures of war. Every state involved faced issues of military-civilian relations, parliamentary reviews of military policy, and the growth of war economies; and yet their particular form and significance varied in every national case. Written by a global team of historical experts, this volume sets new standards in the political history of the waging of war in an authoritative new narrative which addresses problems of logistics, morale, innovation in tactics and weapons systems, the use and abuse of science; all of which were ubiquitous during the conflict.\r\n\r\nGenre: Non-Fiction &gt; History","last_updated":"2018-10-13T12:43:28.862Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf1e0c920e5aaeaa3a93d5c1081c3e4f21405926","dn":"The First World War: Volume 2, The State by Jay Winter (.epub)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"cf1e0c920e5aaeaa3a93d5c1081c3e4f21405926","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,30,12,146,14,90,174,170,58,147,213,193,8,28,62,79,33,64,89,38]},"name":"The First World War: Volume 2, The State by Jay Winter (.epub)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
