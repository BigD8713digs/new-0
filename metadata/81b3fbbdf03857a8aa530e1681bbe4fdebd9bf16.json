In this unique book he takes his own experiences and widens them out to look at the social, historical and political factors that have left us where we are today.\r\n\r\nCovering everything from the police, education and identity to politics, sexual objectification and the far right, Natives will speak directly to British denial and squeamishness when it comes to confronting issues of race and class that are at the heart of the legacy of Britain&apos;s racialised empire.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-09-09T12:21:33.286Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:81b3fbbdf03857a8aa530e1681bbe4fdebd9bf16","dn":"Natives: Race and Class in the Ruins of Empire by Akala EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"81b3fbbdf03857a8aa530e1681bbe4fdebd9bf16","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,179,251,189,240,56,87,168,170,83,14,22,129,187,228,253,235,217,191,22]},"name":"Natives: Race and Class in the Ruins of Empire by Akala EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
