Astonished, Alice follows the Rabbit, and tumbles down the deep hole. She falls down and down, and lands in a wonderland where everything is bizarre and magical!\r\nThe character Alice is immortalised in the classic, &apos;Alice&apos;s Adventures in Wonderland&apos; by Lewis Carroll. There are many such classic stories, novels, and fairy tales which are loved by children across the globe. &apos;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,&apos; the &apos;Panchatantra Stories,&apos; &apos;Aesop&apos;s Fables&apos; etc, are some among them. These books let the child to fly on the wings of fantasy and imagination.\r\nThis issue of &apos;Tell Me Why&apos; lists some of the classic books for children that one should read.
