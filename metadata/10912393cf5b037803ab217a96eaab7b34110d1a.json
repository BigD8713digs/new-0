When Ho-sang&apos;s body is initially missing, the media sensationalizes the case by scapegoating him. In a battle for ratings, cold and calculating MSC reporter Song Cha-Ok alleges that Ho-sang survived the blast, and is currently in hiding because he was responsible for the deaths of his men. This causes the Ki family to become outcasts in their neighborhood and objects of national scorn. Ki Ho-sang&apos;s wife kills herself and her younger son (Ha-myeong) by jumping off a cliff, and Jae-myeong blames their deaths on the media, particularly Cha-ok.\r\n\r\nThe lives of local news reporters, engaged in fierce battle as they hunt for truth 24 hours a day, grow closer to each other as they go through youth in this young adult drama.\r\n\r\nEpisodes: 20\r\nRelease Date: November 12, 2014 - January 15, 2015\r\nSubtitle: English\r\n <a href=\"\nhttp://asianwiki.com/File:Pinocchio_(Korean_Drama)-p1.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttp://asianwiki.com/File:Pinocchio_(Korean_Drama)-p1.jpg</a>\r\n\r\nCast:\r\nLee Jong-suk as Choi Dal-po/Gi Ha-myung\r\nPark Shin-hye as Choi In-ha","last_updated":"2018-07-17T12:02:29.996Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:10912393cf5b037803ab217a96eaab7b34110d1a","dn":"Pinocchio (2014) -  Korean Drama","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"10912393cf5b037803ab217a96eaab7b34110d1a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,145,35,147,207,91,3,120,3,171,33,122,150,234,171,123,52,17,13,26]},"name":"Pinocchio (2014) -  Korean Drama","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
