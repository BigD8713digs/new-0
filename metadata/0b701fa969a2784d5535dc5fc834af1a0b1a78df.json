It tells the epic story of angels, from Creation to Evolution and through to the operations of the supernatural in the modern world. This tale of how people and peoples have been helped by angels and other angelic beings is woven into a spellbinding narrative that brings together Krishna, Moses, Buddha, Elijah, Mary and Jesus, Mohammed, Joan of Arc, the angels who helped Hungarian Jews persecuted by the Nazis, and stories from African, Native American, and Celtic traditions.\r\n\r\nTold from the spiritual point of view, The Sacred History relates every betrayal, every change of heart, every twist and turn, everything that looks like a coincidence, every portent, every clue, every defeat, every rescue moments before the prison door clangs shut. This is the angelic version of events.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-11-23T12:04:00.696Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b701fa969a2784d5535dc5fc834af1a0b1a78df","dn":"The Sacred History_ How Angels, Mystics .. by Mark Booth EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"0b701fa969a2784d5535dc5fc834af1a0b1a78df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,112,31,169,105,162,120,77,85,53,220,95,200,52,175,26,11,26,120,223]},"name":"The Sacred History_ How Angels, Mystics .. by Mark Booth EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
