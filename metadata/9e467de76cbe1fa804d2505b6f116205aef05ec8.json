All her life everyone has tried to protect her from the realities of the world, but Ella knows very well the danger that has haunted her brother and their friend, and she won&apos;t wait for it to strike again. She intends to take action . . . and if that happens to involve an adventurous trip to the Cotswolds, then so much the better.\r\n\r\nLord Cayton has already broken two hearts, including that of his first wife, who died before he could convince himself to love her. Now he&apos;s determined to live a better life. But that proves complicated when old friends arrive on the scene and try to threaten him into a life of crime. He does his best to remove the intriguing Lady Ella from danger, but the stubborn girl won&apos;t budge. How else can he redeem himself, though, but by saving her--and his daughter--from those dangerous people who seem ready to destroy them all?","last_updated":"2017-07-30T12:05:18.746Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e467de76cbe1fa804d2505b6f116205aef05ec8","dn":"A Lady Unrivaled - Roseanna M.
