Passed down by word of mouth for five thousand years, they teach of an absolute and unified field of intelligence that underlies and permeates all creation. This divine ground is our own nature, and to bring our lives into conscious harmony with it is the ultimate purpose of human existence.\r\n\r\nThis lucid translation captures both the poetry and the precision of the original, rendering accessible an extraordinary body of spiritual wisdom as never before. Speaking from the depth of the everlasting NOW, the Upanishads make the mind soar and the heart sing, and point the soul to freedom.\r\n\r\nHardcover: 176 pages\r\nPublisher: Harmony; 1 edition (June 3, 2003)\r\nLanguage: English\r\nISBN-10: 0609611070\r\nISBN-13: 978-0609611074\r\n <a href=\"\nhttps://www.amazon.co.uk/Upanishads-Alistair-Shearer/dp/0609611070\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://www.amazon.co.uk/Upanishads-Alistair-Shearer/dp/0609611070</a>","last_updated":"2017-09-18T12:07:35.160Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b696333b871fb6dc7614a4490ade48d6fb2be85","dn":"The Upanishads 2003 by Alistair Shearer, Peter Russell (Trans)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"2b696333b871fb6dc7614a4490ade48d6fb2be85","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,105,99,51,184,113,251,109,199,97,74,68,144,173,228,141,111,178,190,133]},"name":"The Upanishads 2003 by Alistair Shearer, Peter Russell (Trans)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
