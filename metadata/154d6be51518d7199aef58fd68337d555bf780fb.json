Also? The best sentences and, what do you call them, paragraphs. My previous books were great and sold extremely, unbelievably well - even the ones by dishonest, disgusting so-called journalists. But those writers didn&apos;t understand Trump, because, quite frankly, they were major losers. People say if you want it done right you have to do it yourself, even when &apos;it&apos; is a &apos;memoir&apos;. So every word of this book was written by me, using a special advanced word processing system during the many, many nights I&apos;ve been forced to stay alone in the White House - only me, just me, trust me, nobody helped. And it&apos;s all 100 percent true, so true - people are already saying it may be the truest book ever published. Enjoy.&quot;\r\n\r\nUntil Donald Trump publishes the ultimate account of his entire four or eight or one and a half years in the White House, the definitive chronicle will be You Can&apos;t Spell America Without Me: The Really Tremendous Inside Story of My Fantastic First Year as President Donald J. Trump. Trump was elected because he was the most frank presidential candidate in history, a man eager to tell the unvarnished truth about others&apos; flaws and tout his own amazing excellence. Now he levels his refreshingly compulsive, un-PC candor at his landslide election victory as well as his role as commander in chief and leader of the free world.\r\n\r\nThere are intimate, powerful, mind-boggling revelations throughout. You are there with him during his private encounters with world leaders, a few of whom he does not insult. You are there at the genius Oval Office strategy sessions with his advisers. You are there in his White House bedroom as he crafts the predawn Twitter pronouncements that rock the world. And, of course, you are there on the golf course as Trump attempts to manage the burdens of his office.\r\n\r\n..\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-11-17T12:00:44.665Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:154d6be51518d7199aef58fd68337d555bf780fb","dn":"You Can't Spell America Without Me by Alec Baldwin EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"154d6be51518d7199aef58fd68337d555bf780fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,77,107,229,21,24,215,25,154,239,88,253,104,51,125,85,91,247,128,251]},"name":"You Can't Spell America Without Me by Alec Baldwin EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
