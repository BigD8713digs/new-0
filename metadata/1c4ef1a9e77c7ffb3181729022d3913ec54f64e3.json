Anything resembling advice should be taken at readers&apos;s own risk. You&apos;ll never get divorced if you never get married. Not even your granny minds if you live in sin anymore. And if you&apos;re single you can choose curtains without somebody else butting in. So why bother with marriage? It can&apos;t just be an easy way round having to buy your own deodorant.\r\n\r\nGuardian columnist Tim Dowling is a husband of some 20 years. His marriage is resounding proof that even the most impossible partnership can work out for the best. Some of the time. So while this book is called How to Be a Husband, it&apos;s not really a how-to guide at all. Nor is it a compendium of petty remarks and brinkmanship - although it contains plenty of both. You may pick up a few DIY hints. You might learn that while marriage is founded on love, it endures through bloody hard work. Most likely it will make you whimper with the laughter of painful recognition. How to be a Husband is a cautionary tale about throwing caution to the wind. It&apos;s the strange romance of two people consenting to share a roll-on. It&apos;s a new manifesto for marriage and an answer to why, even when we suck at it, we stick at it.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-07-14T12:00:49.235Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c4ef1a9e77c7ffb3181729022d3913ec54f64e3","dn":"How to Be a Husband by Tim Dowling EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"1c4ef1a9e77c7ffb3181729022d3913ec54f64e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,78,241,169,231,124,127,251,49,129,114,144,34,211,145,62,197,79,100,227]},"name":"How to Be a Husband by Tim Dowling EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
