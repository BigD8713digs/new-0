The three siblings are scions of the wealthy family from which Laila&apos;s father had been estranged long before his own untimely demise 10 years before.\r\n\r\nTwo years later, Laila has left behind her quiet life in Grosse Point, Michigan to move to New York City, landing her smack in the middle of her cousins&apos; decadent world. As the truth about why Laila&apos;s parents became estranged from the family patriarch becomes clear, Laila grows ever more resolved to claim what&apos;s rightfully hers.\r\n\r\nCaught between longing for the love of her family and her relentless pursuit of the lifestyle she feels she was unfairly denied, Laila finds herself reawakening a long dead family scandal - not to mention setting off several new ones - as she becomes further enmeshed in the lives and love affairs of her cousins. But will Laila ever, truly, belong in their world?\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-02-07T12:05:03.954Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee3b7ac7932ea7bb7f5758be06182a4d74cd182e","dn":"She Regrets Nothing_ A Novel by Andrea Dunlop EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"ee3b7ac7932ea7bb7f5758be06182a4d74cd182e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,59,122,199,147,46,167,187,127,87,88,190,6,24,42,77,116,205,24,46]},"name":"She Regrets Nothing_ A Novel by Andrea Dunlop EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
