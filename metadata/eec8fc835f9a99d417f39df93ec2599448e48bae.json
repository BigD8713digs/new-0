A beautiful townhouse on the best street in the neighbourhood. Three bright children who are her pride and joy. \r\n\r\nSometimes her past still hurts: losing her mother early, growing up in foster care. But her husband, Simon, is always there. A successful surgeon, he&#x2019;s the envy of every woman they&#x2019;ve ever met. Flowers, gifts, trips to France: nothing is too good for his family. \r\n\r\nThen Simon says another woman&#x2019;s name. The way he lingers on it, Caroline, gives Marianne a shudder of suspicion, but she knows it&#x2019;s nothing - she can&#x2019;t entertain this flash of paranoia. \r\n\r\nIn the old days, she&#x2019;d have distracted herself by excelling at work, but Marianne left her glamorous career when she married. She&#x2019;d speak to a friend, but she&#x2019;s too busy with her children and besides, Simon doesn&#x2019;t approve of the few she has left. \r\n\r\nIt&#x2019;s almost by accident that Marianne starts to learn more about Caroline. But once started, she can&#x2019;t stop, because what she finds makes her wonder: is the question she should be asking not &quot;should I be jealous&quot; but...&quot;should I be scared?&quot;\r\n\r\nFans of The Girl on the Train and I Let You Go who are looking for a dark, gripping psychological thriller with a final twist to put their jaw on the floor will love Our Little Lies.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-10-14T12:05:34.964Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:eec8fc835f9a99d417f39df93ec2599448e48bae","dn":"Our Little Lies by Sue Watson EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"eec8fc835f9a99d417f39df93ec2599448e48bae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,200,252,131,95,154,153,212,23,243,157,249,62,194,89,148,72,228,139,174]},"name":"Our Little Lies by Sue Watson EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
