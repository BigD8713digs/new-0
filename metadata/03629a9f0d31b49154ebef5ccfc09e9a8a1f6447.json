How can a physical brain create our experience of the world? What creates our identity? Do we really have free will? Could consciousness itself be an illusion? Exciting new developments in brain science are opening up these debates, and the field has now expanded to include biologists, neuroscientists, psychologists, and philosophers. \r\n\r\nThis book clarifies the potentially confusing arguments and clearly describes the major theories. Topics include vision and attention, theories of self, experiments on action and awareness, altered states of consciousness, and the effects of brain damage and drugs. \r\n\r\nThis lively, engaging, and authoritative book provides a clear overview of the subject that combines the perspectives of philosophy, psychology, and neuroscience - and serves as a much-needed launch pad for further exploration of this complicated and unsolved issue. \r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-04-23T12:02:32.762Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:03629a9f0d31b49154ebef5ccfc09e9a8a1f6447","dn":"Consciousness: A Very Short Introduction by Susan Blackmore EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"03629a9f0d31b49154ebef5ccfc09e9a8a1f6447","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,98,154,159,13,49,180,145,84,235,239,92,207,192,158,154,138,31,100,71]},"name":"Consciousness: A Very Short Introduction by Susan Blackmore EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
