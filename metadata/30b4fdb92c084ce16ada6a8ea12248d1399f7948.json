When Nicklin announces that he wishes to reveal the whereabouts of one of his earliest victims and that he wants the cop who caught him to be there when he does it, it becomes clear that Thorne&#x2019;s life is about to become seriously unpleasant. Thorne is forced to accompany Nicklin to a remote island off the Welsh coast which is cut off from the mainland in every sense. Shrouded in myth and legend, it is said to be the resting place of 20,000 saints and as Thorne and his team search for bones that are somewhat more recent, it becomes clear that Nicklin&#x2019;s motives are far from altruistic","last_updated":"2018-11-18T12:22:31.122Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:30b4fdb92c084ce16ada6a8ea12248d1399f7948","dn":"Mark Billingham-The Bones Beneath [audio]","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"30b4fdb92c084ce16ada6a8ea12248d1399f7948","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,180,253,185,44,8,76,225,106,218,106,142,161,34,72,209,57,159,121,72]},"name":"Mark Billingham-The Bones Beneath [audio]","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
