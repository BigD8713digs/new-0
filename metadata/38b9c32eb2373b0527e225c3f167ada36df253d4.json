Shot over two years, the film is told through Dominic&apos;s eyes as he struggles to look after his grandad while, at the same time, his grandparents&apos; relationship begins to suffer as a result of Tom&apos;s disease.\r\n\r\nThe film captures Tom&apos;s rapid mental decline and the attempts of his family to care for a once fiercely independent and proud man. But when the family is unable to cope with Tom&apos;s worsening moods and behaviour, Dominic follows his grandad as he is temporarily sectioned into a psychiatric ward.\r\n\r\nOver the following months, Tom is moved from one family home to the next, and then into a nursing home, before being temporarily sectioned again.\r\n\r\nThe film also highlights the effect on Dominic&apos;s grandma Pam who, at 82 years old, is finding it almost impossible to live with the increasingly erratic Tom","last_updated":"2017-07-15T12:02:32.799Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:38b9c32eb2373b0527e225c3f167ada36df253d4","dn":"Granddad.Dementia.Me.EN.SUB.MPEG4.x264.WEBRIP.[MPup]","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"38b9c32eb2373b0527e225c3f167ada36df253d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,185,195,46,178,55,59,5,39,226,37,195,241,103,173,163,109,242,83,212]},"name":"Granddad.Dementia.Me.EN.SUB.MPEG4.x264.WEBRIP.[MPup]","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
