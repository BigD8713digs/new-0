Her mother, her home, even her son. The one bright spot in her loss-filled life, the partner she could always count on, has always been Mack, her gray and black Sheltie - that is, until she is summoned back to her childhood home after more than 20 years away.\r\n\r\nEd and Alice Parmalee are mourning a loss of their own. Seven years after their daughter was taken from them, they&#x2019;re living separate lives together - dancing around each other, and their unspeakable heartbreak, unable to bridge the chasm left between them.\r\n\r\nFiercely loyal, acutely perceptive and guided by a herd dog&#x2019;s instinct, Mack has a way of bringing out the best in his humans. Whether it&#x2019;s a canine freestyle competition or just the ebb and flow of a family&#x2019;s rhythms, it&#x2019;s as though the little Shetland sheepdog was born to bring people together. The Dog Who Danced is his story, one that will surely dance its way into your heart.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-12-04T12:01:15.187Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:542585a480b803323cf0ee12484dbf220c3cc268","dn":"The Dog Who Danced by Susan Wilson EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"542585a480b803323cf0ee12484dbf220c3cc268","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,37,133,164,128,184,3,50,60,240,238,18,72,77,191,34,12,60,194,104]},"name":"The Dog Who Danced by Susan Wilson EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
