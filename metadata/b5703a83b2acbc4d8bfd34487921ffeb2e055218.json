But many of those failures are preventable. The Lean Startup is a new approach being adopted across the globe, changing the way companies are built and new products are launched.\r\n\r\nEric Ries defines a startup as an organization dedicated to creating something new under conditions of extreme uncertainty. This is just as true for one person in a garage or a group of seasoned professionals in a Fortune 500 boardroom. What they have in common is a mission to penetrate that fog of uncertainty to discover a successful path to a sustainable business.\r\n\r\nThe Lean Startup approach fosters companies that are both more capital efficient and that leverage human creativity more effectively. Inspired by lessons from lean manufacturing, it relies on &#x201C;validated learning&#x201D;, rapid scientific experimentation, as well as a number of counter-intuitive practices that shorten product-development cycles, measure actual progress without resorting to vanity metrics, and learn what customers really want. It enables a company to shift directions with agility, altering plans inch by inch, minute by minute.\r\n\r\nRather than wasting time creating elaborate business plans, The Lean Startup offers entrepreneurs - in companies of all sizes - a way to test their vision continuously, to adapt and adjust before it&#x2019;s too late. Ries provides a scientific approach to creating and managing successful startups in a age when companies need to innovate more than ever.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-12-23T12:01:33.034Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5703a83b2acbc4d8bfd34487921ffeb2e055218","dn":"The Lean Startup by Eric Ries MOBI","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"b5703a83b2acbc4d8bfd34487921ffeb2e055218","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,112,58,131,178,172,188,77,139,253,52,72,121,33,255,235,46,5,82,24]},"name":"The Lean Startup by Eric Ries MOBI","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
