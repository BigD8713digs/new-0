Steinbeck creates around the infamous Pippin the most hilarious royal court ever: Pippin&apos;s wife, Queen Marie, who &quot;might have taken her place at the bar of a very good restaurant&quot;; his uncle, a man of dubious virtue; his glamour-struck daughter and her beau, the son of the so-called &quot;egg king&quot; of Petaluma, California; and a motley crew of courtiers and politicians, guards and gardeners.
