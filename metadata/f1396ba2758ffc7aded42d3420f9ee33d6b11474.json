People are dying, but their souls are not being collected. Someone - or something - is stealing them. No one knows where they are going or why, but it has something to do with that big orange bridge.\r\n\r\nDeath merchant Charlie Asher is just as flummoxed as everyone else. He&apos;s trapped in the body of a 14-inch-tall &quot;meat puppet&quot;, waiting for his Buddhist nun girlfriend, Audrey, to find him a suitable new body to play host.\r\n\r\nTo get to the bottom of this abomination, a motley crew of heroes will band together: the seven-foot-tall death merchant Minty Fresh, retired policeman-turned-bookseller Alphonse Rivera, the emperor of San Francisco and his dogs, and Lily, the former Goth girl. Now if only they can get little Sophie to stop babbling about the coming battle for the very soul of humankind","last_updated":"2017-06-19T12:00:24.801Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:f1396ba2758ffc7aded42d3420f9ee33d6b11474","dn":"Christopher Moore - Secondhand Souls A Dirty Job Series Book 2 2","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"f1396ba2758ffc7aded42d3420f9ee33d6b11474","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,57,107,162,117,143,252,122,222,212,45,52,32,249,238,51,214,177,20,116]},"name":"Christopher Moore - Secondhand Souls A Dirty Job Series Book 2 2","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
