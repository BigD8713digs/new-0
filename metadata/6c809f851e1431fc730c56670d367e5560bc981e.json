Wide area networks (WANs) allow data to be shared securely and quickly over long distances. In this course, networking expert Greg Sowell describes how to set up WANs, including networking your workstations with switchs and connecting them to the Internet via a routing device.\r\n\r\nHe discusses different WAN technologies and features such as speeds, spans, and price points&#x2014;including inexpensive options such as VPN. He then covers switches (the devices that connect computers in your building) and routers (devices that control the transmission of network data). Along the way, Greg shows how to build private connections, implement free networking over the Internet, build switch networks, and overlay-routed networks. He&apos;ll also introduce different routing protocols, such as OPSF link-state routing and distance-vector routing with RIPv2, EIGRP, and BGP.\r\n\r\nNote that this course maps to domains 1 and 2 of the Microsoft Technology Associate (MTA) Networking Fundamentals certification exam (98-366).\r\nTopics include:\r\nUnderstanding the technology: from dial-up to VPNs\r\nWorking with hubs, bridges, and switches\r\nEnsuring hardware redundancy\r\nUsing switching types and MAC tables\r\nPreventing bridge loops with STP\r\nRouting with routing tables\r\nUsing NAT\r\nSecuring your switches and routers\r\nSetting up firewalls\r\nWorking with different routing protocols: RIPv2, OSPF, EIGRP, and more","last_updated":"2017-07-16T12:04:15.344Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c809f851e1431fc730c56670d367e5560bc981e","dn":"Lynda - Networking Foundations Network Media (WANs)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"6c809f851e1431fc730c56670d367e5560bc981e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,128,159,133,30,20,49,252,115,12,86,103,13,54,126,85,96,188,152,30]},"name":"Lynda - Networking Foundations Network Media (WANs)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
