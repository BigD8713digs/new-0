Few people doubt that humans are descended from the apes; fewer still consider, let alone accept, the psychological implications. But in truth, man not only looks, moves and breathes like an ape, he also thinks like one. \r\n\r\nSexual drive, survival, competition, aggression - all of our impulses are driven by our human instincts. They explain why a happily married man will fantasize about the pretty, slim, young woman sitting across from him in the tube and why thousands of people spend their week entirely focused on whether their team will win their next crucial match. \r\n\r\nBut how well do our instincts equip us for the twenty-first century? Do they help or hinder us as we deal with large anonymous cities, stressful careers, relationships and the battle of the sexes? In this fascinating book, Robert Winston takes us on a journey deep into the human mind. Along the way he takes a very personal look at the relationship between science and religion and explores those very instincts that make us human","last_updated":"2018-08-25T12:07:32.137Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e01981ee5d9b72d4685e7e8c99a81f2349d2bb5","dn":"Human Instinct by Robert Winston (.epub)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"8e01981ee5d9b72d4685e7e8c99a81f2349d2bb5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,1,152,30,229,217,183,45,70,133,231,232,201,154,129,242,52,157,43,181]},"name":"Human Instinct by Robert Winston (.epub)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
