They explore the emergence of alternative methods of firm financing, including crowdfunding, firm network financing and venture capital, and analyse the performance of listed European innovative firms. The book discusses related topics such as the role of loan dynamics and structure for Central and Eastern European economic growth, the liquidity policy of the European Central Bank during the Euro crisis, sovereign pensions and social security reserve funds. Lending, Investments and the Financial Crisis addresses the ways in which the strategies of institutional investors have been impacted by the crisis. The study focuses on Western, Central and Eastern Europe, while providing a wider context in terms of comparison with the Chinese banking system.\r\n\r\n---\r\n <a href=\"\nhttp://dlfeb.com/book/lending-investments-and-financial-crisis-palgrave-macmillan-studies-in-banking-and-financial-institutions/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttp://dlfeb.com/book/lending-investments-and-financial-crisis-palgrave-macmillan-studies-in-banking-and-financial-institutions/</a>","last_updated":"2017-07-29T12:00:40.444Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce4eb50baf99327268cb9bee92da7faf6b1d8c0b","dn":"LENDING, INVESTMENTS AND THE FINANCIAL CRISIS","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"ce4eb50baf99327268cb9bee92da7faf6b1d8c0b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,78,181,11,175,153,50,114,104,203,155,238,146,218,127,175,107,29,140,11]},"name":"LENDING, INVESTMENTS AND THE FINANCIAL CRISIS","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
