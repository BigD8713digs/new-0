Without Aunt Magnolia, Jane is directionless. Then an old acquaintance, the glamorous and capricious Kiran Thrash, blows back into Jane&#x2019;s life and invites her to a gala at the Thrashes&#x2019; extravagant island mansion called Tu Reviens. Jane remembers her aunt telling her: &#x201C;If anyone ever invites you to Tu Reviens, promise me that you&#x2019;ll go.&#x201D;\r\n\r\nWhat Jane doesn&#x2019;t know is that at Tu Reviens her story will change; the house will offer her five choices that could ultimately determine the course of her untethered life. But every choice comes with a price. She might fall in love, she might lose her life, she might come face-to-face with herself. At Tu Reviens, anything is possible","last_updated":"2017-11-19T12:07:51.137Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:b727911c570e0ff98ef2a8a9d2f9a59b608db6dc","dn":"Kristin Cashore - Jane Unlimited (epub)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"b727911c570e0ff98ef2a8a9d2f9a59b608db6dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,39,145,28,87,14,15,249,142,242,168,169,210,249,165,155,96,141,182,220]},"name":"Kristin Cashore - Jane Unlimited (epub)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
