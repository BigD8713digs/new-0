Now he runs with the bulls in Pamplona, battles Kiefer Sutherland in Jenga, and crashes million-dollar weddings. How did he do it? The E.P.I.C. Model of Adventure, a breakthrough four-step process (Establish, Push Boundaries, Increase, Continue) for building the perfect adventure, from picking the right team to choosing the right mission and taking the right risks - with plenty of stories from his own exploits to show you how it&apos;s done. With the mold-breaking brilliance of Timothy Ferriss&apos; The 4-Hour Work Week and the geeky enthusiasm of a TED Talk, this book is your ticket to the next level. You&apos;ll learn plenty, but the first lesson is easy: nothing good happens after 2 a.m. - except the most EPIC experiences of our lives.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-10-22T12:01:44.917Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:90b6a8d6026898249f35147ef38310d9b6250e39","dn":"The 2 AM Principle by Jon Levy AZW3","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"90b6a8d6026898249f35147ef38310d9b6250e39","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,182,168,214,2,104,152,36,159,53,20,126,243,131,16,217,182,37,14,57]},"name":"The 2 AM Principle by Jon Levy AZW3","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
