The codebreakers at Bletchley Park, the most successful World War II intelligence agency, were completely unaware that their predecessors in earlier moments of national crisis had broken the codes of Napoleon during the Napoleonic wars and those of Spain before the Spanish Armada.\r\n\r\nThose who do not understand past mistakes are likely to repeat them. Intelligence is a prime example. At the outbreak of World War I, the grasp of intelligence shown by U.S. President Woodrow Wilson and British Prime Minister Herbert Asquith was not in the same class as that of George Washington during the Revolutionary War and leading eighteenth-century British statesmen.\r\n\r\nIn this book, the first global history of espionage ever written, distinguished historian Christopher Andrew recovers much of the lost intelligence history of the past three millennia&#x2014;and shows us its relevance.\r\n\r\nGenre: Non-Fiction &gt; General","last_updated":"2018-09-22T12:18:52.828Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:7cc25ad98546852eea28a286aab24370e00aacb4","dn":"The Secret World by Christopher Andrew (.epub)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"7cc25ad98546852eea28a286aab24370e00aacb4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,194,90,217,133,70,133,46,234,40,162,134,170,178,67,112,224,10,172,180]},"name":"The Secret World by Christopher Andrew (.epub)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
