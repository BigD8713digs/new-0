And according to the residents of the Japanese village with the world&apos;s longest-living people, finding it is the key to a happier and longer life. Having a strong sense of ikigai - the place where passion, mission, vocation, and profession intersect - means that each day is infused with meaning. It&apos;s the reason we get up in the morning. It&apos;s also the reason many Japanese never really retire (in fact there&apos;s no word in Japanese that means retire in the sense it does in English): They remain active and work at what they enjoy, because they&apos;ve found a real purpose in life - the happiness of always being busy. In researching this book, the authors interviewed the residents of the Japanese village with the highest percentage of 100-year-olds - one of the world&apos;s Blue Zones. Ikigai reveals the secrets to their longevity and happiness: how they eat, how they move, how they work, how they foster collaboration and community, and - their best-kept secret - how they find the ikigai that brings satisfaction to their lives. And it provides practical tools to help you discover your own ikigai. Because who doesn&apos;t want to find happiness in every day?\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-09-02T12:01:08.209Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:f1302fc66ca506c3ebd45f70fe76fb2b07f44507","dn":"Ikigai_ The Japanese Secret to a Long and Happy Life by Hector G","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"f1302fc66ca506c3ebd45f70fe76fb2b07f44507","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,48,47,198,108,165,6,195,235,212,95,112,254,118,251,43,7,244,69,7]},"name":"Ikigai_ The Japanese Secret to a Long and Happy Life by Hector G","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
