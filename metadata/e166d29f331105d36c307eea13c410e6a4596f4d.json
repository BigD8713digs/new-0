Walsh, Becoming Bonnie is the untold story of how wholesome Bonnelyn Parker became half of the infamous Bonnie and Clyde duo!\r\n\r\nThe summer of 1927 might be the height of the Roaring &apos;20s, but Bonnelyn Parker is more likely to belt out a church hymn than sling drinks at an illicit juice joint. She&apos;s a sharp girl with plans to overcome her family&apos;s poverty, provide for herself, and maybe someday marry her boyfriend, Roy Thornton. But when Roy springs a proposal on her and financial woes jeopardize her ambitions, Bonnelyn finds salvation in an unlikely place: Dallas&apos; newest speakeasy, Doc&apos;s.\r\n\r\nLiving the life of a moll at night, Bonnie remains a wholesome girl by day, engaged to Roy, attending school, and working toward a steady future. When Roy discovers her secret life, he embraces it - perhaps too much, especially when it comes to booze and gambling - and she tries to make the pieces fit. Maybe she can have it all: the American dream, the husband, and the intoxicating allure of jazz music. But her life - like her country - is headed for a crash.\r\n\r\nBonnie Parker is about to meet Clyde Barrow.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-09-16T12:01:31.881Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:e166d29f331105d36c307eea13c410e6a4596f4d","dn":"Becoming Bonnie_ A Novel by Jenni Walsh ePUB eBOOK-ZAK","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"e166d29f331105d36c307eea13c410e6a4596f4d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,102,210,159,51,17,5,211,108,48,126,234,19,196,16,230,164,89,111,77]},"name":"Becoming Bonnie_ A Novel by Jenni Walsh ePUB eBOOK-ZAK","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
