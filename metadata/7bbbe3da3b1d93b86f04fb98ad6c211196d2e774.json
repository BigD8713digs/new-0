Pairing the hazy, pedalboard-fueled sonic might of Slowdive and My Bloody Valentine and the laconic gait of Pavement with the sugary aura of Alvvays, the quartet has crafted a compelling set that plays fast and loose with expectations. Anchored by the sweet/salty croon of vocalist Karli Helm, early standouts like &#x201C;Elliot,&#x201D; &#x201C;Ortega,&#x201D; and &#x201C;Fallout&#x201D; evoke humid summer afternoons mired in the sad wonder of youth; broken hearts developing their first calluses and teetering on the the cusp of nostalgia. While dream pop is hardly provincial, there&#x2019;s a surfy, West Coast vibe supplying much of the album&#x2019;s current, with the laid-back &#x201C;Restart&#x201D; and the quietly soaring &#x201C;Shannon,&#x201D; the latter of which features Helm&#x2019;s most powerful and vulnerable vocal take, leading the push out into the waves. Elsewhere, the combustive and hook-laden &#x201C;Stuck to You&#x201D; suggests formative years spent dancing around the room to the Breeders&#x2019; Last Splash, while the dreamy closer, &#x201C;Blue Room,&#x201D; skillfully pairs the overcast longing of Mazzy Star with the controlled atmospherics of Beach House. \r\nIn blending shadowy, fuzzed-out cinematics with pop acumen, Pllush have developed a distinct voice with familiar overtones, and Stranger to the Pain succeeds because it never panders to either predilection. \r\n\r\nTracklist: \r\n01 - Elliot.flac \r\n02 - Syrup.flac \r\n03 - Ortega.flac \r\n04 - Big Train.flac \r\n05 - Fallout.flac \r\n06 - 3;45.flac \r\n07 - Restart.flac \r\n08 - Sleeper Cab.flac \r\n09 - Stuck to You.flac \r\n10 - Okay.flac \r\n11 - Shannon.flac \r\n12 - Blue Room.flac \r\n\r\nSummary: \r\nCountry: USA \r\nGenre: dream-pop, shoegaze","last_updated":"2018-06-14T12:02:57.615Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:7bbbe3da3b1d93b86f04fb98ad6c211196d2e774","dn":"[dream-pop, shoegaze] (2018) Pllush - Stranger to the Pain [FLAC","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"7bbbe3da3b1d93b86f04fb98ad6c211196d2e774","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,187,227,218,59,29,147,184,111,4,251,152,173,108,33,17,150,210,231,116]},"name":"[dream-pop, shoegaze] (2018) Pllush - Stranger to the Pain [FLAC","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
