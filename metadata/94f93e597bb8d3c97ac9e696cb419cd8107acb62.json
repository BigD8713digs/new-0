But post-grad wasn&apos;t the glam life she imagined. Soon buried under a pile of bills, laundry, and three-dollar bottles of wine, it quickly became clear that she had no idea what she was doing. But hey, what twentysomething does?\r\n\r\nIn Don&apos;t Worry, It Gets Worse, Nugent shares what it takes to make the awkward leap from undergrad to &quot;mature and responsible adult that definitely never eats peanut butter straight from the jar and considers it a meal&quot;. From trying to find an apartment on the black hole otherwise known as Craigslist to the creative maneuvering needed to pay off student loans and still enjoy happy hour, Nugent documents the formative moments of being a twentysomething with a little bit of snark and a lot of heart. Perfect for fans of HBO&apos;s Girls and Allie Brosh&apos;s Hyperbole and a Half, and based on her popular Tumblr blog The Frenemy, Don&apos;t Worry, It Gets Worse is a love note to boozin&apos;, bitchin&apos; ladies everywhere.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-12-10T12:06:47.074Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:94f93e597bb8d3c97ac9e696cb419cd8107acb62","dn":"Don't Worry, It Gets Worse by Alida Nugent EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"94f93e597bb8d3c97ac9e696cb419cd8107acb62","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,249,62,89,123,184,211,201,122,201,230,150,203,65,156,216,16,122,203,98]},"name":"Don't Worry, It Gets Worse by Alida Nugent EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
