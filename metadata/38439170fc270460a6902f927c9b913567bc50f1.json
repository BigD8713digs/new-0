A single woman had no defense against Russian soldiers who raped as a form of revenge, nor against plundering Poles who found themselves in desperate straits. The law of the jungle had replaced the rule of law. Help arrives for Rose in the form of Tadeusz, a former officer in the Polish Home Army who survived the Warsaw uprising and is attempting to hide his identity. \r\n\r\nGreek and English subtitle files included.\r\n\r\nBRrip","last_updated":"2017-07-18T12:02:10.370Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:38439170fc270460a6902f927c9b913567bc50f1","dn":"Rose aka Roza (2011) SUBS ENG   GREEK SRT","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"38439170fc270460a6902f927c9b913567bc50f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,67,145,112,252,39,4,96,166,144,47,146,124,155,145,53,103,188,80,241]},"name":"Rose aka Roza (2011) SUBS ENG   GREEK SRT","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
