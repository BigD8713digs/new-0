That&#x2019;s the\r\n\r\n critical question facing Odd Thomas, the young man with a unique ability to commune\r\n\r\n with restless spirits and help them find justice and peace. But this time, it&#x2019;s the\r\n\r\n living who desperately need Odd on their side. Three helpless innocents will be\r\n\r\n brutally executed unless Odd can intervene in time. Who the potential victims are\r\n\r\n and where they can be found remain a mystery. The only thing Odd knows for sure is\r\n\r\n who the killer will be: the homicidal stranger who tried to shoot him dead in a\r\n\r\n small-town parking lot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  runtime pt. 1  4:31:09\r\n\r\n  runtime pt. 2  5:04:59","last_updated":"2017-09-02T12:03:13.455Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:b169cb418d975cf73b25cda69a9929fa43fe1fef","dn":"Deeply Odd - Dean Koontz - 2 parts","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"b169cb418d975cf73b25cda69a9929fa43fe1fef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,105,203,65,141,151,92,247,59,37,205,166,154,153,41,250,67,254,31,239]},"name":"Deeply Odd - Dean Koontz - 2 parts","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
