When Grady tries to save a drunk from two thugs, Coop tags along for the sake of a good story. The drunk is Ebbie Milch, a small-time thief on the run in Mexico because he has stolen the never-before-seen first draft of Ernest Hemingway&apos;s A Moveable Feast from a wealthy rare-book dealer.\r\n\r\nThe stolen manuscript is more than just a rare piece of literary history. It reveals clues to an even bigger prize: the location of a suitcase the young, unpublished Hemingway lost in Paris in 1922. A year&apos;s worth of his stories had vanished, never to be seen again. Until now.\r\n\r\nBut Coop and Grady aren&apos;t the only ones with their eyes on this elusive literary prize, and what starts as a hunt for a legendary writer&apos;s lost works becomes a deadly adventure. For Coop this story could become the book of a lifetime...if he lives long enough to write it.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-12-26T12:05:10.601Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:7062ccaf370d056e5c079b554b5a9d863a797113","dn":"The Hemingway Thief by Shaun Harris EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"7062ccaf370d056e5c079b554b5a9d863a797113","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,98,204,175,55,13,5,110,92,7,155,85,75,90,157,134,58,121,113,19]},"name":"The Hemingway Thief by Shaun Harris EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
