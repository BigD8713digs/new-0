No reference to the present day is intended or should be inferred. The sizable cast of characters includes anarchists, balloonists, gamblers, corporate tycoons, drug enthusiasts, innocents and decadents, mathematicians, mad scientists, shamans, psychics, and stage magicians, spies, detectives, adventuresses, and hired guns. There are cameo appearances by Nikola Tesla, Bela Lugosi, and Groucho Marx.\r\n\r\nAs an era of certainty comes crashing down around their ears and an unpredictable future commences, these folks are mostly just trying to pursue their lives. Sometimes they manage to catch up; sometimes it&apos;s their lives that pursue them.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the author is up to his usual business. Characters stop what they&apos;re doing to sing what are for the most part stupid songs. Strange sexual practices take place. Obscure languages are spoken, not always idiomatically. Contrary-to-the-fact occurrences occur. If it is not the world, it is what the world might be with a minor adjustment or two. According to some, this is one of the main purposes of fiction.\r\n\r\nLet the reader decide, let the reader beware. Good luck.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-07-20T12:00:56.311Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f0c13bb9ee535ab1b0359b6e8a6def8675b90ff","dn":"Against the Day by Thomas Pynchon epub RtR","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"4f0c13bb9ee535ab1b0359b6e8a6def8675b90ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,12,19,187,158,229,53,171,27,3,89,182,232,166,222,248,103,91,144,255]},"name":"Against the Day by Thomas Pynchon epub RtR","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
