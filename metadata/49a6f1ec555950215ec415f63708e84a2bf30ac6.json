In addition to the standard editing features, it supports 16 bits per channel, CMYK and Lab as well as color management with ICC profiles. The include image browser supports IPTC and EXIF data display and editing, batch conversion, HTML gallery output, batch renaming and more.\r\n\r\nProfessional image processing - In spite of its low price PhotoLine 32 offers every function needed for professional image processing: 16 bit per color channel; CMYK and Lab color space; Color management with ICC profiles. Lossless image processing - Lossless image processing is made possible by adding functions to an image without changing the original data. This way we loose no information and have access to the unmodified image data every time we want to.\r\n\r\nPhotoLine offers every function for working with digital photos, such as: PhotoLine can import the raw image data - the so-called raw-files - of nearly every digital camera. In addition, PhotoLine 32 offers many functions for enhancing photos: Light/Shadow adjusts brightness errors. Connect Images can be used to combine two differently exposed photos to a single better one. White Point corrects the white point of an image automatically or manually. The Color Temperature can be set or adjusted. Chromatic Aberration corrects color distortions at edges. Image Noise reduces the color and brightness noise in an image. Red Eyes removes red pupils caused by the flash of the camera. Lenses Correction corrects the distortions caused by the curvature of the lenses. Perspective distortions can easily be fixed by using the layer tool or the rectangular lasso.\r\n\r\nPhotoLine can save documents as PDF. On doing that text and vector graphic is - if possible - not reduced to pixel graphics. On saving optionally all color information in a document can be converted to CMYK. PhotoLine can also import PDF files. The import keeps the structure of the document intact, this means, text is read as text layers and vector graphics is read as vector layers. PhotoLine is able to work with documents containing more than one page. This allows the creation of booklets and flyers. In contrast to classic image processing PhotoLine can create empty pages (pages without a background image) which can be used to place images, text and vector graphics","last_updated":"2018-07-11T12:02:34.127Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:49a6f1ec555950215ec415f63708e84a2bf30ac6","dn":"PhotoLine 21.00 Multilingual Cracked","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"49a6f1ec555950215ec415f63708e84a2bf30ac6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,166,241,236,85,89,80,33,94,196,21,246,55,8,232,74,43,243,10,198]},"name":"PhotoLine 21.00 Multilingual Cracked","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
