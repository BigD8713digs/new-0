The direct current (DC) machine and the alternatingcurrent (AC) machines (induction, PM synchronous, and BLDC) are allcovered in detail. The author emphasizes control techniques usedfor high-performance applications, specifically ones that requireboth rapid and precise control of position, speed, or torque.You&#x2019;ll discover how to derive mathematical models of the machines,and how the resulting models can be used to design controlalgorithms that achieve high performance. Graduate studentsstudying power and control as well as practicing engineers inindustry will find this a highly readable text on the operation,modeling, and control of electric machines.\r\n\r\nAn Instructor&#x2019;s Manual presenting detailed solutions to all theproblems in the book is available from the Wiley editorialdepartment","last_updated":"2018-08-16T12:02:39.141Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b88303ffc34e8c440e93fad6124fa500a17c36d","dn":"Modeling And High Performance Control Of Electrical Machines","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"6b88303ffc34e8c440e93fad6124fa500a17c36d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,136,48,63,252,52,232,196,64,233,63,173,97,36,250,80,10,23,195,109]},"name":"Modeling And High Performance Control Of Electrical Machines","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
