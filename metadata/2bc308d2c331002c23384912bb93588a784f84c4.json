He is loved across the nation for his delight in the peculiar and for his ability to find humour and a common ground in all that life brings. \r\n\r\nThe Life and Loves of a He Devil is Graham&apos;s funny and honest memoir on the theme of love. As he shows, it&apos;s really the things you love that make you who you are and so Graham tells his story from his Irish childhood to the present day, describing just what and who he loved - and sometimes lost - as a young boy, and his new loves and obsessions - big and small - as he&apos;s grown older. It&apos;s been 10 years since his last book and being a decade older Graham has come to realise that what makes a life interesting is less what happens to you and more what inspires and drives you, what you love.... From Dolly Parton and dogs to wine and Ireland, Graham tells of his life and loves with characteristic humour and outrageous candour. \r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-09-08T12:27:55.207Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:2bc308d2c331002c23384912bb93588a784f84c4","dn":"The Life and Loves of a He Devil by Graham Norton EPUB ","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"2bc308d2c331002c23384912bb93588a784f84c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,195,8,210,195,49,0,44,35,56,73,18,187,147,88,138,120,79,132,196]},"name":"The Life and Loves of a He Devil by Graham Norton EPUB ","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
