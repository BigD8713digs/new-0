On the one hand, we struggle to survive on our own in the wild, often failing to overcome even basic challenges, like obtaining food, building shelters, or avoiding predators. On the other hand, human groups have produced ingenious technologies, sophisticated languages, and complex institutions that have permitted us to successfully expand into a vast range of diverse environments.\r\n\r\nWhat has enabled us to dominate the globe, more than any other species, while remaining virtually helpless as lone individuals? This book shows that the secret of our success lies not in our innate intelligence, but in our collective brains - on the ability of human groups to socially interconnect and learn from one another over generations.\r\n\r\nDrawing insights from lost European explorers, clever chimpanzees, mobile hunter-gatherers, neuroscientific findings, ancient bones, and the human genome, Joseph Henrich demonstrates how our collective brains have propelled our species&apos; genetic evolution and shaped our biology.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-03-19T12:00:38.327Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:9355b663194ec8a562884f472db6870d66a357d6","dn":"The Secret of Our Success by Joseph Henrich AZW","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"9355b663194ec8a562884f472db6870d66a357d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,85,182,99,25,78,200,165,98,136,79,71,45,182,135,13,102,163,87,214]},"name":"The Secret of Our Success by Joseph Henrich AZW","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
