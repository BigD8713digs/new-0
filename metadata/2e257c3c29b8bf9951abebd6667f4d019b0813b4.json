In stories of the past that careen from Ethel Merman on Broadway to John Belushi on his last night on earth, to fantastic tales of the present, including a showdown on horseback on Steven Spielberg&apos;s driveway, two somewhat reluctant icons form a memorable bond, and a remarkable read.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-08-13T12:00:52.157Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e257c3c29b8bf9951abebd6667f4d019b0813b4","dn":"The Masked Man_ A Memoir And Fantasy Of Hollywood by Tom Wilson ","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"2e257c3c29b8bf9951abebd6667f4d019b0813b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,37,124,60,41,184,191,153,81,171,235,214,102,127,77,1,155,8,19,180]},"name":"The Masked Man_ A Memoir And Fantasy Of Hollywood by Tom Wilson ","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
