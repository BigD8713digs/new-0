Those months saw the end of ninety years of the British Raj, and the effective power of the Maharajahs, as the Congress Party established itself commanding a democratic government in Delhi. They also witnessed the rushed creation of Pakistan as a country in two halves whose capitals were two thousand kilometers apart.\r\n\r\nFrom September to December 1947 the euphoria surrounding the realization of the dream of independence dissipated into shame and incrimination; nearly 1 million people died and countless more lost their homes and their livelihoods as partition was realized. The events of those months would dictate the history of South Asia for the next seventy years, leading to three wars, countless acts of terrorism, polarization around the Cold War powers and to two nations with millions living in poverty spending disproportionate amounts on their military. The roots of much of the violence in the region today, and worldwide, are in the decisions taken that year.\r\n\r\nAbout the Author\r\nEducated at Eton College and the University of St Andrews, Barney White-Spunner was commissioned in 1979. He was appointed Commanding Officer of the Household Cavalry in 1996 and became Chief of Joint Force Operations for the national contingent in the Middle East in 2003. He was made Commander of the British Field Army in 2009, which post he held until December 2011 when he retired. He was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 2002 and Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) in the 2011 Birthday Honours. He began his literary career writing for The Field in 1992 and became editor of Baily&apos;s Hunting Directory in 1994.
