Tell Me You&apos;re Mine is a story of guilt, grief, and the delicate balance between love and obsession. \r\n\r\nWhere is the line between hope and madness? \r\n\r\nThree women: one who believes she has found her long lost daughter, one terrified she&apos;s about to lose her child, and one determined to understand who she truly is. \r\n\r\nStella Widstrand is a psychotherapist, a happily married mother to a 13-year-old son. But when a young woman named Isabelle steps into her clinic to begin therapy, Stella&apos;s placid life begins to crumble. She is convinced that Isabelle is her daughter, Alice: the baby that tragically disappeared more than 20 years ago on a beach during a family vacation. Alice is believed to have drowned, but her body was never found. Stella has always believed that Alice is alive, somewhere - but everyone around her worries she&apos;s delusional. Could this be Alice? \r\n\r\nStella will risk everything to answer that question, but in doing so she will set in motion a sequence of events beyond her control, endangering herself and everyone she loves. \r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-09-11T12:20:10.746Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:c1a1bec3335522ede27cea03e12785dfc1473e75","dn":"Tell Me You're Mine by Elisabeth Noreb&auml;ck EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"c1a1bec3335522ede27cea03e12785dfc1473e75","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,161,190,195,51,85,34,237,226,124,234,3,225,39,133,223,193,71,62,117]},"name":"Tell Me You're Mine by Elisabeth Noreb&auml;ck EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
