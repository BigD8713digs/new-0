Some copies include a bonus disc featuring four additional songs. An accompanying DVD with the same title was also released the same year. The album&apos;s title derives from a lyric from their song &quot;Missing,&quot; off 1994&apos;s Amplified Heart. While all videos could be described as &quot;stylish&quot;--much like Everything But the Girl--they&apos;re otherwise quite different. Sometimes Tracey Thorne and Ben Watt appear; other times actors take center stage. &quot;Single,&quot; for instance, features a man tumbling across town: down the street, into a Laundromat, in and out of a dryer, etc. Then there&apos;s the &quot;populist&quot; video for Simon and Garfunkel?s &quot;The Only Living Boy in New York,&quot; directed by art house favorite Hal Hartley (Henry Fool). (The duo appears to have added a few dozen members.) The DVD also includes three live performances, including a fine version of Massive Attack&apos;s &quot;Protection&quot; (featuring Thorne on vocals), and three demo tracks that play as photos of the duo pass by.\r\n\r\nYear of manufacture: 2002\r\nCountry: UK\r\nGenre: Pop\r\nDuration: 1:05:45\r\nLabel: Virgin\r\nQuality: DVD9\r\nFormat: DVD Video\r\nVideo codec: MPEG2\r\nAudio Codec: AC3\r\nVideo: 9800 Kbps, 25.0 fps, resolution 720 * 576 (4: 3)\r\nAudio: AC3, 2 / 0ch, 448Kbps\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\nVideo:\r\n1.Missing Todd Terry remix.\r\n2.Single\r\n3.The only living boy in New York\r\n4.Temperamental\r\n5.Love is here where I live\r\n6.Five fathoms\r\n7.Each and every one\r\n8.Driving\r\n9.Walking wounded\r\nLive At The Forum, London, November 1999:\r\n10.Before today 6:03\r\n11.Temperamental 5:52\r\n12.Protection 7:16\r\nDemos / Photo Gallery:\r\n13 Frozen River 3:32\r\n14 Mirrorball 3:26\r\n15  Flipside 4:16\r\nInteractive Video Mix / Exclusive Remix:\r\n16 Temperamental (Pull&apos;s Timewarp Mix) 6:25\r\n <a href=\"\nhttps://s15.postimg.cc/44mv7583v/Cover.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://s15.postimg.cc/44mv7583v/Cover.jpg</a>","last_updated":"2018-06-06T12:08:44.131Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:a12ea5e89b9e6cd763d35b0c5e3fc9c5b8a6bd47","dn":"Everything But the Girl - Like the Deserts Miss the Rain [2002] ","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"a12ea5e89b9e6cd763d35b0c5e3fc9c5b8a6bd47","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,46,165,232,155,158,108,215,99,211,91,12,94,63,201,197,184,166,189,71]},"name":"Everything But the Girl - Like the Deserts Miss the Rain [2002] ","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
