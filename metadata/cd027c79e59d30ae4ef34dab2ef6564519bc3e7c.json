But on April 22, 1943, the war took a terrible turn for them. While on patrol deep in enemy waters, their submarine, the USS Grenadier, was torpedoed and sent crashing to the ocean floor. Listed as lost in action and given up for dead, all four had in fact miraculously escaped the ship, only to be captured by the Japanese. The four men spent the next two and a half years as POWs, enduring barbaric torture and starvation, unable to communicate with their wives and families. When they were freed, they were forced to find a new kind of resilience as they struggled to resume their lives in a world that seemed to have forgotten them.\r\n\r\nIn Bob&#x2019;s case, it would be more than 30 years before he was reunited with the love of his life - the wife who had left him for a well-bred naval officer after he came back from the war.\r\n\r\nBy turns panoramic and intimate, No Ordinary Joes shows us, through the lives of four &quot;ordinary&quot; men who endured extraordinary circumstances, the tragedy of war and its aftermath, and the restorative power of love.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-01-27T12:04:54.690Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd027c79e59d30ae4ef34dab2ef6564519bc3e7c","dn":"No Ordinary Joes by Larry Colton EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"cd027c79e59d30ae4ef34dab2ef6564519bc3e7c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,2,124,121,229,157,48,174,78,243,77,171,46,246,86,69,25,188,62,124]},"name":"No Ordinary Joes by Larry Colton EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
