From there, on to classic Thai staples such as Pad Thai Fried Noodles, Thai Stir Fry Beef and Coconut Fish Curry - authentic dishes that are the go-to recipes for Thai food fanatics who love delicious, healthy food that is easy to cook and impressive to serve.\r\nThe myth of Thai cooking is that its exotic secrets are hard to master, out of reach for the everyday cook. We instead settle for cheap takeaway which is usually disappointing. Cooking really good authentic Thai food is actually relatively simple. There is a bit of prep to do but the cooking process is not that hard. What is vital is to get a balance of taste, so hot, sweet, salt and sour are in balance. Let Tom Kime show you how.\r\n\r\nAbout the Author\r\nAs a chef and food consultant Tom brings a fresh eye and experienced world view to his recipes. His contemporary method of balancing taste and flavour is quite unique, resulting in vibrant three-dimensional food that excites the palate with every mouthful. Tom cut his catering teeth in some of the most famous restaurants in London and Sydney. He has travelled to 42 countries to sample, discover and understand how to cook the world&apos;s best street food. He worked at Le Pont de la Tour in London and then with Rick Stein at The Seafood restaurant in Cornwall. Tom worked at the River Cafe alongside Jamie Oliver (he cooked the food at Jamie&apos;s wedding) and at Darley St Thai with David Thompson and Cicada with Peter Doyle in Sydney. Tom is the Group Executive Chef of Goodtime hospitality at East Village Sydney and at the West village in Petersham, Sydney. \r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\nIntroduction\r\nIngredients for Thai cooking\r\n15 must-have herbs &amp; spices\r\nSnacks &amp; finger food\r\nSalads\r\nSlow roast, smoking grill &amp; hot wok\r\nFish &amp; seafood\r\nCurries &amp; soups\r\nRice, noodles &amp; sides\r\nDesserts &amp; drinks\r\nBasics\r\nMenu planner\r\nIndex\r\nCopyright\r\n <a href=\"\nhttps://s2.postimg.org/hpyt2tuxl/Thai_Food_Made_Easy.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://s2.postimg.org/hpyt2tuxl/Thai_Food_Made_Easy.jpg</a>","last_updated":"2017-08-27T12:08:16.613Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:6fbfdf766f7dd4847c067b858ebb162806a8cb85","dn":"Thai Food Made Easy (gnv64)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"6fbfdf766f7dd4847c067b858ebb162806a8cb85","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,191,223,118,111,125,212,132,124,6,123,133,142,187,22,40,6,168,203,133]},"name":"Thai Food Made Easy (gnv64)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
