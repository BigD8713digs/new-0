A reviled figure in Islamic history, often portrayed as the very epitome of brutality, Reynald remains as controversial - and as vividly present in the minds of many in the Middle East - as the story of the Crusades themselves. An epic saga set in the midst of a violent clash of civilizations, God&apos;s Wolf tells the story of Reynald&apos;s staggering rise from lowly soldier to prince of Antioch, one of the crusader kingdoms in the Near East. Jeffrey Lee argues that, despite his brutality, Reynald was a strong military leader and an effective statesman who defended his kingdom against attacks from Byzantines, Armenians, and Muslims. A tale of faith, fanaticism, and brutality, God&apos;s Wolf is the fascinating story of an exceptional Crusader and a provocative reinterpretation of the Crusader era.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-08-20T12:00:23.173Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:5fb0aa3c1e35741ec401b338cc7f67d0f67a1703","dn":"God's Wolf_ The Life of the Most Notorious of All Crusaders, Sco","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"5fb0aa3c1e35741ec401b338cc7f67d0f67a1703","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,176,170,60,30,53,116,30,196,1,179,56,204,127,103,208,246,122,23,3]},"name":"God's Wolf_ The Life of the Most Notorious of All Crusaders, Sco","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
