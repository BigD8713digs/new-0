Markey, Christopher J. Ferguson EPUB\r\n\r\nThe media and politicians have been sounding the alarm for years, and with every fresh tragedy involving a young perpetrator comes another flurry of articles about the dangers of violent media. The problem is this: Their fear isn&apos;t supported by the evidence. In fact, unlike the video game-trained murder machines depicted in the press, school shooters are actually less likely to be interested in violent games than their peers. In reality, most well-adjusted children and teenagers play violent video games, all without ever exhibiting violent behavior in real life. What&apos;s more, spikes in sales of violent games actually correspond to decreased rates of violent crime.\r\n\r\nIf that surprises you, you&apos;re not alone - the national dialogue on games and violence has been hopelessly biased. But that&apos;s beginning to change. Scholars are finding that not only are violent games not one of society&apos;s great evils, they may even be a force for good.\r\n\r\nIn Moral Combat, Markey and Ferguson explore how video games - even the bloodiest - can have a positive impact on everything from social skills to stress, and may even make us more morally sensitive.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-03-29T12:09:32.839Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:ebba5d88b5d0128089df19c4510b383a1d5bd829","dn":"Moral Combat by Patrick M.
