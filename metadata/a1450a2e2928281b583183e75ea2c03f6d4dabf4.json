It is by far the most ubiquitous and accessible mature web language, and welcomes thousands of new developers every day. It is this ease of access that can, admittedly, sometimes give it a bad name - good resources are few and far in between, and the competition is real, driving people to take shortcuts, skip best practices, and learn on-the-fly.\r\n\r\nWith PHP 7+ came some improvements that make it harder to make mistakes, and 7.2 is making things even safer, even more structured. If you&apos;re just getting started with the language (or perhaps youve been using it a while and have learned some bad habits), you&apos;re in luck. Not only will it be ever harder to slip up and make mistakes, but content such as this - hand picked from the excellent SitePoint PHP channel - will help you get started the right way.\r\n\r\nThis collection comprises:\r\n\r\nHow PHP Executes - from Source Code to Render by Thomas Punt\r\nGetting to Know and Love Xdebug by Bruno ?...? kvorc\r\nLocalization Demystified: Php-Intl for Everyone by Younes Rafie\r\nEvent Sourcing in a Pinch by Christopher Pitt\r\nDisco with Design Patterns: A Fresh Look at Dependency Injection by Reza Lavaryan\r\nA Comprehensive Guide to Using Cronjobs by Reza Lavaryan\r\nEvent Loops in PHP by Christopher Pitt\r\nPDO - the Right Way to Access Databases in PHP by Parham Doustdar\r\nVagrant: The Right Way to Start with PHP by Bruno ?...? kvorc\r\n\r\nThis book is suitable for beginner- to intermediate-level PHP developers","last_updated":"2017-08-26T12:00:38.612Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1450a2e2928281b583183e75ea2c03f6d4dabf4","dn":"Better PHP Development(2017) - PDF - zeke23","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"a1450a2e2928281b583183e75ea2c03f6d4dabf4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,69,10,46,41,40,40,27,88,49,131,231,94,162,192,63,109,77,171,244]},"name":"Better PHP Development(2017) - PDF - zeke23","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
