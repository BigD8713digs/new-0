Luce argues that we are on a menacing trajectory brought about by ignorance of what it took to build the West, arrogance towards society&apos;s economic losers, and complacency about our system&apos;s durability - attitudes that have been emerging since the fall of the Berlin Wall. We cannot move forward without a clear diagnosis of what has gone wrong.\r\n\r\nCombining on-the-ground reporting with intelligent synthesis of the literature and economic analysis, Luce offers a detailed projection of the consequences of the Trump administration, the rise of European populism, and a forward-thinking analysis of what those who believe in enlightenment values must do to defend them from the multiple onslaughts they face in the coming years.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-08-07T12:00:25.267Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:22352add87dbe2a725ec1f05298a9efdc2bb6978","dn":"The Retreat of Western Liberalism by Edward Luce ePUB eBOOK-ZAK","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"22352add87dbe2a725ec1f05298a9efdc2bb6978","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,53,42,221,135,219,226,167,37,236,31,5,41,138,158,253,194,187,105,120]},"name":"The Retreat of Western Liberalism by Edward Luce ePUB eBOOK-ZAK","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
