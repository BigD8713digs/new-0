Few frontmen can claim to have had such a lengthy and far-reaching career as Graham Bonnet. He found what was possibly his greatest success replacing Ronnie James Dio in Ritchie Blackmore&apos;s Rainbow for 1979&apos;s Down To Earth. He formed Alcatrazz with a formidable, but relatively young 20 year old Swedish guitarist named Yngwie Malmsteen. Bonnet and Malmsteen formed an impressive songwriting partnership, with songs such as &apos;Island In The Sun&apos; and &apos;Hiroshima Mon Amour&apos; on the band&apos;s debut offering, No Parole From Rock &apos;N&apos; Roll. &apos;Jet To Jet&apos;, &apos;Kree Nakoorie&apos;, &apos;Too Young To Die, Too Drunk To Live&apos;, &apos;Starcarr Lane&apos; and &apos;Suffer Me&apos; are also included. When Yngwie left in 1984 to pursue a successful career as a solo artist fronting his own Rising Force, Alcatrazz not only lost a key songwriter, but also a musician who would turn out to be one of the most influential lead guitarists of the decade and beyond. Although a relative unknown at the time, it was a stroke of genius when future David Lee Roth and Whitesnake guitarist Steve Vai joined the band. Signing to EMI&apos;s US subsidiary Capitol Records, Disturbing the Peace was released in 1985","last_updated":"2018-03-27T12:10:41.735Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:3695026d55ea4158487fef4cc1f441c949fe1b45","dn":"Alcatrazz - Breaking The Heart Of  City: The Best(1983-1986)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"3695026d55ea4158487fef4cc1f441c949fe1b45","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,149,2,109,85,234,65,88,72,127,239,76,193,244,65,201,73,254,27,69]},"name":"Alcatrazz - Breaking The Heart Of  City: The Best(1983-1986)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
