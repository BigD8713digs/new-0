But not everyone aboard shares such noble ideals.\r\n\r\nBootlegging, booze, and prostitution form a lucrative underground economy for rival gangs, which the authorities are happy to turn a blind eye to until a disassembled corpse is found dancing in the microgravity.\r\n\r\nIn charge of the murder investigation is Nikki &quot;Fix&quot; Freeman, who is not thrilled to have Alice Blake, an uptight government Goody-Two-shoes, riding shotgun. As the bodies pile up and the partners are forced to question their own memories, Nikki and Alice begin to realize that gang warfare may not be the only cause for the violence.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-11-13T12:01:00.100Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:d876aa53ae12316f7cf32199fc33f6c15395c5c2","dn":"Places in the Darkness by Chris Brookmyre EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"d876aa53ae12316f7cf32199fc33f6c15395c5c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,118,170,83,174,18,49,111,124,243,33,153,252,51,246,193,83,149,197,194]},"name":"Places in the Darkness by Chris Brookmyre EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
