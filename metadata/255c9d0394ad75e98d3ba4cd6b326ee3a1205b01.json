But there&apos;s something he&apos;s not prepared for - a blue envelope with his name scrawled across the front in Natalie&apos;s handwriting, waiting for him on the floor of their suburban Michigan home.\r\n\r\nThe letter inside, written on the first day of Natalie&apos;s cancer treatment a year ago, turns out to be the first of many. Luke is convinced they&apos;re genuine, but who is delivering them? As his obsession with the letters grows, Luke uncovers long-buried secrets that make him question everything he knew about his wife and their family. But the revelations also point the way toward a future where love goes on - in written words, in memories, and in the promises it&apos;s never too late to keep.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-10-25T12:02:59.175Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:255c9d0394ad75e98d3ba4cd6b326ee3a1205b01","dn":"When I'm Gone by Emily Bleeker EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"255c9d0394ad75e98d3ba4cd6b326ee3a1205b01","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,92,157,3,148,173,117,233,141,59,164,205,107,50,110,227,161,32,91,1]},"name":"When I'm Gone by Emily Bleeker EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
