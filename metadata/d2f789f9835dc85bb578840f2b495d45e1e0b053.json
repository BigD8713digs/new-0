In this moving memoir, she reminisces about growing up with a father who loved his children unconditionally - a cherished model of parenthood she has adopted with her own daughter - how her Christian faith has shaped her life, and the dynamic journalism career that has made her a trusted household name.\r\n\r\nFrom her insightful political coverage, including a sit-down with Melania Trump, to her powerful reporting covering some of the most headline-making national events, to her live coverage, including Pope Francis&apos; visit to New York, Ainsley considers her career and the factors that have propelled her to the top of her field, becoming a cohost of Fox &amp; Friends and contributor to Hannity. Ainsley credits her success to the values she learned from her parents and to the enduring Christian faith that has been her ballast through thick and thin, in good times and in periods of great difficulty.\r\n\r\nFilled with inspirational quotes taken from Scripture, her memoir is infused with her spiritual beliefs and will touch the hearts of all her fans, reminding them to count the blessings God has given them every day of their lives.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-05-10T12:01:23.888Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:d2f789f9835dc85bb578840f2b495d45e1e0b053","dn":"The Light Within Me by Ainsley Earhardt EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"d2f789f9835dc85bb578840f2b495d45e1e0b053","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,247,137,249,131,93,200,91,181,120,132,15,43,73,93,69,225,224,176,83]},"name":"The Light Within Me by Ainsley Earhardt EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
