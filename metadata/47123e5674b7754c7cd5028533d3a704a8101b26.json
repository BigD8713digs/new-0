Anything but superior.\r\nIt was obvious evil as evidenced by the way it was carried out, and given\r\nthe apparent natures of those involved in the worst offenses against human beings\r\nall throughout Europe back then.\r\n\r\nPlease seed if you are able - with thanks\r\n\r\nMichael Rizzo Chessman\r\n(moviesbyrizzo)","last_updated":"2018-09-10T12:37:40.633Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:47123e5674b7754c7cd5028533d3a704a8101b26","dn":"Judgment at Nuremberg (1961) H.264 PAL DVD Multi (moviesbyrizzo)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"47123e5674b7754c7cd5028533d3a704a8101b26","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,18,62,86,116,183,117,76,124,213,2,133,51,211,167,4,168,16,27,38]},"name":"Judgment at Nuremberg (1961) H.264 PAL DVD Multi (moviesbyrizzo)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
