Even Emma and Andrew&apos;s elder daughter - who is usually off saving the world - will be joining them at Weyfield Hall, their aging country estate. But Olivia, a doctor, is coming home only because she has to. Having just returned from treating an epidemic abroad, she&apos;s been told she must stay in quarantine for a week...and so, too, should her family.\r\n\r\nFor the next seven days, the Birches are locked down, cut off from the rest of humanity - and even decent Wi-Fi - and forced into each other&apos;s orbits. Younger, unabashedly frivolous daughter Phoebe is fixated on her upcoming wedding while Olivia deals with the culture shock of being immersed in first-world problems.\r\n\r\nAs Andrew sequesters himself in his study writing scathing restaurant reviews and remembering his glory days as a war correspondent, Emma hides a secret that will turn the whole family upside down.\r\n\r\nIn close proximity, not much can stay hidden for long, and as revelations and long-held tensions come to light, nothing is more shocking than the unexpected guest who&apos;s about to arrive....\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-10-21T12:01:12.879Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:86cefd1eef4b4c84277d0f0f51ad4db66a98b73f","dn":"Seven Days of Us by Francesca Hornak EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"86cefd1eef4b4c84277d0f0f51ad4db66a98b73f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,206,253,30,239,75,76,132,39,125,15,15,81,173,77,182,106,152,183,63]},"name":"Seven Days of Us by Francesca Hornak EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
