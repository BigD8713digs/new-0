Even if they succeed in earning a good grade, they often still feel confused and unconfident. Why is this? And what can be done to help every student succeed in this vitally important course? Success in chemistry, according to veteran science teacher Professor Frank Cardulla, doesn&apos;t require any special intellectual gifts or talents or advanced mathematical skill. All it requires is a genuine understanding of the ideas that students encounter in the high school chemistry classroom. If students truly understand what they are learning, they will do more than just succeed in high school chemistry; they will find lasting success as they continue to study chemistry in college and beyond.\r\n\r\nThanks for your time","last_updated":"2018-10-03T12:10:31.552Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:e7ee7642b1bc5fe6d72a0057f71456a20f0d1252","dn":"TTC TGC High School Chemistry v2.0- OVB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"e7ee7642b1bc5fe6d72a0057f71456a20f0d1252","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,238,118,66,177,188,95,230,215,42,0,87,247,20,86,162,15,13,18,82]},"name":"TTC TGC High School Chemistry v2.0- OVB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
