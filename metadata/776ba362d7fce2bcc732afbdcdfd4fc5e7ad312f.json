Today, the company&apos;s annual revenue exceeds the GDP of over 100 countries, and its portfolio has grown to include Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm, ABC, and ESPN.\r\n\r\nWith a company so diversified, is it still possible to identify a coherent Disney vision or message?\r\n\r\nDisney Culture proposes that there is still a unifying Disney ethos, one that can be traced back to the corporate philosophy that Walt Disney himself developed back in the 1920s.\r\n\r\nYet, as cultural historian John Wills demonstrates, Disney&apos;s values have also adapted to changing social climates. At the same time, the world of Disney has profoundly shaped how Americans view the world.\r\n\r\nWills offers a nuanced take on the corporate ideologies running through animated and live-action Disney movies from Frozen to Fantasia, from Mary Poppins to Star Wars: The Force Awakens.\r\n\r\nBut Disney Culture encompasses much more than just movies as it explores the intersections between Disney&apos;s business practices and its cultural mythmaking. Welcome to &quot;the Disney Way.&quot;\r\n\r\nJOHN WILLS is a senior lecturer in American history and the director of American Studies at the University of Kent in Canterbury, England. He is the author of Conservation Fallout: Nuclear Protest at Diablo Canyon, California and U.S. Environmental History: Inviting Doomsday","last_updated":"2017-09-15T12:00:42.166Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:776ba362d7fce2bcc732afbdcdfd4fc5e7ad312f","dn":"Disney Culture (Quick Takes: Movies and Popular Culture)/John Wi","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"776ba362d7fce2bcc732afbdcdfd4fc5e7ad312f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,107,163,98,215,252,226,188,199,50,175,189,205,253,79,197,231,173,49,47]},"name":"Disney Culture (Quick Takes: Movies and Popular Culture)/John Wi","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
