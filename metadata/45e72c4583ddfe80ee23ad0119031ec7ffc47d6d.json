Finally, an appendix gives a brief overview of the fundamentals of aerodynamics and heat transfer, which is a prerequisite for the study of pyrodynamics.\r\nA detailed reference for readers interested in rocketry or explosives technology","last_updated":"2017-06-08T12:01:50.421Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:45e72c4583ddfe80ee23ad0119031ec7ffc47d6d","dn":"Propellants and Explosives - Thermochemical Aspects of Combustio","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"45e72c4583ddfe80ee23ad0119031ec7ffc47d6d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,231,44,69,131,221,254,128,238,35,173,1,25,3,30,199,255,196,125,109]},"name":"Propellants and Explosives - Thermochemical Aspects of Combustio","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
