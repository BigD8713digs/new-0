According to Shapiro, television isn&apos;t just about entertainment - it&apos;s an attempt to convince Americans that the social, economic, and foreign policy shaped by leftism is morally righteous.\r\n\r\nBut don&apos;t take his word for it. Shapiro interviewed more than 100 of the industry&apos;s biggest players, including Larry Gelbart (M*A*S*H), Marta Kauffman (Friends), David Shore (House), and Mark Burnett (Survivor). Many of these insiders boast that not only is Hollywood biased against conservatives, but that many of the shows being broadcast have secret political messages. After hearing this groundbreaking expos&#xE9;, readers will never watch television the same way again.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-12-22T12:03:58.901Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:3bcc5b161b4690ebbd10ebc310ff4930ea773db4","dn":"Primetime Propaganda by Ben Shapiro EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"3bcc5b161b4690ebbd10ebc310ff4930ea773db4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,204,91,22,27,70,144,235,189,16,235,195,16,255,73,48,234,119,61,180]},"name":"Primetime Propaganda by Ben Shapiro EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
