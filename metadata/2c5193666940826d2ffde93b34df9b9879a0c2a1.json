In New York Times bestselling author Kay Hooper&#x2019;s new novel, the answer lies in the twisting shadows of a small town, and its secrets yet unearthed....\r\n\r\nWhen Deacon James&#x2019;s younger sister Melanie calls him, terrified, he goes to her aid in the small Georgia town of Sociable. What he finds is a scared young woman in the grip of what she insists is a paranormal nightmare&#x2014;and murder. Two local men have been killed under mysterious circumstances. And Melanie is the prime suspect.\r\n\r\nTrinity Nichols left a high-stress job for quiet, small-town life. But news of the murders has left her&#x2014;and the town&#x2014;on edge, especially when there is nothing remotely ordinary about how the men died. And her investigation is yielding more than she bargained for, including a group of strangers who have descended on Sociable, some with abilities Trinity finds hard to believe, and agendas she refuses to trust. For some reason, they know a lot more than they should about what&#x2019;s happening in town. And what&#x2019;s happening is growing stranger by the minute.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-10-13T12:06:21.699Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c5193666940826d2ffde93b34df9b9879a0c2a1","dn":"Haunted by Kay Hooper EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"2c5193666940826d2ffde93b34df9b9879a0c2a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,81,147,102,105,64,130,109,47,253,233,59,52,223,155,152,121,160,194,161]},"name":"Haunted by Kay Hooper EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
