Uploaded the installer so amaredj31 can crack it ASAP.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPMDG 747-400 V3 for P3D V3 and V4 only. It is NOT CRACKED! I uploaded it so some cracker can get their hands on this and find a way to crack it. \r\n\r\nInstaller Version: 3.00.8313\r\n\r\nRelease Date: 6/3/2017\r\n\r\nFile Name: PMDG_747-400_QOTSII_P3D.zip\r\n\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nINFORMATION ABOUT THE PMDG 747 V3:\r\n\r\nPMDG is proud to offer the PMDG 747-400 Queen of the Skies II for Lockheed Martin&apos;s Prepar3D (v3.3 and up)*\r\n\r\nThe most iconic sillhouette in aviation. \r\n\r\nDeveloped over three years and building upon all of the award-winning features of the PMDG 737NGX and PMDG 777 products, the PMDG 747-400 Queen of the Skies II is our most magnificent creation yet. \r\n\r\nWe have included every variant of the aircraft in this single package. The ubiquitous passenger 400 and freighter 400F models, the cargo-converted BCF, the &quot;combi&quot; 400M model, the extended range 400ER and 400ERF, and even the rare 400D domestic model that was used in Japan. Each variant is modelled with accurate weights, range and engine options. \r\n\r\nNo less than 35 pages of detailed options from the world&apos;s 747-400 fleets are modeled. From the highly visible ones like antenna types and position all the way to obscure cockpit display and FMC options that real-world crews will recognize, it is the most complete set of options ever placed into a P3D addon aircraft. \r\n\r\n\r\n*Product tested with Lockheed Martin Prepar3D v3.3 and up. (Including v4) NOT COMPATIBLE WITH PREPAR3D 2.x","last_updated":"2017-06-04T12:02:06.937Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d576fa665ebed40d10a1df7970e733194864105","dn":" [P3D V3/V4] PMDG 747 V3 New Installer for Prepar3D V4","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"9d576fa665ebed40d10a1df7970e733194864105","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,87,111,166,101,235,237,64,209,10,29,247,151,14,115,49,148,134,65,5]},"name":" [P3D V3/V4] PMDG 747 V3 New Installer for Prepar3D V4","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
