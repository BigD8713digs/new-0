A delicious and versatile fish, it can be used to make sashimi, cold smoked for lox, or shaped into a fishcake as an alternative to hamburgers. But while salmon is enjoyed all over the globe, it also swims at the center of controversy, with commercial fishing, global warming, and loss of freshwater habitats all threatening salmon populations and the ecological and health impacts of intense salmon farming under fire. In this beautifully illustrated book, Nicolaas Mink takes readers on a culinary journey from the coast of Alaska to the rivers of Scotland, tracing salmon&#x2019;s history from the earliest known records to the present. He tells the story of how the salmon was transformed from an abundant fish found seasonally along coastal regions to a mass-produced canned food and a highly prized culinary delight. Exploring the nutritional benefits of this fish, he examines recent studies that show how these benefits diminish in farm-raised salmon. With many delicious recipes, Salmon is the perfect gift for every fish lover.\r\n\r\nGenre: Non-Fiction &gt; General","last_updated":"2018-09-15T12:18:00.492Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:b297360237e8a0877bede33ddb75c4ca50356b94","dn":"Salmon: a Global History by Nicolaas Mink (.pdf)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"b297360237e8a0877bede33ddb75c4ca50356b94","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,151,54,2,55,232,160,135,123,237,227,61,219,117,196,202,80,53,107,148]},"name":"Salmon: a Global History by Nicolaas Mink (.pdf)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
