It was founded in Chicago in 1953, by Hugh Hefner and his associates, and funded in part by a $1,000 loan from Hefner&apos;s mother. Notable for its centerfolds of nude and semi-nude models (Playmates), Playboy played an important role in the sexual revolution and remains one of the world&apos;s best-known brands, having grown into Playboy Enterprises, Inc., with a presence in nearly every medium. In addition to the flagship magazine in the United States, special nation-specific versions of Playboy are published worldwide.\r\n\r\nThe magazine has a long history of publishing short stories by notable novelists such as Arthur C. Clarke, Ian Fleming, Vladimir Nabokov, Saul Bellow, Chuck Palahniuk, P. G. Wodehouse, Haruki Murakami, and Margaret Atwood. With a regular display of full-page color cartoons, it became a showcase for notable cartoonists, including Harvey Kurtzman, Jack Cole, Eldon Dedini, Jules Feiffer,] Shel Silverstein, Erich Sokol, Roy Raymonde,] Gahan Wilson, and Rowland B. Wilson. Playboy features monthly interviews of notable public figures, such as artists, architects, economists, composers, conductors, film directors, journalists, novelists, playwrights, religious figures, politicians, athletes and race car drivers. The magazine generally reflects a liberal editorial stance, although it often interviews conservative celebrities.\r\nThe front cover of the first issue of Playboy, December 1953\r\n\r\nAfter a year-long removal of most nude photos in Playboy magazine, the March-April 2017 issue brought back nudity.\r\n\t[IMG]https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a8/PlayboyLogo.svg/188px-PlayboyLogo.svg.png[/IMG]","last_updated":"2017-06-17T12:00:19.099Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:310ad0153836eeb91030beb058baf92a45d7b12a","dn":"Playboy Philippines - Issue 79 - March-April 2017 - True PDF - z","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"310ad0153836eeb91030beb058baf92a45d7b12a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,10,208,21,56,54,238,185,16,48,190,176,88,186,249,42,69,215,177,42]},"name":"Playboy Philippines - Issue 79 - March-April 2017 - True PDF - z","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
