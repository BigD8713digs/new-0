But Israel&apos;s continued occupation of the region since 1967 is threatening the traditional way of life, restricting Palestinian development on the land, and Bedouin homes in the area have repeatedly been razed.\r\nSome 56,000 Palestinians live in the part of the valley that lies in the West Bank - many are Bedouin living in temporary communities, always moving with the herds.\r\nMaysara Films.\r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC High L3.1\r\n * Video Bitrate: CRF 20 (~2817Kbps)\r\n * Video Resolution: 1280x664\r\n * Frame Rate: 25 FPS\r\n * Audio Codec: HE-AAC\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 64Kbps CBR 24KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: 2\r\n * Run-Time: 48 mins\r\n * Part Size: 1 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV","last_updated":"2018-09-02T12:05:32.527Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:ada5314df62c2527d654691a17ad02fa3f44e92a","dn":"Al-Jazeera World 2012 Shepherds of the Jordan Valley 720p x264 A","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"ada5314df62c2527d654691a17ad02fa3f44e92a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,165,49,77,246,44,37,39,214,84,105,26,23,173,2,250,63,68,233,42]},"name":"Al-Jazeera World 2012 Shepherds of the Jordan Valley 720p x264 A","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
