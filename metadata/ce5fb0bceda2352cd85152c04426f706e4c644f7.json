This stimulating, illuminating, and thoughtfully presented work explores the early stages of this scientific revolution, beginning with the rediscovery of Greek ideas in the mid-15th century and culminating with Galileo&apos;s brilliant Dialogue on the Two Chief Systems of the World in 1630.\r\n\r\nNoted historian of science Marie Boas Hall first gives a general account of scientific thought in the mid-1400s, then examines the Copernican revolution and the anatomical work of Vesalius and his contemporaries, the impact of chemical medicine and the efforts of the Swiss physician and alchemist Paracelsus. Also here are insightful discussions of Harvey&apos;s discovery of the circulatory system, the work of Kepler, the effects of Galileo&apos;s telescopic discoveries, and other topics. A series of accompanying illustrations &#x2014; among them a Ptolemaic map, examples of Renaissance engineering, and portraits of Francis Bacon, Tycho Brahe, Vesalius, Kepler, and Galileo &#x2014; enhance this scholarly and informative work.\r\n\r\nHistorian Marie Boas Hall (1919-2009) was a pioneer in the study of the history of science in the 16th and 17th centuries, the so-called Scientific Revolution. In 1981 she and her husband were awarded the George Sarton Medal, the History of Science Society&apos;s most prestigious award, and in 1994 she was elected a Fellow of the British Academy.\r\n\r\nPaperback: 400 pages\r\nPublisher: Dover Publications; Reprint edition (December 14, 2011)","last_updated":"2017-12-30T12:00:29.744Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce5fb0bceda2352cd85152c04426f706e4c644f7","dn":"The Scientific Renaissance 1450-1630","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"ce5fb0bceda2352cd85152c04426f706e4c644f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,95,176,188,237,162,53,44,216,81,82,192,68,38,247,6,228,198,68,247]},"name":"The Scientific Renaissance 1450-1630","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
