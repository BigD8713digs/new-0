Rijnvos studied composition at the Royal Conservatory of The Hague with Jan van Vlijmen and Brian Ferneyhough. He received a DAAD scholarship and attended a postgraduate course at the Musikhochschule in Freiburg. In 1994 he took part in the International Course for Professional Choreographers and Composers at Bretton Hall (Wakefield, UK).\r\nContacts with Morton Feldman and John Cage between 1986-1992 were a major influence on his development. Rijnvos has also been influenced by the works of artists outside of music such as William S. Burroughs, Samuel Beckett, Joseph Beuys and Italo Calvino.\r\nRijnvos has written for solo instrumentalists, small ensembles, symphony and chamber orchestra","last_updated":"2017-07-23T12:01:31.211Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc665eeeb3093e4ac45a79712b6b608766187c77","dn":"Richard Rijnvos 2004 Block Beuys","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"bc665eeeb3093e4ac45a79712b6b608766187c77","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,102,94,238,179,9,62,74,196,90,121,113,43,107,96,135,102,24,124,119]},"name":"Richard Rijnvos 2004 Block Beuys","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
