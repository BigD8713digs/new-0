Bauer - EPUB - AnonCrypt \r\n\r\n\r\nAn eye for an eye&#x2026; \r\nColonel Frank Simmons has never been a friend to SG-1. Working for the shadowy government organization, the NID, he has hatched a horrifying plan to create an army as devastatingly effective as that of any Goa&#x2019;uld. \r\n\r\nAnd he will stop at nothing to fulfill his ruthless ambition, even if that means forfeiting the life of the SGC&#x2019;s Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Janet Fraiser. But Simmons underestimates the bond between Stargate Command&#x2019;s officers. When Fraiser, Major Samantha Carter and Teal&#x2019;c disappear, Colonel Jack O&#x2019;Neill and Dr. Daniel Jackson are forced to put aside personal differences to follow their trail into a world of savagery and death. \r\n\r\nIn this complex story of revenge, sacrifice and betrayal, SG-1 must endure their greatest ordeal&#x2026; \r\n\r\nSurvival of the Fittest \r\nDaniel shuffled over to Jack who seemed to be coming round, his face bone-white under a mudpack. \r\n\r\n&#x201C;Love what they&#x2019;ve done with the gate room.&#x201D; Jack blinked up at the canopy. &#x201C;Where the hell are we? Mato Grosso?&#x201D; \r\n\r\n&#x201C;Doesn&#x2019;t look like Brazil to me.&#x201D; Daniel sniffed, squinting at the blur of a monumental structure behind them. High in the wall, the gate formed the third eye in a stone-carved mask that placidly gazed down at him. &#x201C;My money&#x2019;s on Angkor Wat.&#x201D; \r\n\r\n&#x201C;What encore?&#x201D; \r\n\r\n&#x201C;You know. The Khmer temples in Cambodia.&#x201D; \r\n\r\n&#x201C;Didn&#x2019;t know they kept a Stargate there.&#x201D; \r\n\r\n&#x201C;Uh, they don&#x2019;t, I guess. If they did, somebody&#x2019;d have found it by now.&#x201D; Glancing at fuzzy walls and reliefs again, Daniel said, &#x201C;This is amazing. We definitely need to check out this place. It could&#x2014;&#x201D; \r\n\r\n&#x201C;Daniel!&#x201D; \r\n\r\n&#x201C;Hmm?&#x201D; \r\n\r\n&#x201C;We don&#x2019;t know where we are, we&#x2019;re hogtied, we&#x2019;ve got no weapons or supplies, and we&#x2014; Holy buckets!&#x201D; Jack had finally turned his head to get a spectacular view of Daniel&#x2019;s face. &#x201C;You know, you&#x2019;re&#x2026; Nah, I won&#x2019;t say it.&#x201D; \r\n\r\n&#x201C;Won&#x2019;t say what?&#x201D; \r\n\r\n&#x201C;Uh-uh.&#x201D; \r\n\r\n&#x201C;Jack?&#x201D; \r\n\r\n&#x201C;I&#x2019;m not gonna say you&#x2019;re a sight for sore eyes.&#x201D; \r\n\r\n&#x201C;Very funny.&#x201D; \r\n\r\n&#x201C;That&#x2019;s why I didn&#x2019;t say it.&#x201D;\r\n\r\nOfficial AnonCrypt accounts:  <a href=\"\nhttps://1337x.to/user/AnonCrypt/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://1337x.to/user/AnonCrypt/</a>  <a href=\"\nhttps://katcr.co/user/AnonCrypt/profile/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://katcr.co/user/AnonCrypt/profile/</a>  <a href=\"\nhttps://www.torrentfunk.com/user/anoncrypt.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://www.torrentfunk.com/user/anoncrypt.html</a> \r\n\r\n- Please check the newest torrents as this list will be updated in the future","last_updated":"2018-07-03T12:06:20.364Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:c54fae3ef870abb77b5541d2a941a9d6859c39f0","dn":"Stargate SG-1 - Survival of the Fittest - SG1-07 - Fandemonium","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"c54fae3ef870abb77b5541d2a941a9d6859c39f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,79,174,62,248,112,171,183,123,85,65,210,169,65,169,214,133,156,57,240]},"name":"Stargate SG-1 - Survival of the Fittest - SG1-07 - Fandemonium","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
