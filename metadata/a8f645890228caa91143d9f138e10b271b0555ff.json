Those who survive the spire&apos;s trials return home with an attunement: a mark granting the bearer magical powers. According to legend, those few who reach the top of the tower will be granted a boon by the spire&apos;s goddess.\r\n\r\nHe never returned.\r\n\r\nNow it&apos;s Corin&apos;s turn. He&apos;s headed to the top floor, on a mission to meet the goddess.\r\n\r\nIf he can survive the trials, Corin will earn an attunement, but that won&apos;t be sufficient to survive the dangers on the upper levels. For that he&apos;s going to need training, allies, and a lot of ingenuity.\r\n\r\nThe journey won&apos;t be easy, but Corin won&apos;t stop until he gets his brother back.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-10-02T12:00:49.843Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8f645890228caa91143d9f138e10b271b0555ff","dn":"Sufficiently Advanced Magic (Arcane Ascension series_book 1) by ","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"a8f645890228caa91143d9f138e10b271b0555ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,246,69,137,2,40,202,169,17,67,217,241,56,225,11,39,27,5,85,255]},"name":"Sufficiently Advanced Magic (Arcane Ascension series_book 1) by ","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
