Each episode focuses on a key topic of the war from D-Day to Stalingrad to Germany&apos;s &quot;secret weapons&quot; (the V-1 and V-2 rockets, etc.). The topic is presented thoroughly and with painstaking accuracy. During the program the narrator poses (again, with melodrama) several poignant rhetorical questions, such as &quot;Did Stalin use secret reserve army divisions to stop the Wehrmacht from taking Stalingrad?&quot; And in regard to the heroic rescue at Dunkirk, &quot;Did Hitler purposely order his Panzer divisions to stop their advance, allowing the British and French armies to escape, because he didn&apos;t want to go to war with Britain?&quot; The casual viewer might find this material to be a little heavy, but the student of history, especially of WW II, will enjoy every minute","last_updated":"2017-05-24T11:42:20.999Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a19b4727afa8488ee9e95f9065c57c577bedf2f","dn":"Secrets of World War II dvdrip x265","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"1a19b4727afa8488ee9e95f9065c57c577bedf2f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,25,180,114,122,250,132,136,238,158,149,249,6,92,87,197,119,190,223,47]},"name":"Secrets of World War II dvdrip x265","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
