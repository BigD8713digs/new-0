Argyris, Gunter Faust, Maria Haase, Rudolf Friedrich\r\nEdition: 2015 edition\r\nPublication Date: April 25, 2015\r\nPublisher: Springer\r\nISBN-10: 3662460416\r\nISBN-13: 978-3662460412\r\nPages: 865 pages\r\nFormat: pdf\r\nSize: 55M\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis book is conceived as a comprehensive and detailed text-book on non-linear dynamical systems with particular emphasis on the exploration of chaotic phenomena. The self-contained introductory presentation is addressed both to those who wish to study the physics of chaotic systems and non-linear dynamics intensively as well as those who are curious to learn more about the fascinating world of chaotic phenomena. Basic concepts like Poincar&#xE9; section, iterated mappings, Hamiltonian chaos and KAM theory, strange attractors, fractal dimensions, Lyapunov exponents, bifurcation theory, self-similarity and renormalisation and transitions to chaos are thoroughly explained. To facilitate comprehension, mathematical concepts and tools are introduced in short sub-sections. The text is supported by numerous computer experiments and a multitude of graphical illustrations and colour plates emphasising the geometrical and topological characteristics of the underlying dynamics.\r\n\r\n---\r\n <a href=\"\nhttp://dlfeb.com/book/exploration-of-dynamical-systems-and-chaos-completely-revised-and-enlarged-second-edition/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttp://dlfeb.com/book/exploration-of-dynamical-systems-and-chaos-completely-revised-and-enlarged-second-edition/</a>","last_updated":"2017-07-29T12:00:29.724Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0c814ea16ca933b5a422bd8ec472c253fee401e","dn":"AN EXPLORATION OF DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS AND CHAOS","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"c0c814ea16ca933b5a422bd8ec472c253fee401e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,200,20,234,22,202,147,59,90,66,43,216,236,71,44,37,63,238,64,30]},"name":"AN EXPLORATION OF DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS AND CHAOS","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
