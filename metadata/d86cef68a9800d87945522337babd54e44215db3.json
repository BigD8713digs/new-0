Set in Phoenix, Arizona, it&apos;s a wise, funny, and resonant story about the friendship between four very different women who have one thing in common: they have not fared well with the men in their lives.\r\n\r\nSavannah Jackson is 35, single, and weary of men who can&apos;t make the transition from boyfriend to husband. Bernadine Harris is suddenly single - her husband has left her for a 24-year-old white woman. Marilyn Stokes is on the rebound, regretting the years she wasted on a dead-end relationship and mourning her recent miscarriage. And Gloria Matthews, a single mother whose 16-year-old son has just discovered sex, has spent most of her adult life driving men away with her none-too-subtle hunger for marriage.\r\n\r\nTold from each of these characters&apos; diverse points of view, Waiting to Exhale is about their desire to find good men, exciting men; men who could help them lose the strange feeling that they&apos;ve been holding their breath for as long as they can remember; men who could make them exhale. But it&apos;s also about a different kind of bonding between black women: a rich, supportive, abiding friendship that doesn&apos;t necessarily include men.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-07-19T12:00:54.176Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:d86cef68a9800d87945522337babd54e44215db3","dn":"Waiting to Exhale by Terry McMillan epub RtR","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"d86cef68a9800d87945522337babd54e44215db3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,108,239,104,169,128,13,135,148,85,34,51,123,171,213,78,68,33,93,179]},"name":"Waiting to Exhale by Terry McMillan epub RtR","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
