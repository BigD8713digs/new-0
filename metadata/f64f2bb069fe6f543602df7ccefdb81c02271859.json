Aimed at a non-technical audience, this book aims to de-obfuscate the jargon, explain the various activities that coders undertake, and analyze the specific pressures, priorities, and preoccupations that developers are prone to. In each case it offers pragmatic advice on how to use this knowledge to make effective business decisions and work productively with software teams.\r\n\r\nSoftware projects are, all too often, utter nightmares for everyone involved. Depending on which study you read, between 60 and 90 percent of all software projects are completed late, run over budget, or deliver an inferior quality end product. This blight affects everyone from large organizations trying to roll out business change to tiny startups desperately trying to launch their MVP before the money runs out. While there has been much attention devoted to understanding these failings, leading to the development of entire&#xAD; management methodologies aimed at reducing the failure rate,  such new processes have had, at best, limited success in delivering better results","last_updated":"2017-07-05T12:01:19.052Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:f64f2bb069fe6f543602df7ccefdb81c02271859","dn":"Working with Coders A Guide to Software Development for the Perp","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"f64f2bb069fe6f543602df7ccefdb81c02271859","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,79,43,176,105,254,111,84,54,2,223,124,206,253,184,28,2,39,24,89]},"name":"Working with Coders A Guide to Software Development for the Perp","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
