Lawrence, Ham on Rye offers a crude, brutal, and savagely funny portrait of an outcast&apos;s coming-of-age during the desperate days of the Great Depression","last_updated":"2017-05-24T11:18:35.959Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:92465d50291c3c1465475a9d42164d2298263f2f","dn":"Ham On Rye by Charles Bukowski epub RtR","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"92465d50291c3c1465475a9d42164d2298263f2f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,70,93,80,41,28,60,20,101,71,90,157,66,22,77,34,152,38,63,47]},"name":"Ham On Rye by Charles Bukowski epub RtR","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
