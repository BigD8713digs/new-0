As a young man, he founded a modest line of clothing on a $40 budget by hand-sewing hats between his shifts at Red Lobster. Today, his brand FUBU has over $6 billion in sales.\r\n\r\nConvenient though it might be to believe that you can shortcut your way to the top, says John, the truth is that if you want to get and stay ahead, you need to put in the work. You need to out-think, out-hustle, and out-perform everyone around you. You&apos;ve got to rise and grind every day.\r\n\r\nIn the anticipated follow-up to the best-selling The Power of Broke, Daymond takes an up close look at the hard-charging routines and winning secrets of individuals who have risen to the challenges in their lives and grinded their way to the very tops of their fields. Along the way, he also reveals how grit and persistence both helped him overcome the obstacles he has faced in life and ultimately fueled his success.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-02-03T12:00:58.816Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:3bdf08dada1f28756e62e8795a3a6c80618f5811","dn":"Rise and Grind by Daymond John EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"3bdf08dada1f28756e62e8795a3a6c80618f5811","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,223,8,218,218,31,40,117,110,98,232,121,90,58,108,128,97,143,88,17]},"name":"Rise and Grind by Daymond John EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
