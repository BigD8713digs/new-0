Get hands-on experience using a variety of projects and recipes for everything from home automation to test equipment.\r\n\r\nArduino has taken off as an incredibly popular building block among ubicomp (ubiquitous computing) enthusiasts, robotics hobbyists, and DIY home automation developers. Authors Jonathan Oxer and Hugh Blemings provide detailed instructions for building a wide range of both practical and fun Arduino-related projects, covering areas such as hobbies, automotive, communications, home automation, and instrumentation.\r\n\r\nTake Arduino beyond &#x201C;blink&#x201D; to a wide variety of projects from simple to challenging\r\nHands-on recipes for everything from home automation to interfacing with your car engine management system\r\nExplanations of techniques and references to handy resources for ubiquitous computing projects\r\n\r\nSupplementary material includes a circuit schematic reference, introductions to a range of electronic engineering principles and general hints &amp; tips. These combine with the projects themselves to make Practical Arduino: Cool Projects for Open Source Hardware an invaluable reference for Arduino users of all levels. You&#x2019;ll learn a wide variety of techniques that can be applied to your own projects","last_updated":"2018-08-16T12:07:46.517Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:ecd4470c580581d8f4387ae7e852f5f4840a6a90","dn":"Practical Arduino: Cool Projects for Open Source Hardware ","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"ecd4470c580581d8f4387ae7e852f5f4840a6a90","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,212,71,12,88,5,129,216,244,56,122,231,232,82,245,244,132,10,106,144]},"name":"Practical Arduino: Cool Projects for Open Source Hardware ","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
