Joining a band of inept misfits - a bossy tank, a handsome archer, a depraved mage, and a raging barbarian - you must keep your party&#x2019;s health topped up whilst simultaneously managing dwindling mana reserves.\r\n\r\nNot only can your party be taken down when their health ebbs away, they can also be hit with a range of debilitating status effects. It&#x2019;s like juggling with magic, and the crowd hates you. If you let party members die, they may well go into a sulk in subsequent encounters. Manage moods with magical curatives, death prevention, and witty dialogue choices","last_updated":"2018-04-24T12:11:49.637Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:be5c5268ee3d6a01ffd3d99274d43c43a925778e","dn":"Healer's Quest","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"be5c5268ee3d6a01ffd3d99274d43c43a925778e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,92,82,104,238,61,106,1,255,211,217,146,116,212,60,67,169,37,119,142]},"name":"Healer's Quest","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
