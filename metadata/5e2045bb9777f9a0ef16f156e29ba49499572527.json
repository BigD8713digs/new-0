Considered a classic of children&apos;s literature, the book is among Kipling&apos;s best known works.\r\n\r\nKipling began working on the book by telling the first three chapters as bedtime stories to his daughter Josephine. These had to be told &quot;just so&quot; (exactly in the words she was used to) or she would complain. The stories describe how one animal or another acquired its most distinctive features, such as how the Leopard got his spots. For the book, Kipling illustrated the stories himself.\r\n\r\nThe stories have appeared in a variety of adaptations including a musical and animated films. Evolutionary biologists have noted that what Kipling did in fiction, they have done in reality, providing explanations for the evolutionary development of animal features","last_updated":"2017-07-25T12:03:26.365Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e2045bb9777f9a0ef16f156e29ba49499572527","dn":"JUST SO STORIES - Rudyard Kipling.
