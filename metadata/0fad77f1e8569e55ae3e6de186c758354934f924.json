We can hear and see them if we are only sensitive - or psychic - enough to be aware of them.\r\nRe-examining a fascinating assortment of recorded sightings from as far back as Roman times, the author presents a serious look atnot as chain-rattling spooks or cold clouds of swirling mist, but as actual entities with which we share a greater reality.\r\nNor does he accept thatare merely the spirits if departed people, or energies left behind. Uniquely, Paul Roland provides self-tested evidence on the idea of spirits as the manifestation of people still living, proving that out-of-body experiences are not as rare - or as impossible - as some people might think.\r\nThe result is a profoundly fascinating, thought-provoking book that will challenge your beliefs as never before.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\nIntroduction\r\nChapter 1 Belief in the soul\r\nChapter 2 The night side of nature\r\nChapter 3 Living apparitions\r\nChapter 4 Talking to the dead\r\nChapter 5 The uninvited &#x2013; possession\r\nChapter 6 Haunted houses\r\nChapter 7 Spooky sites\r\nChapter 8hunters\r\nAfterword\r\nBibliography\r\nInternet resources","last_updated":"2017-12-29T12:07:47.916Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:0fad77f1e8569e55ae3e6de186c758354934f924","dn":"The Complete Book of Gs (gnv64)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"0fad77f1e8569e55ae3e6de186c758354934f924","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,173,119,241,232,86,158,85,174,62,109,225,134,199,88,53,73,52,249,36]},"name":"The Complete Book of Gs (gnv64)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
