This hardcover book is also the first translation available in an English language audio format.Older translations altered passages, omitted passages, mistranslated Hitler&apos;s words, made some parts more sensational while concealing the true meaning in other parts of the book. If you have read one of these older translations of Mein Kampf, then you have not read the REAL Mein Kampf which is found only in the Ford Translation.Mein Kampf is often portrayed as nothing more than an Anti-Semitic work, however only 6% of it even talks about the Jews. The rest contains Hitler&apos;s ideas and beliefs for a greater nation plus his plan on how to accomplish that goal. He outlines his plans for not only world conquest, but the conquest of the universe. The majority of the work involves Hitler&apos;s discussion of the German people&apos;s difficult times after the First World War, his political theories and his organization of the Nazi Party, as well as many attacks against his enemies which makes it a very interesting and moving story.Mein Kampf offers an interesting interpretation of politics, people, and foreign policy matters. To characterize it as simply a racist work is to oversimplify its message. Germany did not follow Hitler because he was a racist, they followed him because he promised a great future, and Mein Kampf is where he promised that great future.This edition is the only accurate and complete English translation of Mein Kampf ever made.They have already tried...This is the only edition that was so thoroughly researched and verified that it required a separate book(Mein Kampf: A Translation Controversy) to document the changes and corrections made which prove the dynamic style of the Ford translation is superior to all past mechanical translations","last_updated":"2017-10-10T12:07:53.816Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:f451167d92915a00b37488cb718983c857cf13c0","dn":"Adolf Hitler - Mein Kampf (The New Ford Translation) (pdf)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"f451167d92915a00b37488cb718983c857cf13c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,81,22,125,146,145,90,0,179,116,136,203,113,137,131,200,87,207,19,192]},"name":"Adolf Hitler - Mein Kampf (The New Ford Translation) (pdf)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
