The Carpenters&apos; debut BBC concert, recorded on their first British tour in September 1971.\r\nThe artists lip-synched some tunes, like &quot;Help!&quot; and the Burt Bacharach Medley, but most of the songs on the BBC Concert were performed &apos;as live&apos;. It was recorded on September 25 and aired on BBC1 on November 6, 1971. VH-1 has televised the concert for American audiences, however in order to fit it into a half-hour time slot with commercials, they left out &quot;And When He Smiles&quot;, &quot;I Fell in Love with You&quot;, &quot;That on the Road Look&quot;, and &quot;Lust for Earl and the Married Woman&quot;. In addition to singing, Karen also plays the drums during some of the songs.\r\n\r\nTrack listing\r\n    &quot;Help!&quot; (pre-recorded)\r\n    &quot;Love Is Surrender&quot;\r\n    &quot;Superstar&quot;\r\n    &quot;And When He Smiles&quot;\r\n    &quot;Rainy Days and Mondays&quot;\r\n    &quot;That on the Road Look&quot; (Tony Joe White)\r\n    &quot;I Fell in Love with You&quot; (Karen Carpenter and Doug Strawn)\r\n    &quot;Bacharach/David Medley&quot; (pre-recorded)\r\n    &quot;For All We Know&quot;\r\n    &quot;Lust for Earl and the Married Woman&quot; (Tony Joe White)\r\n    &quot;Sometimes&quot;\r\n    &quot;(They Long to Be) Close to You&quot;\r\n    &quot;We&apos;ve Only Just Begun&quot;\r\n\r\nCover: <a href=\"\nhttps://s17.postimg.org/fc790v0pb/The_Carpenters_-_Live_at_The_BBC_1971.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://s17.postimg.org/fc790v0pb/The_Carpenters_-_Live_at_The_BBC_1971.jpg</a>\r\n\r\nThumbnails: <a href=\"\nhttps://s17.postimg.org/rajc4gb5b/thumbnails.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://s17.postimg.org/rajc4gb5b/thumbnails.jpg</a>","last_updated":"2017-07-26T12:01:43.631Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a604ef08597b7278e97775af6b968562dd204a2","dn":"The Carpenters - Live At The BBC 1971","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"6a604ef08597b7278e97775af6b968562dd204a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,96,78,240,133,151,183,39,142,151,119,90,246,185,104,86,45,210,4,162]},"name":"The Carpenters - Live At The BBC 1971","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
