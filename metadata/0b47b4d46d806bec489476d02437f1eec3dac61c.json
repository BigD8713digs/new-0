She is the legend that will not die - Pope Joan, the ninth-century woman who disguised herself as a man and rose to become the only female ever to sit on the throne of St. Peter.\r\n\r\nNow in this riveting novel, Donna Woolfolk Cross paints a sweeping portrait of an unforgettable heroine who struggles against restrictions her soul cannot accept.\r\n\r\nBrilliant and talented, young Joan rebels against medieval social strictures forbidding women to learn. When her brother is brutally killed during a Viking attack, Joan takes up his cloak - and his identity - and enters the monastery of Fulda. As Brother John Anglicus, Joan distinguishes herself as a great scholar and healer. Eventually, she is drawn to Rome, where she becomes enmeshed in a dangerous web of love, passion, and politics.\r\n\r\nTriumphing over appalling odds, she finally attains the highest office in Christendom - wielding a power greater than any woman before or since. But such power always comes at a price","last_updated":"2017-06-19T12:00:24.349Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b47b4d46d806bec489476d02437f1eec3dac61c","dn":"Donna Woolfolk Cross - Pope Joan 2009 Retail EPUB eBook-BitBook","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"0b47b4d46d806bec489476d02437f1eec3dac61c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,71,180,212,109,128,107,236,72,148,118,208,36,55,241,238,195,218,198,28]},"name":"Donna Woolfolk Cross - Pope Joan 2009 Retail EPUB eBook-BitBook","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
