The story of this twenty-year conflict is illustrated with numerous quotes from a large number of primary sources, many of which are published here for the first time.\r\n\r\nGareth Glover is a former Royal Navy officer and military historian who has made a special study of the Napoleonic Wars for the last thirty years. In addition to writing many articles on aspects of the subject in magazines and journals, his books include Wellington&apos;s Voice, Wellington&apos;s Lieutenant Napoleon&apos;s Gaoler, From Coruna to Waterloo, Eyewitness to the Peninsular War and the Battle of Waterloo, An Eloquent Soldier, six volumes of The Waterloo Archive and Waterloo: Myth and Reality.\r\n\r\nHardcover: 265 pages\r\nPublisher: Pen &amp; Sword Military (26 Jun. 2017)","last_updated":"2017-09-03T12:01:58.098Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:69505ff8322b6e97d43705d9e3eefd146f73b31b","dn":"The Forgotten War Against Napoleon: Mediterranean Conflict","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"69505ff8322b6e97d43705d9e3eefd146f73b31b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,80,95,248,50,43,110,151,212,55,5,217,227,238,253,20,111,115,179,27]},"name":"The Forgotten War Against Napoleon: Mediterranean Conflict","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
