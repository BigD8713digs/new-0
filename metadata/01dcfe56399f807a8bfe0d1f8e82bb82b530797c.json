The narrator&apos;s poverty brings him into contact with strange incidents and characters, which he manages to chronicle with great sensitivity and graphic power. The latter half of the book takes the English narrator to his home city, London, where the world of poverty is different in externals only.\r\n\r\nA socialist who believed that the lower classes were the wellspring of world reform, Orwell actually went to live among them in England and on the continent. His novel draws on his experiences of this world, from the bottom of the echelon in the kitchens of posh French restaurants to the free lodging houses, tramps, and street people of London. In the tales of both cities, we learn some sobering truths about poverty and society.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-08-29T12:04:18.994Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:01dcfe56399f807a8bfe0d1f8e82bb82b530797c","dn":"Down and Out in Paris and London by George Orwell epub RtR","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"01dcfe56399f807a8bfe0d1f8e82bb82b530797c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,220,254,86,57,159,128,122,139,254,13,31,142,130,187,130,181,48,121,124]},"name":"Down and Out in Paris and London by George Orwell epub RtR","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
