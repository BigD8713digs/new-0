Self-released on his own new limited edition imprint 5049 Records and recorded entirely in his apartment during the first half of 2012 &#x201C;Purification/Dissolution&#x201D; marks a new direction of self-reliance, fierce independence and refined DIY aesthetics in Cymerman&#x2019;s work.\r\nOriginally conceived of as a set of live, one-take recordings of clarinet and amplifier improvisations the album was recorded over the course of six months, during which time it took many new transformations and directions. Featuring rich &amp; detailed production and his trademark hyper editing techniques, the focal point of the album is Cymerman&#x2019;s live clarinet improvisations coupled with electronics and amplifier. Sprinkling each piece with discrete elements of feedback and tasteful sections of synth &amp; electronics, each piece unfolds at a more organic pace than much of Cymerman&#x2019;s previous work and presents a much more accurate representation of his live solo concerts","last_updated":"2017-08-20T12:04:11.097Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:e16b4d011e655649723faebe326cc7ff53344926","dn":"Jeremiah Cymerman 2012 Purification / Dissolution","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"e16b4d011e655649723faebe326cc7ff53344926","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,107,77,1,30,101,86,73,114,63,174,190,50,108,199,255,83,52,73,38]},"name":"Jeremiah Cymerman 2012 Purification / Dissolution","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
