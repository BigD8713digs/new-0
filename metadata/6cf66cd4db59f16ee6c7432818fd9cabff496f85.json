Helping the band to achieve this deft balance is journeyman British guitarist and producer Leo Abrahams. Working with Abrahams, the Editors have adopted a dynamic studio sheen that gives hooky cuts like the propulsively anthemic &quot;Magazine&quot; and the Kate Bush-meets-Peter Gabriel-sounding &quot;Darkness at the Door&quot; an added theatrical wallop. It&apos;s an approach that works equally well on the more vintage-leaning tracks, as on the arch &quot;Counting Spooks&quot; and the hooky &quot;Nothingness,&quot; where the band draw heavily upon Giorgio Moroder&apos;s synthy dance-pop. Pleasantly, while there is an evident move toward bigger pop hooks and production on Violence, the band are clearly still interested in wrestling with timely issues and real emotions. &quot;Hallelujah (So Low)&quot; was purportedly written after Smith returned from an Oxfam trip to help Syrian refugees in Northern Greece. He sings &quot;I bleed like a millionaire, cause my bones lay with dust in your care.&quot; Interestingly, they also make room for an equally timely reworking of their ballad &quot;No Sound But the Wind,&quot; which was inspired by Cormac McCarthy&apos;s post-apocalyptic novel The Road and originally featured on the Twilight Saga: New Moon Soundtrack.  With Violence, the Editors have crafted a big pop album on their own terms, rife with grand, operatic gestures and heat-seeking hooks that cut deep, just as they put salve on your wounds","last_updated":"2018-03-20T12:05:08.444Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:6cf66cd4db59f16ee6c7432818fd9cabff496f85","dn":"Editors - Violence (2018) [24.44 FLAC]","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"6cf66cd4db59f16ee6c7432818fd9cabff496f85","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,246,108,212,219,89,241,110,230,199,67,40,24,253,156,171,255,73,111,133]},"name":"Editors - Violence (2018) [24.44 FLAC]","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
