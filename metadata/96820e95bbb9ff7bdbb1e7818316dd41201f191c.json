He continues to explore the intersection between acoustic instruments and electronic sounds. Diving deeper into repetitive structures and their mutations, as well as resonant frequencies of acoustic instruments. Once again this album was recorded &amp; mixed entirely by Majkowski over the course of a few months in 2016 and beautifully mastered by the one and only Lawrence English","last_updated":"2017-07-23T12:01:27.366Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:96820e95bbb9ff7bdbb1e7818316dd41201f191c","dn":"Mike Majkowski 2017 Days And Other Days","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"96820e95bbb9ff7bdbb1e7818316dd41201f191c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,130,14,149,187,185,255,123,219,177,231,129,131,22,221,65,32,31,25,28]},"name":"Mike Majkowski 2017 Days And Other Days","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
