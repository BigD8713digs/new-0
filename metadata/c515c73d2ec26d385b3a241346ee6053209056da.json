His 17 years in Formula One have seen him experience everything the sport has to offer, from nursing duff cars round the track to winning world championships and everything in between. Here, Jenson tells his full story for the first time in his own honest, intelligent and eloquent style - from growing up as part of a motor-racing-mad family under the guidance of his father, John, to arriving at Williams as a fresh-faced 20-year-old to being written off as a playboy, distracted by the luxurious trappings of his lifestyle, and his fight back to the very pinnacle of his sport.\r\n\r\nJenson&apos;s world championship victory for the unsponsored and unfancied Brawn GP team is one of the most extraordinary against-the-odds sports stories of the century. Jenson&apos;s book lifts the lid on the gilded and often hidden world of Formula One. He reveals his relationships with some of the biggest names in the sport - Lewis Hamilton, Michael Schumacher and Fernando Alonso - as well some of the most colourful characters, such as Bernie Ecclestone, Ron Dennis, Frank Williams and serial winner Ross Brawn.\r\n\r\nAbove all he puts you right inside the cockpit, in the driving seat, travelling at over 200 miles per hour, battling the fear of death, showing you what happens when it goes wrong at high speed and allowing you to experience the euphoria of crossing the line first.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-10-20T12:00:51.386Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:c515c73d2ec26d385b3a241346ee6053209056da","dn":"Jenson Button_ Life to the Limit by Jenson Button EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"c515c73d2ec26d385b3a241346ee6053209056da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,21,199,61,46,194,109,56,91,58,36,19,70,238,96,83,32,144,86,218]},"name":"Jenson Button_ Life to the Limit by Jenson Button EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
