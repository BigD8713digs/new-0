The conflicts in the series, both internal and external, stem from the elimination-style format of the show. Early in the season, the bachelorette goes on large group dates with the men, with the majority of men eliminated. As the season progresses, men are also eliminated on one-on-one dates and on elimination two-on-one dates. The process culminates with hometown visits to the families of the final few men, overnight dates, should they choose to accept, at exotic locations with the final three men, and interaction with the bachelorette&apos;s family with the final two men.\r\n\r\nSCREENSHOTS <a href=\"\nhttps://extraimage.net/images/2017/10/11/3aef232009b8fd60768a3a9093791576.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://extraimage.net/images/2017/10/11/3aef232009b8fd60768a3a9093791576.jpg</a>","last_updated":"2017-10-11T12:01:28.299Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:096029a68dfc2e82a0f0c0d8ae9b23daa4861820","dn":"The.Bachelorette.Australia.S03E07.1080p.x264-CRR","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"096029a68dfc2e82a0f0c0d8ae9b23daa4861820","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,96,41,166,141,252,46,130,160,240,192,216,174,155,35,218,164,134,24,32]},"name":"The.Bachelorette.Australia.S03E07.1080p.x264-CRR","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
