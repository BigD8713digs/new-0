The sound in the room helps to reinforce the chaos of the produced sound, and to make it difficult for the listener to localize sound sources to the various teams that sounds. Their debut album Fish Forms (2008) and the follow up Collab (2010), showed an improvising duo using an overwhelmingly rich sound, on a steady course through a hypnotic drone landscape. Third album, Bucket of Songs (2014), now as a trio with guests, shows a band that has expanded its palette considerably since their previous release. Whereas the focus was previously on a soundscape characterised by long, richly detailed, slowly flowing drones, this new album is more a collection of improvised songs and tunes. The amazing Mariam Wallentin, known from bands like Wildbirds &amp; Peacdrums, Mariam the Believer, Fire! Orchestra, contributes vocals on many of the tracks... - Wiki","last_updated":"2017-08-26T12:02:04.054Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:5812726f9229d687d28d397b0957fefc2e47a2c6","dn":"David Stackenas &amp; Ingar Zach 2007 LabField: Fishforms","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"5812726f9229d687d28d397b0957fefc2e47a2c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,18,114,111,146,41,214,135,210,141,57,123,9,87,254,252,46,71,162,198]},"name":"David Stackenas &amp; Ingar Zach 2007 LabField: Fishforms","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
