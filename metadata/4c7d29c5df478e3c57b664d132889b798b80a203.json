The 1966-68 NBC show was a fast-paced farce interspersed with musical &quot;romps&quot; featuring the band&apos;s catchy tunes written by professional songwriters. Despite the show lasting just two seasons, the Monkees became a real recording, touring group and are remembered as iconic pop-culture figures of the 1960s.\r\n(TVDB)\r\n\r\nTwo Seasons, 66 files: 58 episodes, 8 specials.\r\n(Including &quot;33 1/3 Revolutions Per Monkee&quot;)\r\n\r\n- Ripped from DVD9 with DVDFab 10 (x265 10bit 2-pass) to MKV.\r\n\r\nVideo/Audio quality almost indistinguishable from the original DVD at 1/3 the original size.\r\n\r\nContainer   : Matroska Multimedia Container (.mkv)\r\nVideo       : 632x480 at 23.976 fps.\r\nFormat      : HEVC (x265) 10 bit, 2-pass HQ\r\nBitrate     : Target 1550 kb/s\r\nAudio       : English, 448 kb/s, 48.0 kHz, 16 bit, 6 channels, AC-3\r\nSubs        : None\r\n\r\nFile Size   : Approximately 380 MB per episode\r\n\r\nIMDB        : https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060010\r\nTVDB        : https://www.thetvdb.com/series/the-monkees\r\n\r\nDetails     : You&apos;ll note some jumpiness in the video in places; this is on the original DVDs as well.
