Kinsey, whose sex research shook America&#x2019;s moral foundations and launched the 1960s Sexual Revolution. Fifty years later new revelations confirm Dr. Judith Reisman&#x2019;s 1981 expose of scientific fraud and criminally derived data contained in the publicly funded Kinsey Reports. Dr. Reisman revealed that Kinsey conducted human experiments in a soundproof laboratory built to his specifications at Indiana University, and that the sexual abuse of at least 317 infants and young boys was a scientific protocol for Kinsey&#x2019;s 1948 report. Dr. Reisman discloses for the first time the ongoing consequences to the American people and the world based on Kinsey&#x2019;s deliberately skewed research. Kinsey died in 1956 but his Institute endures today under the expanded title of &#x201C;The Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender and Reproduction,&#x201D; suggesting an even more ominous threat to human rights and liberty","last_updated":"2017-06-16T12:05:01.252Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:eed201df3ac5bba869c39ee27043efcd8f8c7564","dn":"Judith A.
