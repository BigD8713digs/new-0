Once you have a grasp of the basics, IP addressing is the next step. In this course, Timothy Pintello walks through the essential concepts, including common numbering systems and logical vs. physical IP addressing. He also discusses the IPv4 and IPv6 addressing schemes, and various IP addressing resolution techniques (such as DHCP and DNS).\r\nTopics include:\r\nBinary, hexadecimal, and octal numbering\r\nHow logical and physical addressing work together\r\nComparing broadcast and collision domains\r\nIPv4 classless addressing\r\nSubnetting with IPv4 and IPv6\r\nIPv6 reserved ranges\r\nIPv6 link local, 6to4 tunneling, and 4to6\r\nConfiguring DHCP and DNS in Windows Server\r\nWINS and NAT\r\nPort, packets, and remote access","last_updated":"2017-07-16T12:04:13.475Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee2868fb01497076d442ecb4639b2dbe110e314e","dn":"Lynda - Networking Foundations IP Addressing","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"ee2868fb01497076d442ecb4639b2dbe110e314e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,40,104,251,1,73,112,118,212,66,236,180,99,155,45,190,17,14,49,78]},"name":"Lynda - Networking Foundations IP Addressing","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
