Perry EPUB\r\n\r\nWhat traumatized children can teach us about loss, love, and healing.\r\n\r\nWhat happens when a young child is traumatized? How does terror affect a child&apos;s mind---and how can that mind recover? Child psychiatrist Bruce Perry has treated children faced with unimaginable horror: genocide survivors, witnesses to their own parents&apos; murders, children raised in closets and cages, the Branch Davidian children, and victims of family violence. In The Boy Who Was Raised as a Dog, he tells their stories of trauma and transformation. Dr. Perry clearly explains what happens to the brain when children are exposed to extreme stress. He reveals his innovative methods for helping to ease their pain, allowing them to become healthy adults. This deeply informed and moving book dramatically demonstrates that only when we understand the science of the mind can we hope to heal the spirit of even the most wounded child.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-10-09T12:02:21.294Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:c80a8754503be7bfbd9db304b00374a9f6738ad5","dn":"The Boy Who Was Raised as a Dog by Bruce D.
