It is known for its absurdist humor and style, with outlandish losing acts being more memorable than the winners, and often awarding ridiculous and worthless prizes.\r\n\r\nIt was broadcast on NBC&apos;s daytime schedule from June 14, 1976, through July 21, 1978, and in first-run syndication from 1976 to 1980 and 1988 to 1989. The Gong Show was revived in 2017 for broadcast on ABC. The show was created and originally produced by Chuck Barris, who also served as host for the NBC run and from 1977 to 1980 in syndication.\r\n \r\nThe 2017 version was produced by Will Arnett and hosted by Tommy Maitland, who is actually a fictitious British celebrity that is portrayed by actor Mike Myers.
