Taking a year off, he journeyed through Europe and America seeking out extraordinary communities that could teach him how to share. He wanted answers to a few troubling questions: Is modern life rubbish? Why do so many of us feel lonely and unfulfilled despite a high standard of living?

And if so, why do so many of their inhabitants insist on dressing in tie-dye?\r\n\r\nGenre: Non-Fiction &gt; Health, Fitness &amp; Medical","last_updated":"2018-09-17T12:16:58.062Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e9a35157ef673abdaf863c0294bf13fb79f3979","dn":"The No.9 B Utopia by David Bramwell (.epub)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"8e9a35157ef673abdaf863c0294bf13fb79f3979","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,154,53,21,126,246,115,171,218,248,99,192,41,75,241,63,183,159,57,121]},"name":"The No.9 B Utopia by David Bramwell (.epub)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
