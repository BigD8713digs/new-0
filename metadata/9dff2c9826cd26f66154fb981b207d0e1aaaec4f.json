The time has come to stake your claim on the Red Planet and \r\n build the first functioning human colonies on Mars! All you need are \r\n supplies, oxygen, decades of training, experience with sandstorms, and a\r\n can-do attitude to discover the purpose of those weird black cubes that \r\n appeared out of nowhere. With a bit of sprucing up, this place is going to\r\n be awesome!\r\n Surviving Mars is a sci-fi city builder all about colonizing Mars and\r\n surviving the process. Choose a space agency for resources and financial\r\n support before determining a location for your colony. Build domes and \r\n infrastructure, research new possibilities and utilize drones to unlock\r\n more elaborate ways to shape and expand your settlement. Cultivate your \r\n own food, mine minerals or just relax by the bar after a hard day&apos;s work.\r\n Most important of all, though, is keeping your colonists alive. Not an \r\n easy task on a strange new planet.\r\n There will be challenges to overcome. Execute your strategy and improve your\r\n colony&apos;s chances of survival while unlocking the mysteries of this alien \r\n world. Are you ready? Mars is waiting for you. \r\n \r\n Our friends in CODEX released the basic version. For our friends we decided\r\n to bring a internal release with digital deluxe edition version","last_updated":"2018-11-17T12:28:49.530Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:9dff2c9826cd26f66154fb981b207d0e1aaaec4f","dn":"Surviving_Mars_Internal-Razor1911","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"9dff2c9826cd26f66154fb981b207d0e1aaaec4f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,255,44,152,38,205,38,246,97,84,251,152,27,32,125,14,26,170,236,79]},"name":"Surviving_Mars_Internal-Razor1911","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
