Drawing on 25 years of historical scholarship, it sheds new light on culturally significant issues such as how families and medical authorities adapted to the challenges of war and the shift that occurred in gender roles and behaviour that would subsequently reshape society. Adopting a transnational approach, this volume surveys the war&apos;s treatment of populations at risk, including refugees, minorities and internees, to show the full extent of the disaster of war and, with it, the stubborn survival of irrational kindness and the generosity of spirit that persisted amidst the bitterness at the heart of warfare, with all its contradictions and enduring legacies.\r\nGenre: Non-Fiction &gt; History","last_updated":"2018-10-13T12:43:36.444Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f95249df5e5888a68bfcacb809fe68e5424ba98","dn":"The First World War: Volume 3, Civil Society by Jay Winter(epub)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"8f95249df5e5888a68bfcacb809fe68e5424ba98","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,149,36,157,245,229,136,138,104,191,202,203,128,159,230,142,84,36,186,152]},"name":"The First World War: Volume 3, Civil Society by Jay Winter(epub)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
