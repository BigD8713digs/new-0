She was immortalized as the nude beauty facing down Duchamp and as one of Ed Ruscha&apos;s Five 1965 Girlfriends, and Babitz&apos;s first book showed her to be a razor-sharp writer with tales of her own.\r\n\r\nEve&apos;s Hollywood is an album of vivid snapshots of Southern California&apos;s haute bohemians, of outrageously beautiful high school ingenues and enviably tattooed Chicanas, of rock stars sleeping it off at the Chateau Marmont. And though Babitz&apos;s prose might appear careening, she&apos;s in control as she takes us on a ride through an LA of perpetual delight, from a joint serving the perfect taquito to the corner of La Brea and Sunset, where we make eye contact with a roller-skating hooker, to the Watts Towers. This &quot;daughter of the wasteland&quot; is here to show us that her city is no wasteland at all but a glowing landscape of swaying fruit trees and blooming bougainvillea, buffeted by earthquakes and the Santa Ana winds - and every bit as seductive as she is.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-12-03T12:00:55.437Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:a031de3390caf620b03139ac3efa5c955e2702db","dn":"Eve's Hollywood by Eve Babitz EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"a031de3390caf620b03139ac3efa5c955e2702db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,49,222,51,144,202,246,32,176,49,57,172,62,250,92,149,94,39,2,219]},"name":"Eve's Hollywood by Eve Babitz EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
