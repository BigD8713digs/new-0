Plying her bloody trade in a backwater of the Republic, she&#x2019;s no closer to ending Consul Scaeva and Cardinal Duomo, or avenging her familia. And after a deadly confrontation with an old enemy, Mia begins to suspect the motives of the Red Church itself.\r\nWhen it&#x2019;s announced that Scaeva and Duomo will be making a rare public appearance at the conclusion of the grand games in Godsgrave, Mia defies the Church and sells herself to a gladiatorial collegium for a chance to finally end them. Upon the sands of the arena, Mia finds new allies, bitter rivals, and more questions about her strange affinity for the shadows. But as conspiracies unfold within the collegium walls, and the body count rises, Mia will be forced to choose between loyalty and revenge, and uncover a secret that could change the very face of her world.\r\n\r\nEnjoy and please SEED!!!","last_updated":"2017-09-04T12:05:36.208Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:b723aa44139dc51c01c4e8bd0afec2ed372f02f1","dn":"Godsgrave - Jay Kristoff [EN EPUB] [ebook] [ps]","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"b723aa44139dc51c01c4e8bd0afec2ed372f02f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,35,170,68,19,157,197,28,1,196,232,189,10,254,194,237,55,47,2,241]},"name":"Godsgrave - Jay Kristoff [EN EPUB] [ebook] [ps]","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
