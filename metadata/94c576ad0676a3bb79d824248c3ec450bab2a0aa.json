What is the nature of these close connections? And what if our influence on pets, both in life and especially through sickness and death, is far more powerful than we ever conceived?\r\n\r\nDavid Michie draws on ancient Buddhist wisdom, supported by contemporary science, to provide fascinating insights into animal consciousness. He proposes that the pets with whom we share our lives are not there by accident. Whether your animal companion has fur, feathers or fins, he offers a treasury of practical tools to enhance your relationship with them in everyday life, as well as during times of challenge.\r\n\r\nWritten with humour and compassion, and including extraordinary true stories from around the world, Buddhism for Pet Lovers reveals how our animal companions may indeed be among our most precious partners. For in helping them, our own lives are incomparably enriched too.\r\n\r\n&apos;If you have ever deeply loved an animal, this is, without doubt, the book for you.&apos; Gail Pope, BrightHaven\r\n\r\n&apos;Our pets offer us one of our greatest opportunities to add compassion to the world. This book helps direct us to a path toward the blossoming of that opportunity.&apos; Carl Safina, author of Beyond Words, and What Animals Think and Feel","last_updated":"2017-08-06T12:00:17.073Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:94c576ad0676a3bb79d824248c3ec450bab2a0aa","dn":"Buddhism for Pet Lovers (2017) (Epub) Gooner","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"94c576ad0676a3bb79d824248c3ec450bab2a0aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,197,118,173,6,118,163,187,121,216,36,36,140,62,196,80,186,178,160,170]},"name":"Buddhism for Pet Lovers (2017) (Epub) Gooner","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
