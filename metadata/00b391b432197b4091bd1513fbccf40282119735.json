Some offer ambrosial sweetness; others are as assertive as herbs and spices. Roger Yepsen knows his berries, and in this collection he presents these delightful fruits to the reader, including neglected varieties that have nearly disappeared from the American diet and garden. In this book he offers advice on finding and identifying berries, growing your own, and preserving them for year-round enjoyment. Berries includes nearly 100 recipes. Reading this book is like discovering a wild raspberry in the woods?a sweet surprise and oh, so satisfying.  \r\nOver 60 watercolor illustrations\r\n\r\nAbout the Author\r\nRoger Yepsen is a writer, editor, and illustrator who lives with his wife on a Pennsylvania German farm, near the town of Barto.
