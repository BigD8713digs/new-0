Plaster\r\n\r\nRequirements: .ePUB reader\r\n\r\nOverview: Major John L. Plaster recalls his remarkable covert activities as a member of a special operations team during the Vietnam War in a &#x201C;comprehensive, informative, and often exciting&#x2026;account of an important part of the overall Vietnam tragedy&#x201D; (The New York Times). \r\n\r\nBefore there were Navy SEALs, there was SOG. Short for &#x201C;Studies and Operations Group,&#x201D; it was a secret operations force in Vietnam, the most highly decorated unit in the war. Although their chief mission was disrupting the main North Vietnamese supply route into South Vietnam, SOG commandos also rescued downed helicopter pilots and fellow soldiers, and infiltrated deep into Laos and Cambodia to identify bombing targets, conduct ambushes, mine roads, and capture North Vietnamese soldiers for intelligence purposes.\r\n\r\nGenre: Non-Fiction &gt; History","last_updated":"2018-11-03T12:18:45.928Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c39fa424bba4d91b8502b2f3cb499ba2abaf99c","dn":" Secret Commandos by John L.
