This third edition reflects changes in the dissemination of chemical information, revisions to chemical nomenclature, and the adoption of new techniques in NMR spectroscopy, which have taken place since publication of the last edition in 2011. Organic chemistry embraces many other disciplines - from material sciences to molecular biology - whose practitioners will benefit from the comprehensive but concise information brought together in this book. Extensively revised and updated, this new edition contains the very latest data that chemists need access to for experimentation and research","last_updated":"2017-08-19T12:00:45.466Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d859dbd6d0691890772e9a36a760bfc9d212e93","dn":"Organic Chemist's Desk Reference, Third Edition(2017) - PDF - ze","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"7d859dbd6d0691890772e9a36a760bfc9d212e93","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,133,157,189,109,6,145,137,7,114,233,163,106,118,11,252,157,33,46,147]},"name":"Organic Chemist's Desk Reference, Third Edition(2017) - PDF - ze","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
