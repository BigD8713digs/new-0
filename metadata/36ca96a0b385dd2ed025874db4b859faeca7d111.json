The Bible contains many mentions of astronomical things, beginning\r\nwith creation and concluding with end-time prophecies.\r\nBesides the sun and moon, the Bible names groups of stars, Orion, the Pleiades, and the bears. In addition to what the biblical record shows about astronomical phenomena,many people think that it teaches things that it actually does not teach. These concepts are examined in depth as well.\r\n\r\nDr. Danny Faulkner holds an MS in Physics from Clemson University and an MA and PhD in Astronomy from Indiana University and taught at the University of South Carolina Lancaster for over 26 years. \r\n\r\nPlease seed.
