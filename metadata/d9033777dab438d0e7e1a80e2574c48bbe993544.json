This new edition has been expanded to include AWR, Oracle 12c Statistics, interpretation of SQL Monitor reports, Parallel execution, and Exadata-related features. Reading this book and using SQL helps you learn to tune even the most complex SQL, and you&apos;ll learn to do it quickly, without the huge learning curve usually associated with tuning as a whole.\r\nFirmly based in real-world problems, this book helps you reclaim system resources and avoid the most common bottleneck in overall performance, badly tuned SQL. You&apos;ll learn how the optimizer works, how to take advantage of its latest features, and when it&apos;s better to turn them off.
