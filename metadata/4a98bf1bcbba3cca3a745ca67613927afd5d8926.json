And perhaps the most\r\nimportant movie ever made to expose the mind of evil in what is man.\r\n\r\nThe key actor referred to as having a &quot;malicious personality&quot; even in\r\nhis humour especially, (by the young woman in the movie) is exposed as\r\na bitter, hateful, cruelly inane, retarded imbecile at the business of human\r\nexistentialism. He wants to do evil for its own sake and as the ultimate\r\ntestament to his &quot;superior&quot; form of being that thinks this way (Sounds\r\nlike a witch-like mind to me).\r\n\r\nWhy not murder - just for the thrill of it?\r\n\r\nWell, why not indeed. Thank goodness for the death penalty or\r\nsuch minds if they do exist might someday be brazen enough\r\nto attempt such a thrill perhaps.\r\n\r\nSuch an evil mindset as is described this way in this movie\r\nmust of course never be allowed to prevail with such defective\r\nideas or even be allowed to form or exist in our midst I say.\r\n\r\nMichael Rizzo Chessman\r\n(moviesbyrizzo)","last_updated":"2018-09-08T12:07:53.567Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:4a98bf1bcbba3cca3a745ca67613927afd5d8926","dn":"Rope (1948) (Hitchcock) Full 1080p H.264 Multi (moviesbyrizzo)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"4a98bf1bcbba3cca3a745ca67613927afd5d8926","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,152,191,27,203,186,60,202,58,116,92,166,118,19,146,122,253,93,137,38]},"name":"Rope (1948) (Hitchcock) Full 1080p H.264 Multi (moviesbyrizzo)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
