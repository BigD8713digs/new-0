Known as the Ghan, it travels for 2979 kilometres over 54 hours from the bottom to the top of the country. It begins in the suburban city of Adelaide, traversing a seemingly endless outback that includes the magnificent red centre, ending in the tropical coastal town of Darwin at the north western tip of Australia. The transcontinental train line led to the development of central Australia and the growth of towns along its path - Port Augusta, Alice Springs and Darwin. It took an epic 127 years to complete and was constructed by local Aboriginal surveyors and early immigrants, including the famous Afghan camel drivers, after whom the train is named.\r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n * Video Codec: x265/HEVC CABAC Main10 L3.1\r\n * Video Bitrate: CRF 28 (~930Kbps)\r\n * Video Resolution: 1280x720\r\n * Frame Rate: 25 FPS\r\n * Audio Codec: HE-AAC\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 64Kbps CBR 24KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: 2\r\n * Run-Time: 3 hours\r\n * Part Size: 1.25 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Subtitles: Merged","last_updated":"2018-10-29T12:05:49.663Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd4e8a49779799db0a1122b11c5be1ab1d21381f","dn":"BBC The Ghan Australias Greatest Train Journey 720p x265 AAC HDT","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"fd4e8a49779799db0a1122b11c5be1ab1d21381f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,78,138,73,119,151,153,219,10,17,34,177,28,91,225,171,29,33,56,31]},"name":"BBC The Ghan Australias Greatest Train Journey 720p x265 AAC HDT","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
