The book&#x2019;s empirical model incorporates widely known and accepted principles of ore deposition and shows how it applies in the volcanic-sedimentary greenstone belt environment. Several chapters detail outcrop maps and photos of field occurrences and textures. The interpretations flow directly from the authors&#x2019; field work, and are coupled with analyses of underlying physical processes. Utilizing detailed geological mapping, field work, and chemical analyses as the basis of a syngenetic formation mode, the text arms readers with the tools necessary to accurately analyze and interpret new data on the subject. This includes information on decoding the significance of asymmetry in vein formation, as well as the role of lamprophyres in gold camps, how Archean geology requires integration into a lode vein formation model, and how to develop an understanding of the worldwide applicability of gold cycles to lode vein formation and exploration and how it can be applied to deposits of all ages.\r\n\r\nPresents the first book to galvanize lode gold research into a single authoritative reference\r\nSimplifies the complexity of lode gold&#x2019;s underlying processes and presents valid concepts surrounding the lode gold forming environment\r\nFeatures color figures, illustrations, and photos that enrich the content&#x2019;s focus and aid in the retention of key concepts","last_updated":"2017-06-11T12:05:03.806Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:287d56a66fecb2ef48ef845fcfe56ab95349b4a9","dn":"The Metallogeny of Lode Gold Deposits","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"287d56a66fecb2ef48ef845fcfe56ab95349b4a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,125,86,166,111,236,178,239,72,239,132,95,207,229,106,185,83,73,180,169]},"name":"The Metallogeny of Lode Gold Deposits","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
