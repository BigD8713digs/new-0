This is a story that has long languished untold, buried under different accounts of the dissemination of psychoanalysis. John Forrester and Laura Cameron present a fascinating and deeply textured history of the ways in which a set of Freudian ideas about the workings of the human mind, sexuality and the unconscious, affected Cambridge men and women - from A. G. Tansley and W. H. R. Rivers to Bertrand Russell, Bernal, Strachey and Wittgenstein - shaping their thinking across a range of disciplines, from biology to anthropology, and from philosophy to psychology, education and literature. Freud in Cambridge will be welcomed as a major intervention by literary scholars, historians and all readers interested in twentieth-century intellectual and scientific life.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\nList of Illustrations page viii\r\nPreface xi\r\nAcknowledgements xv\r\nList of Abbreviations xvii\r\n1 Introduction 1\r\n2 Tansley&#x2019;s Dream 7\r\n3 W.H.R.
