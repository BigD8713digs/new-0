The Herald Angels Scream by Christopher Golden EPUB\r\n\r\nEighteen stories of Christmas horror from best-selling, acclaimed authors, including Joe R. Lansdale, Scott Smith, Michael Koryta, Sarah Pinborough, Seanan McGuire, Jonathan Maberry, Kelley Armstrong, and Josh Malerman.  \r\n\r\nThat there is darkness at the heart of the Yuletide season should not surprise. Charles Dickens&apos; A Christmas Carol is filled with scenes that are unsettling. Marley untying the bandage that holds his jaws together. The hideous children - Want and Ignorance - beneath the robe of the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come. The heavy ledgers Marley drags by his chains. In the finest versions of this story, the best parts are the terrifying parts.\r\n\r\nBest-selling author and editor Christopher Golden shares his love for Christmas horror stories with this anthology of all-new short fiction from some of the most talented and original writers of horror today.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-10-29T12:10:26.536Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d9f154b52e17b17ee00f14a0feff8d96d3f9257","dn":"Hark!
