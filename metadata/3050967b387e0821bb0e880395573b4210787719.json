All that is about to change because the traitor, Vasic, is marching on the capital. Against her better judgement, Queen Alwenna allows herself to be spirited away by one of the Crown&apos;s most trusted servants, safe from the clutches of the throne&apos;s would-be usurper.\r\n\r\nFleeing across country, she quickly comes to learn that her pampered existence has ill equipped her for survival away from the comforts of the court. Alwenna must toughen up, and fast, if she is even to make it to a place of safety.\r\n\r\nBut she has an even loftier aim - for after dreaming of her husband&apos;s impending death, Alwenna knows she must turn around and head back to Highkell to save the land she loves and the husband who adores her or die in the attempt. But Vasic the traitor is waiting. And this was all just as he planned.\r\n\r\nSusan Murray is a graduate of the Open University and describes herself as a &quot;serial house renovator&quot;. She was recently longlisted for the Bristol Short Story Prize. The Waterborne Blade is her debut novel.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-06-17T12:03:19.092Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:3050967b387e0821bb0e880395573b4210787719","dn":"The Waterborne Blade by Susan Murray AZW","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"3050967b387e0821bb0e880395573b4210787719","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,80,150,123,56,126,8,33,187,14,136,3,149,87,59,66,16,120,119,25]},"name":"The Waterborne Blade by Susan Murray AZW","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
