But is that true?\r\n\r\nDid he really nail his Ninety-Five Theses to the church door?\r\nDid he throw an inkpot at the devil?\r\nDid he plant an apple tree?\r\nDid his wife escape her convent in a herring barrel?\r\n\r\nGerman radio and television journalist Andreas Malessa looks at the actual history of Luther and concludes that many of the tales we know best are nothing but nonsense.\r\nDiving gleefully into the research, Malessa investigates many of the falsehoods and fallacies surrounding the reformer, rejecting them in favor of equally incredible facts. Full of humor and irony, this book educates and entertains while demonstrating a profound respect for Luther&apos;s life and mission.\r\nIf you&apos;re looking for the truth of the man behind the theses, come discover his faith and influence--with the myths stripped away","last_updated":"2017-10-22T12:01:15.516Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:835e9a58d3252f38b0fb201cd0e79dfd3fe8e694","dn":"Andreas Malessa - The Unreformed Martin Luther","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"835e9a58d3252f38b0fb201cd0e79dfd3fe8e694","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,94,154,88,211,37,47,56,176,251,32,28,208,231,157,253,63,232,230,148]},"name":"Andreas Malessa - The Unreformed Martin Luther","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
