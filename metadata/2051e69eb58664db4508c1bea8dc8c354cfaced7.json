Through the young eyes of Scout and Jem Finch, Harper Lee explores with exuberant humour the irrationality of adult attitudes to race and class in the Deep South of the &apos;30s. The conscience of a town steeped in prejudice, violence, and hypocrisy is pricked by the stamina of one man&apos;s struggle for justice. But the weight of history will tolerate only so much.\r\nTo Kill a Mockingbird is a coming-of-age story, an antiracist novel, a historical drama of the Great Depression and a sublime example of the Southern writing tradition. Out now as an unabridged audiobook, narrated by Sissy Spacek","last_updated":"2017-09-20T12:07:25.876Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:2051e69eb58664db4508c1bea8dc8c354cfaced7","dn":"To Kill a Mockingbird audiobook by Harper Lee [EarReaders]","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"2051e69eb58664db4508c1bea8dc8c354cfaced7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,81,230,158,181,134,100,219,69,8,193,190,168,220,140,53,76,250,206,215]},"name":"To Kill a Mockingbird audiobook by Harper Lee [EarReaders]","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
