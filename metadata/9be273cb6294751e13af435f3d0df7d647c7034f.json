Prussian troops lay siege to an outpost in the far south of Denmark. The conflict is over control of the Duchy of Schleswig, recently annexed by Denmark to the alarm of its largely German-speaking inhabitants. Danish troops make a valiant attempt to hold out but are overrun by the might of the Prussian onslaught.\r\n\r\nOf little strategic importance, the struggle for Schleswig foreshadowed the same forces that, fifty years later, would tear Europe apart. Prussia&apos;s victory would not only rejuvenate its nascent militarism, but help it claim leadership of the new German Empire.\r\n\r\nGenre: Non-Fiction &gt; History","last_updated":"2018-09-11T12:17:15.287Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:9be273cb6294751e13af435f3d0df7d647c7034f","dn":" 1864 by Tom Buk-swienty (.epub)(.azw)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"9be273cb6294751e13af435f3d0df7d647c7034f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,226,115,203,98,148,117,30,19,175,67,95,61,13,247,214,71,199,3,79]},"name":" 1864 by Tom Buk-swienty (.epub)(.azw)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
