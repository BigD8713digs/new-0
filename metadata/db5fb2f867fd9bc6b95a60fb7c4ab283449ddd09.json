You decide where to go, whom to hire or to fight, what contracts to take and how to train and equip your men in a procedurally generated open world campaign. Do you have what it takes to lead them through bloody battles and to victory?\r\n\r\nThe game consists of a strategic worldmap and a tactical combat layer. On the worldmap you can freely travel in order to take contracts that earn you good coin, find places worth looting, enemies worth pursuing or towns to resupply and hire men at. This is also where you manage, level up and equip your Battle Brothers. Once you engage a hostile party the game will switch to a tactical map where the actual fighting takes place as detailed turn based combat.\r\n\r\n\r\nSystem Requirements\r\n\r\nMinimum:\r\nOS: Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 10\r\nProcessor: 1.2 Ghz\r\nMemory: 1024 MB RAM\r\nGraphics: OpenGL 3.3 compatible video card with 512 MB\r\nStorage: 1500 MB available space\r\nAdditional Notes: Make sure your video drivers are up-to-date!\r\n\r\nRecommended:\r\nOS: Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 10\r\nProcessor: 2+ Ghz\r\nMemory: 2048 MB RAM\r\nGraphics: OpenGL 3.3 compatible video card with 1024 MB\r\nStorage: 1500 MB available space\r\nAdditional Notes: Make sure your video drivers are up-to-date!\r\n\r\nHow to install\r\n\r\nAfter download is done:\r\n- open Battle.Brothers.v1.1.0.5.Repack(executable file)\r\n- choose location ,\r\n- click install ,\r\n- wait until is done \r\n- play game from desktop shortcut \r\nor Run ...win32BattleBrothers.exe from the game install path","last_updated":"2017-10-21T12:05:04.081Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:db5fb2f867fd9bc6b95a60fb7c4ab283449ddd09","dn":"Battle.Brothers.v1.1.0.5.Repack","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"db5fb2f867fd9bc6b95a60fb7c4ab283449ddd09","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,95,178,248,103,253,155,198,185,90,96,251,124,74,178,131,68,157,221,9]},"name":"Battle.Brothers.v1.1.0.5.Repack","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
