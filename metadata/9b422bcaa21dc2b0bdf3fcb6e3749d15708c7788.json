He decides to use to his advantage, since being &quot;dead&quot;, he isn&apos;t subject to the rules that bind regular cops. He grabs a fedora, straightens his red tie, puts on a mask and vows to continue to fight crime. The criminals of Central City better watch out for The Spirit! \r\n\r\nWritten by Steven E. de Souza (48 Hrs, Die Hard) and starring Sam Jones (Flash Gordon) and Nana Vistor (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine) this adaptation remains more faithful to Eisner&apos;s character than the 2008 movie. This TV film was meant to act as a pilot for TV series on ABC but was never picked up","last_updated":"2018-10-04T12:23:47.463Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b422bcaa21dc2b0bdf3fcb6e3749d15708c7788","dn":"The Spirit 1987 TV Movie Sam Jones Nana Vistor","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"9b422bcaa21dc2b0bdf3fcb6e3749d15708c7788","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,66,43,202,162,29,194,176,189,243,252,182,227,116,157,21,112,140,119,136]},"name":"The Spirit 1987 TV Movie Sam Jones Nana Vistor","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
