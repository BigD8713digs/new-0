These two men from starkly different worlds profoundly influenced each other&apos;s personal development. Kennedy&apos;s hesitation on civil rights spurred King to greater acts of courage, and King inspired Kennedy to finally make a moral commitment to equality. As America still grapples with the legacy of slavery and the persistence of discrimination, Kennedy and King is a vital, vivid contribution to the literature of the civil rights movement.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-03-26T12:01:07.751Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4efc5c7c1a58fe27265229b993b21f31ead2767","dn":"Kennedy and King by Steven Levingston EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"a4efc5c7c1a58fe27265229b993b21f31ead2767","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,239,197,199,193,165,143,226,114,101,34,155,153,59,33,243,30,173,39,103]},"name":"Kennedy and King by Steven Levingston EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
