You move the hammer with the mouse, and that&apos;s all there is. With practice, you&apos;ll be able to jump, swing, climb and fly. Great mysteries and a wonderful reward await the master hikers who reach the top of the mountain.\r\n\r\nTo quote Jazzuo himself: &quot;The hiking action is very similar to way you would do it in real life, remember that and you will do well&quot;.\r\n\r\nClimb up an enormous mountain with nothing but a hammer and a pot.\r\nListen as I make philosophical observations about the problem at hand.\r\nBetween 2 and 8 hours of agonizing gameplay, depending. The median time to finish for my playtesters was 5 hours, but the mean was closer to 8.\r\nLose all your progress, over and over.\r\nFeel new types of frustration you didn&apos;t know you were capable of.\r\nMagical reward awaits hikers who reach the top","last_updated":"2018-03-12T12:58:29.234Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:213068cde472d0466fe854fee5708627f7458338","dn":"Getting.Over.It.with.Bennett.Foddy-HI2U","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"213068cde472d0466fe854fee5708627f7458338","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,48,104,205,228,114,208,70,111,232,84,254,229,112,134,39,247,69,131,56]},"name":"Getting.Over.It.with.Bennett.Foddy-HI2U","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
