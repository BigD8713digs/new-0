But a key element in any successful nutritional health program is a tried-and-true method that most people haven&apos;t thought about - yet it could be revolutionary for taking health to the next level. This ancient secret is fasting.\r\n\r\nFasting is not about starving oneself. When done right, it&apos;s an incredibly effective therapeutic approach that produces amazing results regardless of diet plan. In fact, Toronto-based nephrologist Dr. Jason Fung has used a variety of fasting protocols with more than 1,000 patients, with fantastic success. In The Complete Guide to Fasting, he has teamed up with international best-selling author and veteran health podcaster Jimmy Moore to explain what fasting is really about, why it&apos;s so important, and how to fast in a way that improves health. Together, they make fasting as a therapeutic approach both practical and easy to understand.\r\n\r\nThe Complete Guide to Fasting explains:\r\n\r\nWhy fasting is actually good for health\r\nWho can benefit from fasting (and who won&apos;t)\r\nThe history of fasting\r\nThe various ways to fast: intermittent, alternate-day, and extended fasting\r\nWhat to expect when starting to fast\r\nHow to track progress while fasting\r\nThe weight loss effects of fasting\r\nHow to ward off potential negative effects from fasting\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-08-14T12:01:09.427Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d7c2499476c387d02cdc28ef97eefb555469d54","dn":"The Complete Guide to Fasting_ Heal Your Body Through Intermitte","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"7d7c2499476c387d02cdc28ef97eefb555469d54","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,124,36,153,71,108,56,125,2,205,194,142,249,126,239,181,85,70,157,84]},"name":"The Complete Guide to Fasting_ Heal Your Body Through Intermitte","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
