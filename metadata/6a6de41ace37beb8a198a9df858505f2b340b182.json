Liesel scratches out a meager existence for herself by stealing when she encounters something she can&apos;t resist: books. With the help of her accordion-playing foster father, she learns to read and shares her stolen books with her neighbors during bombing raids - as well as with the Jewish man hidden in her basement before he is marched to Dachau.\r\n\r\nThis is an unforgettable story about the ability of books to feed the soul","last_updated":"2017-07-01T12:00:20.295Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a6de41ace37beb8a198a9df858505f2b340b182","dn":"The Book Thief by Markus Zusak epub RtR","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"6a6de41ace37beb8a198a9df858505f2b340b182","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,109,228,26,206,55,190,184,161,152,169,223,133,133,5,242,179,64,177,130]},"name":"The Book Thief by Markus Zusak epub RtR","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
