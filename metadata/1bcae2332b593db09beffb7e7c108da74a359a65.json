You have access to an array of parts to assemble fully-functional spacecraft that flies (or doesn&#x2019;t) based on realistic aerodynamic and orbital physics. Launch your Kerbal crew into orbit and beyond (while keeping them alive) to explore moons and planets in the Kerbol solar system, constructing bases and space stations to expand the reach of your expedition.\r\n\r\nKerbal Space Program features three gameplay modes. In Science Mode, perform space experiments to unlock new technology and advance the knowledge of Kerbalkind. In Career Mode, oversee every aspect of the space program, including construction, strategy, funding, upgrades, and more. In Sandbox, you are free to build any spacecraft you can think of, with all parts and technology in the game.\r\nKey Features\r\nBuild spaceships, rockets, and vehicles using any imaginable combination of parts, each with their own function that will affect the way your spacecraft behaves.\r\n\r\nTry out the many mods created by the Kerbal Space Program community!\r\n\r\nSYSTEM REQUIREMENTS\r\n-------------------\r\nWindows Mac OS X SteamOS + Linux\r\nMINIMUM:\r\nOS:Windows Vista SP1\r\nProcessor:Core 2 Duo\r\nMemory:3GB RAM\r\nGraphics:DX10 (SM 4.0) capable, 512MB VRAM\r\nHard Drive:4 GB HD space\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDED:\r\n------------\r\nOS:Windows 10 64 bit\r\nProcessor:Core i5\r\nMemory:4 GB RAM\r\nGraphics:DX10 (SM 4.0) capable, 1GB VRAM\r\nHard Drive:6 GB HD space\r\n64-BIT VERSION RECOMMENDED\r\n\r\n\r\n--Includes newest update v1.4.4.2215","last_updated":"2018-07-01T12:10:53.343Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:1bcae2332b593db09beffb7e7c108da74a359a65","dn":"Kerbal Space Program Making History REPACK v1.4.4.2215","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"1bcae2332b593db09beffb7e7c108da74a359a65","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,202,226,51,43,89,61,176,155,239,251,126,124,16,141,167,74,53,154,101]},"name":"Kerbal Space Program Making History REPACK v1.4.4.2215","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
