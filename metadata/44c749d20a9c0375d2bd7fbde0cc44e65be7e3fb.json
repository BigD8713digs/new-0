Why do we fear infrequent acts of terrorism more than far more common acts of violence? Why does a disease like Ebola, which killed only a handful of Americans, provoke panic whereas the flu - which kills tens of thousands each year - is dismissed with a yawn?\r\n\r\nJumping at Shadows is Sasha Abramsky&apos;s searing account of America&apos;s most dangerous epidemic: irrational fear. Taking readers on a dramatic journey through a divided nation, where everything from immigration to disease, gun control to health care has become fodder for fearmongers and conspiracists, he delivers an eye-popping analysis of our misconceptions about risk and threats. What emerges is a shocking portrait of a political and cultural landscape that is, increasingly, defined by our worst fears and rampant anxieties.\r\n\r\nUltimately, Abramsky shows that how we calculate risk and deal with fear can teach us a great deal about ourselves, exposing deeply ingrained strains of racism, classism, and xenophobia within our culture as well as our growing susceptibility to the toxic messages of demagogues.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-10-09T12:02:15.085Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:44c749d20a9c0375d2bd7fbde0cc44e65be7e3fb","dn":"Jumping at Shadows by Sasha Abramsky EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"44c749d20a9c0375d2bd7fbde0cc44e65be7e3fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,199,73,210,10,156,3,117,210,189,127,189,224,204,68,230,91,231,227,251]},"name":"Jumping at Shadows by Sasha Abramsky EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
