Dealing with complex forensic problems requires the use of dedicated tools, and even more importantly, the right strategies. In this book, you&apos;ll learn strategies and methods to deal with information stored on smartphones and tablets and see how to put the right tools to work.\r\nWe begin by helping you understand the concept of mobile devices as a source of valuable evidence. Throughout this book, you will explore strategies and &quot;plays&quot; and decide when to use each technique. We cover important techniques such as seizing techniques to shield the device, and acquisition techniques including physical acquisition (via a USB connection), logical acquisition via data backups, over-the-air acquisition. We also explore cloud analysis, evidence discovery and data analysis, tools for mobile forensics, and tools to help you discover and analyze evidence.\r\n\r\nAbout the Authors\r\nOleg Afonin Oleg Afonin is a researcher and an expert in digital forensics.
