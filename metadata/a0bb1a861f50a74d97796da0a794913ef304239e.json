The WhatsApp Latest Version that has been released on 10th November 2016 is WhatsApp 2.16.346 APK, and it has a whole set of new features added.\r\n\r\nThe most significant feature is that WhatsApp has launched the video calling feature in the recent version which is yet to be officially activated for many users in different countries.\r\nApart from that, it has introduced the SnapChat like filters where the user can doodle a pic with texts of different colors, add emojis to it before sending to another person.\r\nAlso, using the <a class=\"__cf_email__\" href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection\" data-cfemail=\"1cfe9c805cfe9c81\">[email&#xA0;protected]</a><script data-cfhash=\"f9e31\" type=\"text/javascript\">/* <![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName('script'),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute('data-cfhash'))return t[e]}();if(t&&(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute('data-cfemail')){for(e='',r='0x'+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+='%'+('0'+('0x'+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]> */</script> symbol, one can tag a person or a contact in the group conversation to address them.\r\nMinimum System Requirements of WhatsApp for PC\r\n\r\nThe minimum operating system that is needed to install WhatsApp for PC is Windows XP SP3 with a .net framework 2.0.\r\nYou should have the privilege of the administrator to use the user account.\r\nA minimum RAM of 2GB is required to install the WhatsApp PC.\r\nYou should be VGA compatible so that the installation is not interrupted.\r\n\r\n \r\nHow to Download WhatsApp for PC/Laptop?\r\n\r\nLet&#x2019;s address the question initially. Why does anyone want to download WhatsApp for PC instead of using it on the phone? If you have huge chunks of text to send and you can&#x2019;t do it on the mobile; you can use the PC version and send them up by typing from the keyboard. Also, the WhatsApp for PC version helps you to text while you&#x2019;re doing something else and gives you the ability to multi-task. In some cases, you&#x2019;re not officially allowed to use the phone in the office premises or the college premises; therefore you can then open the WhatsApp on PC and keep texting.\r\n\r\nThe five major methods used in WhatsApp PC download are:\r\n\r\nUsing the WhatsApp Web version.\r\nInstall WhatsApp on PC through Bluestacks Player.\r\nDownload WhatsApp for PC through Nox app player.\r\nWhatsApp Download for PC through Andyroid.\r\nWhatsApp for PC download through MEmu Emulator","last_updated":"2017-06-24T12:00:57.364Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:a0bb1a861f50a74d97796da0a794913ef304239e","dn":"WhatsApp on Windows XP,7,8,10 for PC (July) Final","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"a0bb1a861f50a74d97796da0a794913ef304239e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,187,26,134,31,80,167,77,151,121,109,160,167,148,145,62,243,4,35,158]},"name":"WhatsApp on Windows XP,7,8,10 for PC (July) Final","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
