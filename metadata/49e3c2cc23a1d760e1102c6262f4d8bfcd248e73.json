This team -- which includes Jason, the group&apos;s intense leader, and Ray, Jason&apos;s longtime confidant, along with loyal soldier Sonny and SEAL hopeful Clay -- trains, plans and executes some of the most dangerous, high-stakes missions and deploys for clandestine missions around the globe at a moment&apos;s notice. While serving their country is a worthy and rewarding cause, it can put a strain on the SEALs and their families, causing the guys look out for one another in the face of seemingly overwhelming odds, both on and off the job.\r\n\r\nFirst episode date: 27 September 2017\r\nNetwork: CBS\r\nCreated by: Benjamin Cavell\r\nGenre: Drama\r\nExecutive producers: Ed Redlich, Sarah Timberman, Carl Beverly, Christopher Chulack","last_updated":"2017-12-07T12:07:17.207Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:49e3c2cc23a1d760e1102c6262f4d8bfcd248e73","dn":"Seal.Team.S01E09.720p.HDTV.X264.[433MB]","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"49e3c2cc23a1d760e1102c6262f4d8bfcd248e73","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,227,194,204,35,161,215,96,225,16,44,98,98,244,216,191,205,36,142,115]},"name":"Seal.Team.S01E09.720p.HDTV.X264.[433MB]","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
