There is some mention of her distaste of Bath\r\nas a place of her liking and there may be other aspects too that suggest she is\r\nsomehow relating a story that mirrors her own lot in life in giving us the\r\ncharacter of &quot;Anne&quot; in this final of her novels.\r\n\r\nWhat is most interesting to me personally in this story is the theme that often\r\nis encountered from such writers in the contrasts between characters such as that\r\nof Anne versus that of Louisa Musgrove in what would be a suitable match for\r\nCaptain Wentworth&apos;s character in this tale.\r\n\r\nFor his own part, Captain Wentworth indicates he is seeking a woman who isn&apos;t\r\nfragile in her emotions. He wants a woman who &quot;wont be swayed&quot; he tells us.\r\n\r\nYet considering his own good nature and strength of great character, it would\r\nhardly do him justice to be saddled with such a disposition upon his own spirit.\r\nIn this regard, I think we are scripting for Captain Wentworth, an unwise\r\nposition on the matter - to his own honest interests, as he is in fact clearly\r\nbest served in life by staying close to the knitting instead of the likes of\r\nthe lovely Miss Louisa Musgrove.\r\n\r\nEnough said, perhaps! Enjoy the show, Jane Austen never fails to impress\r\nin old fashioned wit of the greatest of languages which English is!\r\n\r\nMichael Rizzo Chessman\r\n(moviesbyrizzo)","last_updated":"2018-08-22T12:10:22.508Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c7f36217884149605e123b8a527861dd65ac966","dn":"Persuasion (2007) Jane Austen 1080p H.264 (moviesbyrizzo) subs","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"2c7f36217884149605e123b8a527861dd65ac966","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,127,54,33,120,132,20,150,5,225,35,184,165,39,134,29,214,90,201,102]},"name":"Persuasion (2007) Jane Austen 1080p H.264 (moviesbyrizzo) subs","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
