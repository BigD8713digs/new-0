Harvard professors Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt have spent more than twenty years studying the breakdown of democracies in Europe and Latin America, and they believe the answer is yes. Democracy no longer ends with a bang--in a revolution or military coup--but with a whimper: the slow, steady weakening of critical institutions, such as the judiciary and the press, and the gradual erosion of long-standing political norms. The good news is that there are several exit ramps on the road to authoritarianism. The bad news is that, by electing Trump, we have already passed the first one.\r\n\r\nDrawing on decades of research and a wide range of historical and global examples, from 1930s Europe to contemporary Hungary, Turkey, and Venezuela, to the American South during Jim Crow, Levitsky and Ziblatt show how democracies die-and how ours can be saved.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-01-18T18:58:08.369Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:830675c4d8878ed7ca410bd91219f3eec4d35982","dn":"How Democracies Die by Steven Levitsky, Daniel Ziblatt EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"830675c4d8878ed7ca410bd91219f3eec4d35982","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,6,117,196,216,135,142,215,202,65,11,217,18,25,243,238,196,211,89,130]},"name":"How Democracies Die by Steven Levitsky, Daniel Ziblatt EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
