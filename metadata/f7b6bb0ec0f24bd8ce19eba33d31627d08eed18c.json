J. Arlidge EPUB\r\n\r\nThere is a sickness in the forest. First, it was the wild horses. Now it&apos;s innocent men and women, hunted down and murdered by a faceless figure. Lost in the darkness, they try to flee, they try to hide. In desperation, they call out for help. But there is no-one to hear their cries here....\r\n\r\nDI Helen Grace must face down a new nightmare. The arrow-ridden victims hang from the New Forest&apos;s ancient oaks, like pieces of strange fruit. Why are helpless holidaymakers being targeted in peak camping season? And what do their murders signify? Is a psychopath stalking the forest? Is there an occult element to the killings? Could the murders even be an offering to the Forest itself? Helen must walk into the darkness to discover the truth behind her most challenging, most macabre case yet.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-09-27T12:02:21.241Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:f7b6bb0ec0f24bd8ce19eba33d31627d08eed18c","dn":"Down to the Woods (Helen Grace, Book 8) by M.
