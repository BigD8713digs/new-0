Nobody appeared. Across the US government, the same thing happened: nothing.\r\nPeople don&apos;t notice when stuff goes right. That is the stuff government does. It manages everything that underpins our lives from funding free school meals, to policing rogue nuclear activity, to predicting extreme weather events. It steps in where private investment fears to tread, innovates and creates knowledge, assesses extreme long-term risk.\r\n\r\nGenre: Audiobooks &gt; Non-Fiction\r\n <a href=\"\nhttps://i.imgur.com/b5ckVTB.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://i.imgur.com/b5ckVTB.jpg</a>","last_updated":"2018-10-03T12:27:57.002Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:968f4db52668d9da801508d9a5c935af07f01acb","dn":"The Fifth Risk by Michael Lewis (.m4b)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"968f4db52668d9da801508d9a5c935af07f01acb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,143,77,181,38,104,217,218,128,21,8,217,165,201,53,175,7,240,26,203]},"name":"The Fifth Risk by Michael Lewis (.m4b)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
