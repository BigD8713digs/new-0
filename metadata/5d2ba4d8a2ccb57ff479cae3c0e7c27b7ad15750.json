Levin comes a searing plea for a return to America&apos;s most sacred values.\r\n\r\nIn Rediscovering Americanism, Mark R. Levin revisits the founders&apos; warnings about the perils of overreach by the federal government and concludes that the men who created our country would be outraged and disappointed to see where we&apos;ve ended up.\r\n\r\nLevin returns to the impassioned question he&apos;s explored in each of his best-selling books: How do we save our exceptional country? Because our values are in such a precarious state, he argues that a restoration to the essential truths on which our country was founded has never been more urgent. Understanding these principles, in Levin&apos;s words, can &quot;serve as the antidote to tyrannical regimes and governments&quot;. Rediscovering Americanism is not an exercise in nostalgia but an appeal to his fellow citizens to reverse course.\r\n\r\nThis essential book brings Levin&apos;s celebrated, sophisticated analysis to the troubling question of America&apos;s future and reminds us what we must restore for the sake of our children and our children&apos;s children.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-08-10T12:00:31.509Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d2ba4d8a2ccb57ff479cae3c0e7c27b7ad15750","dn":"Rediscovering Americanism_ And the Tyranny of Progressivism by M","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"5d2ba4d8a2ccb57ff479cae3c0e7c27b7ad15750","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,43,164,216,162,204,181,127,244,121,202,227,192,231,194,123,122,209,87,80]},"name":"Rediscovering Americanism_ And the Tyranny of Progressivism by M","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
