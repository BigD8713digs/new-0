This new version contains many exciting new features, enhancements and bugfixes. Highlights in this release include performance improvements for some graphics cards and scripting, and volumetric grass that reacts to helicopter rotor downwash. Founded in 1997, FlightGear is developed by a worldwide group of volunteers, brought together by a shared ambition to create the most realistic flight simulator possible that is free to use, modify and distribute. FlightGear is used all over the world by desktop flight simulator enthusiasts, for research in universities and for interactive exhibits in museums.\r\n\r\nFlightGear features more than 400 aircraft, a worldwide scenery database, a multiplayer environment, detailed sky modelling, a flexible and open aircraft modelling system, varied networking options, multiple display support, a powerful scripting language and an open architecture. Best of all, being open-source, the simulator is owned by the community and everyone is encouraged to contribute.\r\n\r\nFlightGear - Fly Free! \r\n <a href=\"\nhttp://www.flightgear.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttp://www.flightgear.org/</a>","last_updated":"2017-12-28T12:05:29.402Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0e5d56917e462b649245fa17677c8a35e171274","dn":"FlightGear Flight Simulator v2017.3.1 for Windows","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"d0e5d56917e462b649245fa17677c8a35e171274","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,229,213,105,23,228,98,182,73,36,95,161,118,119,200,163,94,23,18,116]},"name":"FlightGear Flight Simulator v2017.3.1 for Windows","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
