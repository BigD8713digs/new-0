The label&apos;s inability to introduce any of the group&apos;s groundbreaking albums to a significantly wider audience certainly didn&apos;t sit well with ST main man Mike Muir, who decided to run through the motions while being as gratuitously offensive as possible on this contractually necessary release. \r\nAfter a scathing though mercifully short rant called &quot;Invocation&quot; (a similarly goofy outro called &quot;Benediction&quot; closes the proceedings), the band launches into the self-explanatory &quot;Don&apos;t Give a Fuck!,&quot; &quot;No Fuck&apos;n Problem,&quot; &quot;Suicyco Muthafucka,&quot; and &quot;Fucked Up Just Right!&quot; Gee, think they were trying to piss someone off at the label? \r\nBut while they pursue a noticeable return to ST&apos;s thrashcore roots after the overtly traditional power metal strains of 1992&apos;s The Art of Rebellion, tracks like &quot;No Bullshit&quot; and &quot;Love Vs. Loneliness&quot; (replete with Muir&apos;s trademark antisocial diatribes) tend to sound dated and tired. The first at least benefits from lead guitarist Rocky George&apos;s typically fluid and inventive soloing, while the second still qualifies as one of the album&apos;s best moments thanks to rhythm guitarist Mike Clark&apos;s powerful riffs. When they occur, the few surprises (as in the quirky noise fest of &quot;What Else Could I Do?&quot;) are just that: different, but not necessarily great music. \r\nAnd it was certainly not surprising to see the band splinter into a million pieces soon after releasing this album.
