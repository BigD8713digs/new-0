Nor is there a hint of any possible motive for the attack.\r\n\r\nEnter Harper Brown. An agent of the Defense Intelligence Agency, she orders Decker to back off the case. The murder is part of an open DIA investigation, one so classified that Decker and his team aren&apos;t cleared for it.\r\n\r\nBut they learn that the DIA believes solving the murder is now a matter of urgent national security. Critical information may have been leaked to a hostile government - or, worse, an international terrorist group - and an attack may be imminent.\r\n\r\nDecker&apos;s never been one to follow the rules, especially with the stakes so high. Forced into an uneasy alliance with Agent Brown, Decker remains laser focused on only one goal: solving the case before it&apos;s too late","last_updated":"2017-12-16T12:06:15.342Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:20f38b0504c95f593820cc3cf91ce9e6dc430cdc","dn":"The Fix - David Baldacci","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"20f38b0504c95f593820cc3cf91ce9e6dc430cdc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,243,139,5,4,201,95,89,56,32,204,60,249,28,233,230,220,67,12,220]},"name":"The Fix - David Baldacci","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
