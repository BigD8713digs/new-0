While Germany is generally regarded as the senior power, Christian Goeschel demonstrates just how much history has underrepresented Mussolini&#x2019;s influence on his German ally. \r\n\r\nIn this highly readable book, Goeschel, a scholar of twentieth-century Germany and Italy, revisits all of Mussolini and Hitler&#x2019;s key meetings and asks how these meetings constructed a powerful image of a strong Fascist-Nazi relationship that still resonates with the general public. His portrait of Mussolini draws on sources ranging beyond political history to reveal a leader who, at times, shaped Hitler&#x2019;s decisions and was not the gullible buffoon he&apos;s often portrayed as. The first comprehensive study of the Mussolini-Hitler relationship, this book is a must-read for scholars and anyone interested in the history of European fascism, World War II, or political leadership.\r\n\r\nGenre: Non-Fiction &gt; History","last_updated":"2018-09-29T13:26:33.138Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:ddf5b32081163a67e6b75fd51dc09cc663bd82bd","dn":"Mussolini and Hitler by Christian Goeschel (.epub)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"ddf5b32081163a67e6b75fd51dc09cc663bd82bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,245,179,32,129,22,58,103,230,183,95,213,29,192,156,198,99,189,130,189]},"name":"Mussolini and Hitler by Christian Goeschel (.epub)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
