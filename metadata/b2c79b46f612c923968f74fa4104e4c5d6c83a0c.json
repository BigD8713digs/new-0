We are committed to sourcing the best advice, tips, and inspiration available, so that our readers, both amateur and professional photographers alike, can benefit from and enjoy our magazine.\r\n\r\nAt Wildlife Photographic we are hugely passionate about wildlife, and in particular the beauty and wonder we can see and feel when viewing images of various wild animals. However we also feel a real sense of responsibility to help the various organisations who work to conserve and restore, the habitats of various wild animals.  We therefore aim to provide an additional platform for these organisations to spread the word of the amazing, and crucial, work that they do","last_updated":"2017-07-28T12:02:02.974Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:b2c79b46f612c923968f74fa4104e4c5d6c83a0c","dn":"Wildlife Photographic - Issue 25 - July-August 2017 - PDF - zeke","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"b2c79b46f612c923968f74fa4104e4c5d6c83a0c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,199,155,70,246,18,201,35,150,143,116,250,65,4,228,197,214,200,58,12]},"name":"Wildlife Photographic - Issue 25 - July-August 2017 - PDF - zeke","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
