A true virtuoso, Tash was soon selling out major theatres &amp; arenas globally and playing at the world&#x2019;s biggest festivals - no mean feat for an artist who just a year before was recording songs on a go pro in a bedroom. &#x2028; Since Tash&#x2019;s grandfather gifted a guitar at the age of three, the self-taught artist quickly developed a unique style that has people lining up to see around the world. Tash has mastered over 15 instruments, vocals that shine with a magical quality and a live show that needs to be seen to be believed. &#x2028; The one-person powerhouse started out playing open mic nights on a fake id and busking on the streets of Melbourne, Australia. &#x2028; Recent accolades include over 200M streams of the Notion EP, topping the iTunes chart in multiple countries, &#x2018;Jungle&#x2019; coming in at #3 in triple j&#x2019;s Hottest 100, achieving gold sales for the Notion EP and platinum sales for single &#x2018;Jungle&#x2019; which also featured in FIFA 18, winning the prestigious unearthed j award, 4x Aria award nominations, multiple APRA nominations and most recently playing stand out sets at Coachella &amp; Lollapalooza 2018. &#x2028; On August 31 Tash&#x2019;s highly anticipated debut album, &#x2018;Flow State&#x2019; will be released with the album&#x2019;s key singles, &#x2018;Salvation&#x2019; and &apos;Harvest Love&apos; out now","last_updated":"2018-08-26T12:10:26.705Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:308261ab9c074ff475d2071cd6c63dffd9e6690d","dn":"Tash Sultana - Collection (2016-2018) MP3 (320kbps) [DR]","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"308261ab9c074ff475d2071cd6c63dffd9e6690d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,130,97,171,156,7,79,244,117,210,7,28,214,198,61,255,217,230,105,13]},"name":"Tash Sultana - Collection (2016-2018) MP3 (320kbps) [DR]","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
