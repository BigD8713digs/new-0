But despite the sheer volume of literature produced during the &#x2018;war on terror&#x2019; period, few studies have sought to consider the way this entity has been represented within the news media. The BBC, the War on Terror and the Discursive Construction of Al-Qaeda addresses this significant gap in knowledge by providing an original and much needed assessment of the various strategies used to depict &#x2018;al-Qaeda&#x2019;, and thus make it meaningful for British television audiences. Drawing on the work of French philosopher Michel Foucault, and focusing on Britain&#x2019;s most watched and trusted news programme, the BBC&#x2019;s flagship &#x2018;News at Ten&#x2019; bulletin, the book provides insight into both the visual and verbal nature of these representations and the way they have shifted over the course of a ten-year period, while also shedding light upon the broader political and social consequences of the BBC&#x2019;s portrayals. In doing so, the book not only helps to develop a deeper understanding of the complexity of the BBC&#x2019;s representations, and their various shifts and transformations, but also details the process through which &#x2018;al-Qaeda&#x2019; has been pieced together from a range of cultural parts. And how, ultimately, the dominant mode of representation used to portray this entity is one that closely resembles Britain&#x2019;s own, diverse multicultural &#x2018;self&#x2019;","last_updated":"2018-07-11T12:08:48.103Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:f4dc6bbc09366d8e825d09d16d3e755f7b6ca2dd","dn":"The BBC, The 'War on Terror' and the Discursive Construction of ","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"f4dc6bbc09366d8e825d09d16d3e755f7b6ca2dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,220,107,188,9,54,109,142,130,93,9,209,109,62,117,95,123,108,162,221]},"name":"The BBC, The 'War on Terror' and the Discursive Construction of ","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
