Ending price: US $2,025) and is now in circulation.\r\n\r\nThe session took place at Olympic Studios in London (March 17th, 1970). The first track is an early mix of the track that opened the Love album &quot;False Start&quot;. Jimi puts in some vocals on the two brief and raggedy takes of &quot;Ezy Ryder&quot;. Finally there is a nice ten minute jam with all concerned where Jimi exchanges solos and riffs with Gary Rowles.\r\nInvited by Love&apos;s Arthur Lee to contribute to his band&apos;s album, Hendrix returned to Olympic Studios, the recording facility where he had recorded Are You Experienced and Axis: Bold As Love. Hendrix joined Love in recording &quot;The Everlasting First&quot;, which came out in December of 1970 as part of Love&apos;s False Start. The three musicians recorded sixteen takes of before a basic track met Lee&apos;s approval. Two clean, complete takes of Hendrix&apos;s own &quot;Ezy Rider&quot; followed next. Hendrix then took part in an extended instrumental jam session before departing.\r\n\r\nTracklist\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n01 Everlasting.\r\n02 Easy Rider 1\r\n03 Easy Rider 2.\r\n04 Jam.\r\n\r\nIm sure you will like it better than the last one I shared\r\n\r\n\r\nPlayers\r\n\r\nLove is:\r\nArthur Lee - lead vocals / rhythm guitar\r\nGary Rowles - lead guitar\r\nFrank Fayad - bass\r\nGeorge Suranovich - drums\r\nwith:\r\nJimi Hendrix - vocals / guitar\r\nRemi Kabaka - percussion, drums on Loon\r\nLasisi Amao - percussionist and conga player on Loon aka Jam","last_updated":"2017-05-27T08:54:43.278Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d885492f092416ed6c770697438a12d35bea771","dn":"Jimi Hendrix &amp; Love - Blue Thumb Acetate FLAC ak","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"3d885492f092416ed6c770697438a12d35bea771","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,136,84,146,240,146,65,110,214,199,112,105,116,56,161,45,53,190,167,113]},"name":"Jimi Hendrix &amp; Love - Blue Thumb Acetate FLAC ak","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
