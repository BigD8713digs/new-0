Yurt: Invitation\r\n\r\nLaunching the latest batch of arcana from the Brad Rose&apos;s Digitalis imprint is the debut release by the unpronounceable Kyrzyg (presumably after Kyrzygstan). They are a bay area improvisational quartet comprising Tom Carter (Charalambides), Loren Chasse (The Blithe Sons, Thuja), Christine Boepple (Skygreen Leopards), and Robert Horton (Broken Mask, Infinite Article). One wonders whether to expect some plinking away in a forest on acoustic instruments guided by the Jeweled Antler side of the family tree, some higher key drone-psych-skronk incursions guided by Carter and Horton&apos;s leanings, or something altogether outside these axes. In fast, much like the recent Spiral Joy Band release on VHF, the six tracks on the Kyrgyz CD make extensive use of Eastern percussion, tape loops, and the creation of drones by various bowed instruments to create a temple architecture for journeying into cobwebbed regions of the unconscious, as well as mapping out a psychic travelogue through mystical Central Asian regions.  The sprawling opener, &apos; Kyrgyz (Crown of the Yurt, Window to Heaven)&apos; hold true to a Central Asian theme as one imagines this sound swirling around one of the region&apos;s typical circular dwelling places (Yurt, natch) and exiting like opium smoke through the aged and much-stained shangrak - apex of the dwelling, source of light and documenter of generations. - Tony Dale, terrascope.co.uk","last_updated":"2017-06-17T12:01:11.987Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6c37207c020ff19343da013c5f4e1b50b4ca779","dn":"Kyrgyz 2006 Kyrgyz","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"e6c37207c020ff19343da013c5f4e1b50b4ca779","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,195,114,7,192,32,255,25,52,61,160,19,197,244,225,181,11,76,167,121]},"name":"Kyrgyz 2006 Kyrgyz","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
