Jamal Malik (Dev Patel) may not have a penny to his name, but that could all change in a matter of hours. He&apos;s one question away from taking the top prize on India&apos;s most popular television game show, but as with everything else in Jamal&apos;s life, it isn&apos;t going to be easy. Arrested by police under suspicion of cheating, Jamal is interrogated by the authorities. The police simply can&apos;t believe that a common &quot;slumdog&quot; could possibly possess the knowledge to get this far in the game, and in order to convince them of how he gained such knowledge, Jamal begins reflecting back on his childhood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTARS.........: Dev Patel, Freida Pinto, Saurabh Shukla\r\nDIRECTOR......: Danny Boyle, Loveleen Tandan\r\nWRITERS.......: Simon Beaufoy, Vikas Swarup\r\nGENRE.........: Drama, Romance\r\nMETASCORE.....: 86/100\r\nTOMATOMETER...: 92\r\nIMDB RATING...: 8.0/10  693,565 votes\r\nIMDB LINK.....: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1010048\r\nRUNTIME.......: 2h 0mn\r\nSIZE..........: 4.27GB\r\nVIDEO CODEC...: HEVC (<a href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection\" class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"fcb19d9592bcb0c8\">[email&#xA0;protected]</a>)\r\nBITRATE.......: 4250 Kbps (2-Pass)\r\nRESOLUTION....: 1920x1080\r\nASPECT RATIO..: 2.39:1\r\nFRAMERATE.....: 23.976 fps\r\nAUDIO.........: English E-AC3 5.1 640 kbps\r\nAUDIO.........: Commentary by Danny Boyle &amp; Dev Patel\r\nAUDIO.........: Commentary by Christian Colson &amp; Simon Beaufoy\r\nSUBTITLES.....: ENG, SPA \r\nCHAPTERS......: Yes\r\nSOURCE........: Blu Ray\r\nENCODED BY....: Sartre\r\nENCODE DATE...: 2017-11-9\r\n\r\n\r\nI did this before in x264... here&apos;s a new encode in HEVC, slightly better","last_updated":"2017-12-10T12:03:17.690Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:1da0fd3d12a4d65ba74d6d79b0f6f800f4c023e9","dn":"Slumdog.Millionaire.2008.1080p.BluRay.HEVC.EAC3-SARTRE","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"1da0fd3d12a4d65ba74d6d79b0f6f800f4c023e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,160,253,61,18,164,214,91,167,77,109,121,176,246,248,0,244,192,35,233]},"name":"Slumdog.Millionaire.2008.1080p.BluRay.HEVC.EAC3-SARTRE","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
