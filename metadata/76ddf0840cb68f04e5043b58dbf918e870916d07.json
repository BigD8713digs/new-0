The voyage of Continent Australia after it breaks away from Antarctica 50 million years ago with its raft of Gondwanaland flora and fauna and begins its journey north towards the equator.\r\n\r\nThe voyage of Joseph Banks on the Endeavour who with Daniel Solander became the first trained naturalists to describe the unique flora and fauna of Continent Australia that had evolved during its 30 million years of isolation.\r\n\r\nThe voyage of Charles Darwin on the Beagle, who after his observations in South America and the Galapagos Islands, sat on the banks of the Coxs River in New South Wales and tried to rationalize his belief in the idea of biblical creation and understand the origin of species.\r\n\r\nThe voyage of Alfred Russel Wallace, who realized that the Lombok Strait in Indonesia represents the biogeographical boundary between the fauna of Asia and those of Australasia. On the Asian side are elephants, tigers, primates and specific birds. On the Australasian side are marsupials such as the possum-like cuscus and the Aru wallaby, as well as birds specific to Australia such as white cockatoos, brush turkeys and the spectacular Birds of Paradise. It was tectonic plate movement that brought these disparate worlds together and it was Alfred Russel Wallace&apos;s &apos;Letter from Ternate&apos; that forced Charles Darwin to finally publish his landmark work &apos;On the Origin of Species&apos;.\r\n\r\nAbout the author <a href=\"\nhttps://s8.postimg.org/tthz12ck5/Burnet.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://s8.postimg.org/tthz12ck5/Burnet.jpg</a>\r\nIan Burnet has spent more than thirty years, living, working and travelling in the Indonesian archipelago in his professional career.\r\nFascinated by the history of the archipelago, he thought the story of the spice trade from the tiny islands of Ternate and Tidore, and their effect on world history had to be told. His book &apos;Spice Islands&apos; has been described as &quot;a triumph of passion and scholarship&quot;\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\nAcknowledgments 7\r\nPrologue 8\r\n1 The Voyage of Continent Australia 11\r\n2 Joseph Banks &#x2013; The Voyage of the Endeavour 21\r\n3 Joseph Banks &#x2013; In Australia 32\r\n4 Sir Joseph Banks &#x2013; In London 45\r\n5 Charles Darwin &#x2013; The Early Years 54\r\n6 Charles Darwin &#x2013; The Voyage of the Beagle 65\r\n7 Charles Darwin &#x2013; In Australia 81\r\n8 Charles Darwin &#x2013; In London 93\r\n9 Alfred Russel Wallace &#x2013; The Early Years 100\r\n10 Alfred Russel Wallace &#x2013; The Voyages on the Amazon 107\r\n11 Charles Darwin &#x2013; At Down House 118\r\n12 Alfred Russel Wallace &#x2013; In Singapore and Borneo 126\r\n13 Where Australia Collides with Asia 136\r\n14 Alfred Russel Wallace &#x2013; The Voyage to the Aru Islands 142\r\n15 Alfred Russel Wallace &#x2013; The &#x2018;Letter from Ternate&#x2019; 159\r\n16 Alfred Russel Wallace &#x2013; The Voyage to Waigeo 166\r\n17 Charles Darwin &#x2013; On the Origin of Species 173\r\n18 Alfred Russel Wallace &#x2013; The Return to England 183\r\nEpilogue 192\r\nAuthor&#x2019;s Note 197\r\nBibliography 199\r\nIndex 202\r\n <a href=\"\nhttps://s8.postimg.org/sr7sihr5x/Where_Australia_Collides_with_Asia.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://s8.postimg.org/sr7sihr5x/Where_Australia_Collides_with_Asia.jpg</a>","last_updated":"2017-11-19T12:04:44.541Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:76ddf0840cb68f04e5043b58dbf918e870916d07","dn":"Where Australia Collides with Asia (gnv64)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"76ddf0840cb68f04e5043b58dbf918e870916d07","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,221,240,132,12,182,143,4,229,4,59,88,219,249,24,232,112,145,109,7]},"name":"Where Australia Collides with Asia (gnv64)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
