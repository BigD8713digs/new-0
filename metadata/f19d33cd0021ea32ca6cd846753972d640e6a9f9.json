This DVD appears unprotected and region code free for all applications and the Windows operating system as well. AnyDVD works in the background to automatically remove the copy protection of a DVD movie as soon as it&#x2019;s inserted into the drive, allowing you then to backup the movie using a DVD backup tool such as CloneDVD and CloneDVD mobile. \r\n\r\n\r\nFEATURES - \r\nAnyDVD HD works in the background to automatically and transparently enable read access of the contents of a movie DVD or Blu-ray as soon as it&apos;s inserted into the drive. The DVD/Blu-ray will become useable to your windows operating system and all programs on your computer, such as DVD/Blu-ray backup software like CloneDVD, CloneBD and others, then supporting any DVD or Blu-ray. AnyDVD HD optionally disables RPC region codes, thereby making the movie region free and comfortably viewable on any DVD/Blu-ray player and with any DVD/Blu-ray playback software. \r\n\r\nAnyDVD HD is capable of disabling unwanted movie features such as forced subtitles, forced delays, and no-skip marks, giving you full control over your movie experience. It also allows you to launch an external application whenever you insert or remove a disc, and prevents unwanted software from automatically launching when you insert a video DVD. \r\n\r\nYou can control the drive speed of your DVD drive, allowing you to reduce the noise level when watching movies on your PC. You can even adjust the display frequency of your monitor for both NTSC and PAL displays. \r\n\r\nAnyDVD HD doesn&apos;t just stop at DVD&apos;s or Blu-ray&apos;s, it also fixes audio cd&apos;s to allow you to play and use them","last_updated":"2017-07-05T12:00:48.343Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:f19d33cd0021ea32ca6cd846753972d640e6a9f9","dn":"RedFox AnyDVD HD 8.1.6.0 Final   Patch [CracksNow]","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"f19d33cd0021ea32ca6cd846753972d640e6a9f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,157,51,205,0,33,234,50,202,108,216,70,117,57,114,214,64,230,169,249]},"name":"RedFox AnyDVD HD 8.1.6.0 Final   Patch [CracksNow]","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
