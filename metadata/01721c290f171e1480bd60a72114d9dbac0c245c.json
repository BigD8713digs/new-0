With characteristic wit, lucidity, and insight, Pinker argues that the dogma that the mind has no innate traits - a doctrine held by many intellectuals during the past century - denies our common humanity and our individual preferences, replaces objective analyses of social problems with feel-good slogans, and distorts our understanding of politics, violence, parenting, and the arts.\r\n\r\nInjecting calm and rationality into debates that are notorious for ax-grinding and mud-slinging, Pinker shows the importance of an honest acknowledgment of human nature based on science and common sense.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-10-09T12:01:02.679Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:01721c290f171e1480bd60a72114d9dbac0c245c","dn":"The Blank Slate by Steven Pinker EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"01721c290f171e1480bd60a72114d9dbac0c245c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,114,28,41,15,23,30,20,128,189,96,167,33,20,217,219,172,12,36,92]},"name":"The Blank Slate by Steven Pinker EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
