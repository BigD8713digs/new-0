Through her gorgeous reimagining of fairytale classics and spellbinding original tales, she dismantles the old-fashioned tropes that have been ingrained in our minds. In this book, gone are the docile women and male saviors. Instead, lines blur between heroes and villains. You will meet fearless princesses, a new kind of wolf lurking in the concrete jungle, and an independent Gretel who can bring down monsters on her own. \r\n\r\nFierce Fairytales is an empowering collection of poems and stories for a new generation. \r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-10-13T12:27:02.634Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:52837e19980c609b5a55c1b8a487ab3dc4e8e45c","dn":"Fierce Fairytales by Nikita Gill EPUB ","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"52837e19980c609b5a55c1b8a487ab3dc4e8e45c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,131,126,25,152,12,96,155,90,85,193,184,164,135,171,61,196,232,228,92]},"name":"Fierce Fairytales by Nikita Gill EPUB ","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
