What can big data on fossils reveal about farming&apos;s problematic role in human evolution? How can simple geometric comparisons of skull and pelvic fossils suggest an origin to our social nature?\r\n\r\nIn Close Encounters with Humankind, paleoanthropologist Sang-Hee Lee explores some of our biggest evolutionary questions from unexpected new angles.
