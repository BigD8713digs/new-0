Davis wrote most of this book while staying at Beauvoir along the Mississippi Gulf Coast near Biloxi, Mississippi.\r\n\r\nThe book is much less a Davis memoir than an articulation of the secession argument. In Davis&apos; earlier work, The Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government, he had written what is probably the most thorough exegesis of the compact theory of the United States Constitution in existence.\r\n\r\nStill concerned that people might not understand the compact theory of the Constitution, he wrote A Short History of the Confederate States of America shortly before his death.\r\n\r\nJefferson Finis Davis (1808 &#x2013; 1889) was an American politician who served as the President of the Confederate States from 1861 to 1865. He was the 23rd United States Secretary of War, serving under U.S. President Franklin Pierce from 1853 to 1857","last_updated":"2017-09-23T12:00:50.854Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:35866c12717a6eaabf8fd31711012d8d3563544d","dn":"A Short History Of The Confederate States Of America/Jefferson D","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"35866c12717a6eaabf8fd31711012d8d3563544d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,134,108,18,113,122,110,170,191,143,211,23,17,1,45,141,53,99,84,77]},"name":"A Short History Of The Confederate States Of America/Jefferson D","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
