The authors systematically compare the two approaches using applied fractional calculus. Stability theory in fractional order controllers design is also analysed.\r\n\r\n Presents material suitable for a variety of real-world applications, including hard disk drives, vehicular controls, robot control and micropositioners in DNA microarray analysis\r\nIncludes extensive experimental results from both lab bench level tests and industrial level, mass-production-ready implementations\r\nCovers detailed derivations and numerical simulations for each case\r\nDiscusses feasible design specifications, ideal for practicing engineers\r\nThe book also covers key topics including: fractional order disturbance cancellation and adaptive learning control studies for external disturbances; optimization approaches for nonlinear system control and design schemes with backlash and friction. Illustrations and experimental validations are included for each of the proposed control schemes to enable readers to develop a clear understanding of the approaches covered, and move on to apply them in real-world scenarios","last_updated":"2017-06-08T12:05:08.032Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:2aa8b51e7fef534c8131c66a4e77778330b70c13","dn":"Fractional Order Motion Controls","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"2aa8b51e7fef534c8131c66a4e77778330b70c13","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,168,181,30,127,239,83,76,129,49,198,106,78,119,119,131,48,183,12,19]},"name":"Fractional Order Motion Controls","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
