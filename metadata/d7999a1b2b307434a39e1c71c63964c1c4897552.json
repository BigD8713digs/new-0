That wrinkles are embarrassing, and old people useless. Author and activist Ashton Applewhite believed them too until she realized where this prejudice comes from and the damage it does. Lively, funny, and deeply researched, This Chair Rocks traces Applewhite&apos;s journey from apprehensive boomer to pro-aging radical, and in the process debunks myth after myth about late life.\r\n\r\nThe book explains the roots of ageism in history and in our own age denial and how it divides and debases, examines how ageist myths and stereotypes cripple the way our brains and bodies function, looks at ageism in the workplace and the bedroom, exposes the cost of the all-American myth of independence, critiques the portrayal of olders as burdens to society, describes what an all-age-friendly world would look like, and concludes with a rousing call to action.\r\n\r\nIt&apos;s time to create a world of age equality by making discrimination on the basis of age as unacceptable as any other kind. Whether you&apos;re older or hoping to get there, this book will shake you by the shoulders, cheer you up, make you mad, and change the way you see the rest of your life. Age pride!\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-01-01T12:06:08.514Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:d7999a1b2b307434a39e1c71c63964c1c4897552","dn":"This Chair Rocks by Ashton Applewhite EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"d7999a1b2b307434a39e1c71c63964c1c4897552","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,153,154,27,43,48,116,52,163,158,28,113,198,57,100,193,196,137,117,82]},"name":"This Chair Rocks by Ashton Applewhite EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
