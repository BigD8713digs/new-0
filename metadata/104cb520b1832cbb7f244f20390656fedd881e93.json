Jesus would be a fraud since He frequently predicted His own Resurrection, even designating it as His sign for an unbelieving world. Skeptics and critics understand the magnitude of the Resurrection, and they have developed numerous theories in their desperate attempts to explain away the wealth of evidence. The early Christians focused uniquely on Christ&apos;s conquering of death. In Defense of Easter is a resource that examines: - How history and archaeology support the Resurrection - Why skeptical explanations come up short - How the Resurrection provides hope and comfort - Whether Easter is a pagan holiday \r\n\r\nPlease seed.
