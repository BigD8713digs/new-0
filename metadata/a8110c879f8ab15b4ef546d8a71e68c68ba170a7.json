Rules are strictly enforced, from the aircraft carrier&#x2019;s captain down to the lowliest young deckhand. But the men and the brides will find their lives intertwined despite the Navy&#x2019;s ironclad sanctions. And for Frances Mackenzie, the complicated young woman whose past comes back to haunt her far from home, the journey will change her life in ways she never could have predicted - forever.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-11-07T12:02:48.551Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8110c879f8ab15b4ef546d8a71e68c68ba170a7","dn":"The Ship of Brides by Jojo Moyes EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"a8110c879f8ab15b4ef546d8a71e68c68ba170a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,17,12,135,159,138,177,91,78,245,70,216,167,30,104,198,139,161,112,167]},"name":"The Ship of Brides by Jojo Moyes EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
