Floyd Abrams, a noted lawyer and award-winning legal scholar specializing in First Amendment issues, examines the degree to which American law protects free speech more often, more intensely, and more controversially than is the case anywhere else in the world, including democratic nations such as Canada and England. In this lively, powerful, and provocative work, the author addresses legal issues from the adoption of the Bill of Rights through recent cases such as Citizens United. He also examines the repeated conflicts between claims of free speech and those of national security occasioned by the publication of classified material such as was contained in the Pentagon Papers and was made public by WikiLeaks and Edward Snowden.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-08-12T12:00:22.210Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:68619bb5dfe906260b3b4260e08a82102c91ec52","dn":"The Soul of the First Amendment by Floyd Abrams ePUB MOBI eBOOK-","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"68619bb5dfe906260b3b4260e08a82102c91ec52","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,97,155,181,223,233,6,38,11,59,66,96,224,138,130,16,44,145,236,82]},"name":"The Soul of the First Amendment by Floyd Abrams ePUB MOBI eBOOK-","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
