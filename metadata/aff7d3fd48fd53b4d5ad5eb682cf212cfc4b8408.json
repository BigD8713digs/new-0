Harris EPUB\r\n\r\nI am as brown as brown can be, \r\nAnd my eyes as black as sloe; \r\nI am as brisk as brisk can be, \r\nAnd wild as forest doe. \r\n(The Child Ballads, 295)\r\n\r\nSo begins a beautiful tale of love, loss and revenge. Following the seasons, A Pocketful of Crows balances youth and age, wisdom and passion, and draws on nature and folklore to weave a stunning modern mythology around a nameless wild girl.\r\n\r\nOnly love could draw her into the world of named, tamed things. And it seems only revenge will be powerful enough to let her escape.\r\n\r\nThis is a stunning and original modern fairy tale.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-02-05T12:04:29.222Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:aff7d3fd48fd53b4d5ad5eb682cf212cfc4b8408","dn":"A Pocketful of Crows by Joanne M.
