It was in Vienna that the failed artist Adolf Hitler kept daubing watercolors and spouting tirades at fellow drifters in a flophouse. Here, Archduke Franz Ferdinand had a troubled audience with Emperor Franz Joseph - and soon the bullet that killed the archduke would set off the Great War that would kill 10 million more.\r\n\r\nWith luminous prose that has twice made him a finalist for the National Book Award, Frederic Morton evokes the opulent, elegant, incomparable sunset metropolis - Vienna on the brink of cataclysm.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-06-16T12:12:31.695Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d6702b4040a4a9de0e76b10b651589a0f7e8630","dn":"Thunder at Twilight: Vienna 1913, 1914 by Frederic Morton EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"8d6702b4040a4a9de0e76b10b651589a0f7e8630","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,103,2,180,4,10,74,157,224,231,107,16,182,81,88,154,15,126,134,48]},"name":"Thunder at Twilight: Vienna 1913, 1914 by Frederic Morton EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
