A relentless serial killer is stalking the streets of the San Francisco Bay Area, leaving citizens locked into a constant state of panic, and baffled authorities scrambling for clues. Though the killer sadistically mocks the detectives by leaving a series of perplexing ciphers and menacing letters at the crime scenes, the investigation quickly flatlines when none of the evidence yields any solid leads. As two detectives remain steadfast in their devotion to bringing the elusive killer to justice, they soon find that the madman has control not only over their careers, but their very lives as well. \r\n\r\nThe second commentary features actors Jake Gyllenhaal and Robert Downey Jr., producer Brad Fischer, writer James Vanderbilt, and crime author James Ellroy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTARS.........: Jake Gyllenhaal, Robert Downey Jr., Mark Ruffalo\r\nDIRECTOR......: David Fincher\r\nWRITERS.......: James Vanderbilt, Robert Graysmith\r\nGENRE.........: Crime, Drama, History\r\nMETASCORE.....: 78\r\nTOMATOMETER...: 90\r\nIMDB RATING...: 7.7/10  349,145 votes\r\nIMDB LINK.....: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0443706\r\nRUNTIME.......: 2h 42mn\r\nSIZE..........: 4.34 GB\r\nVIDEO CODEC...: HEVC (<a href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection\" class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"e2af838b8cd3d2a2aed6\">[email&#xA0;protected]</a>)\r\nBITRATE.......: 3000 Kbps (2-pass)\r\nRESOLUTION....: 1920x800\r\nASPECT RATIO..: 2.40:1\r\nFRAMERATE.....: 23.976 fps\r\nAUDIO1........: English E-AC3 5.1 640kbps\r\nAUDIO2........: Commentary by David Fincher\r\nAUDIO3........: Commentary with cast, producers and writers\r\nSUBTITLES.....: ENG, FRE, SPA\r\nCHAPTERS......: Yes\r\nSOURCE........: US Blu Ray Remux\r\nENCODED BY....: Sartre\r\nENCODE DATE...: 2017-12-11\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was shot on digital so it looks pretty flat","last_updated":"2017-12-13T12:04:25.474Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:f968a2b4ae80332104152a33778e7d82a73d2259","dn":"Zodiac.2007.DC.1080p.BluRay.10Bit.HEVC.EAC3-SARTRE","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"f968a2b4ae80332104152a33778e7d82a73d2259","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,104,162,180,174,128,51,33,4,21,42,51,119,142,125,130,167,61,34,89]},"name":"Zodiac.2007.DC.1080p.BluRay.10Bit.HEVC.EAC3-SARTRE","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
