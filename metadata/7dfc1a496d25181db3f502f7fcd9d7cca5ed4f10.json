When Terry Bickers was still in the group, as he was for perhaps half of these non-chronologically ordered recordings, the band crackled well in post-Smiths, pro-glum style. \r\nThe sound of the layered textures Stephen Hague captured on the &quot;butterfly&quot; album (titled, third in a row, as &quot;The House of Love&quot; unhelpfully--the first two are now paired on the Creation anthology) works magically to stimulate the mind and the body. And remains one of my all-time favorites for its fantastic production. \r\nAfter Bickers left to found Levitation, the remaining trio stumbled on with &quot;Babe Rainbow&quot; and &quot;Audience with the Mind&quot; less. The best moments from both are found here, and BR especially has many decent moments excerpted here, but AwtM barely registers, even on the selected cuts collected here.\r\nStill, in lieu of hearing the original &quot;Butterfly&quot; Fontana 1990 release, this helpfully gathers the legacy of in my opinion a very-overlooked band that deserved a better fate.
