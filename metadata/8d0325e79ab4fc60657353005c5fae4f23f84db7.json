We have always embraced the &quot;on the day&quot; approach to recording believing that a certain magic of occasion is captured in the process. We left the pieces long this time, the wonder of compact disc is that it allows for both quality and quantity. Each piece has a rhythmic section driven by sequencers and drum machine, as well as long meditative excursions into the heart of darkness. The title is a phrase grabbed from an undisclosed TV show, which is both a direct reference to the physics involved in the music we make and an apt description of the end result. &apos;Echoes&apos; was named due to the accidental but obvious Pink Floyd reference in this track, and also because everybody has a piece called &apos;Echoes&apos; somewhere in their catalogue. This is ours. - RMI","last_updated":"2017-08-12T12:00:40.318Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d0325e79ab4fc60657353005c5fae4f23f84db7","dn":"Radio Massacre International 2001 Planets In The Wires","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"8d0325e79ab4fc60657353005c5fae4f23f84db7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,3,37,231,154,180,252,96,101,115,83,0,92,95,174,79,35,248,77,183]},"name":"Radio Massacre International 2001 Planets In The Wires","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
