Ft. It Takes Six to Tiny\r\n\r\nDarren and Melody want to show their kids that life is about experiences, not belongings. But when they put their house on the market they never thought their first tiny experience would be temporarily moving their family of six into an old RV. Now Darren and Melody are concerned the idea living tiny might not work for their family, so they&#x2019;ve asked John and Zack to help them create the perfect two trailer tiny house that offers privacy, activity, and a space for their young girls to learn. Their biggest challenge however, will be making sure their 14-year-old son Carter has a space he doesn&#x2019;t mind sharing with his three energetic younger sisters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal Air Date: 06-May-2017","last_updated":"2017-05-25T12:02:14.838Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:cda83b7df51dd8b1999177304c99a58a41253af1","dn":"Tiny.House.Nation.S05E13.688.Sq.Ft.It.Takes.Six.To.Tiny.WEB-DL.x","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"cda83b7df51dd8b1999177304c99a58a41253af1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,168,59,125,245,29,216,177,153,145,119,48,76,153,165,138,65,37,58,241]},"name":"Tiny.House.Nation.S05E13.688.Sq.Ft.It.Takes.Six.To.Tiny.WEB-DL.x","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
