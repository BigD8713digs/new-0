Matthieu Ricard is one of the most compelling voices on the subject, and one of the few who can bring together the teachings of eastern and western thought. In this accessible new work, Ricard provides a straightforward assessment of how to create true and lasting happiness. He addresses the pursuit of a meaningful life at its most fundamental level - the strengthening of the inner conditions that lead to genuine happiness. Ricard helps readers form new patterns of interaction with themselves and with the larger world, working toward happiness step by step, starting with 20 minutes of daily mind training and meditation.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-09-05T12:03:46.357Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d4c08a12308c39b59dbde5a02eea5526cca4115","dn":"Happiness_ A Guide to Developing Life's Most Important Skill by ","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"6d4c08a12308c39b59dbde5a02eea5526cca4115","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,76,8,161,35,8,195,155,89,219,222,90,2,238,165,82,108,202,65,21]},"name":"Happiness_ A Guide to Developing Life's Most Important Skill by ","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
