Welcome to The Blinds, a dusty town in rural Texas populated by misfits who don&apos;t know if they&apos;ve perpetrated a crime or just witnessed one. What&apos;s clear to them is that if they leave, they will end up dead.\r\n\r\nFor eight years Sheriff Calvin Cooper has kept an uneasy peace - but after a suicide and a murder in quick succession, the town&apos;s residents revolt. Cooper has his own secrets to protect, so when his new deputy starts digging, he needs to keep one step ahead of her - and the mysterious outsiders who threaten to tear the whole place down. The more he learns, the more the hard truth is revealed: The Blinds is no sleepy hideaway. It&apos;s simmering with violence and deception, aching heartbreak, and dark betrayals.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-08-03T12:00:33.484Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:2208bbe91f2973b025cbfe94fae7724fba68ed14","dn":"The Blinds by Adam Sternbergh ePUB eBOOK-ZAK","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"2208bbe91f2973b025cbfe94fae7724fba68ed14","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,8,187,233,31,41,115,176,37,203,254,148,250,231,114,79,186,104,237,20]},"name":"The Blinds by Adam Sternbergh ePUB eBOOK-ZAK","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
