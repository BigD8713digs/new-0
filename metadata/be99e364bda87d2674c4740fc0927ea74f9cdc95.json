The dark middle ages, once dominated through nobles and clergy, ends and a new era begins: the age of the free cities of trading and of the free mind!\r\n\r\nIn The Guild 3 you create a family dynasty which can last for centuries. While the world around you and your dynasty rearrange itself again and again - all non-player figures make their own decisions - you have to prove your skills in handicrafts and trading, at social occasion and finally in politics and in malicious intrigues.\r\n\r\nThe Guild 3 is a unique mixture of economic simulation, strategy game, historical life simulation and role playing game in real time 3D, with atmospheric voice recording and medieval soundtrack\r\n\r\nFor more info visit: https://www.gog.com/game/the_guild_3","last_updated":"2017-09-28T12:15:31.980Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:be99e364bda87d2674c4740fc0927ea74f9cdc95","dn":"The Guild 3 (GOG) (In Dev)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"be99e364bda87d2674c4740fc0927ea74f9cdc95","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,153,227,100,189,168,125,38,116,196,116,15,192,146,126,167,79,156,220,149]},"name":"The Guild 3 (GOG) (In Dev)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
