The author is a respected scientist himself and well qualified to speak about the scientific method. His conclusion is that it is simpler and more rational to believe in a creator than in the theory of evolution, although that, of course, involves a willingness to believe in processes other than the gradual ones proposed and believed to have happened by those who have faith in the evolutionary hypothesis.\r\n\r\nPlease seed.
