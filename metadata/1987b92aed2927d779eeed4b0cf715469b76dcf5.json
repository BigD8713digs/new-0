They explore climate change solutions that will make the world healthier and more prosperous, aiming to begin a new type of conversation on the issue that will spur bolder action by cities, businesses, and citizens&#x2014;and even, someday, by Washington.\r\n\r\n&quot;Climate change threatens to reshape the future of our world&apos;s population centers. Bloomberg and Pope have been leaders on fortifying our cities against this threat, and their book proves that victory is possible&#x2014;and imperative.&quot; &#x2014;Leonardo DiCaprio\r\n\r\nThe 2016 election left many people who are concerned about the environment fearful that progress on climate change would come screeching to a halt. But not Michael Bloomberg and Carl Pope.\r\n\r\nBloomberg, an entrepreneur and former mayor of New York City, and Pope, a lifelong environmental leader, approach climate change from different perspectives, yet they arrive at similar conclusions. Without agreeing on every point, they share a belief that cities, businesses, and citizens can lead&#x2014;and win&#x2014;the battle against climate change, no matter which way the political winds in Washington may shift.\r\n\r\nIn Climate of Hope, Bloomberg and Pope offer an optimistic look at the challenge of climate change, the solutions they believe hold the greatest promise, and the practical steps that are necessary to achieve them. Writing from their own experiences, and sharing their own stories from government, business, and advocacy, Bloomberg and Pope provide a road map for tackling the most complicated challenge the world has ever faced. Along the way, they turn the usual way of thinking about climate change on its head: from top down to bottom up, from partisan to pragmatic, from costs to benefits, from tomorrow to today, and from fear to hope.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-08-25T12:01:02.713Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:1987b92aed2927d779eeed4b0cf715469b76dcf5","dn":"Climate of Hope by Michael Bloomberg 2017 RETAiL ePUB eBOOK-DiST","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"1987b92aed2927d779eeed4b0cf715469b76dcf5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,135,185,42,237,41,39,215,121,238,237,75,12,247,21,70,155,118,220,245]},"name":"Climate of Hope by Michael Bloomberg 2017 RETAiL ePUB eBOOK-DiST","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
