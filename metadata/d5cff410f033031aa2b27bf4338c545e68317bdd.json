They&apos;ve got a 200-year-old house, an autistic son obsessed with the Titanic, and 17 chickens, at last count. It&apos;s the kind of paradise where stay-at-home moms team up to cook the school&apos;s hot lunch, dads grill grass-fed burgers, and, as Lucy observes, &quot;chopping kale has become a certain kind of American housewife&apos;s version of chopping wood&quot;.\r\n\r\nWhen friends at a wine-soaked dinner party reveal they&apos;ve made their marriage open, sensible Lucy balks. There&apos;s a part of her, though - the part that worries she&apos;s become too comfortable being invisible - that&apos;s intrigued. Why not try a short marital experiment? Six months, clear ground rules, zero questions asked. When an affair with a man in the city begins to seem more enticing than the happily ever after she&apos;s known for the past nine years, Lucy must decide what truly makes her happy - real life or the experiment?\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-09-23T12:01:43.867Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:d5cff410f033031aa2b27bf4338c545e68317bdd","dn":"The Arrangement_ A Novel by Sarah Dunn ePUB eBOOK-ZAK","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"d5cff410f033031aa2b27bf4338c545e68317bdd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,207,244,16,240,51,3,26,162,178,123,244,51,140,84,94,104,49,123,221]},"name":"The Arrangement_ A Novel by Sarah Dunn ePUB eBOOK-ZAK","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
