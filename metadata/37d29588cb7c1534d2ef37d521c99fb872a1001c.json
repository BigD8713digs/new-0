From his first oyster in the Gironde, to his lowly position as a dishwasher in a honky-tonk fish restaurant in Provincetown, from the kitchen of the Rainbow Room atop Rockefeller Center, to drug dealers in the East Village, from Tokyo to Paris and back to New York again, Bourdain&apos;s tales of the kitchen are as passionate as they are unpredictable.\r\n\r\nKitchen Confidential will make your mouth water while your belly aches with laughter. You&apos;ll beg the chef for more, please.\r\n\r\nAnthony Bourdain is the author of the novels Bone in the Throat and Gone Bamboo. This is his first work of nonfiction. He is the executive chef at Brasserie Les Halles in New York City.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-07-09T12:00:45.629Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:37d29588cb7c1534d2ef37d521c99fb872a1001c","dn":"Kitchen Confidential by Anthony Bourdain PDF eBOOK-ZAK","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"37d29588cb7c1534d2ef37d521c99fb872a1001c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,210,149,136,203,124,21,52,210,239,55,213,33,201,159,184,114,161,0,28]},"name":"Kitchen Confidential by Anthony Bourdain PDF eBOOK-ZAK","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
