Bannon was a bomb-throwing pugilist who&#x2019;d never run a campaign and was despised by Democrats and Republicans alike.\r\n\r\nYet Bannon&#x2019;s hard-edged ethno-nationalism and his elaborate, years-long plot to destroy Hillary Clinton paved the way for Trump&#x2019;s unlikely victory. Trump became the avatar of a dark but powerful worldview that dominated the airwaves and spoke to voters whom others couldn&#x2019;t see. Trump&#x2019;s campaign was the final phase of a populist insurgency that had been building up in America for years, and Bannon, its inscrutable mastermind, believed it was the culmination of a hard-right global uprising that would change the world","last_updated":"2017-08-12T12:00:22.433Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:651c803e0646bec836cd80179294a74d3fa48e24","dn":"Devil's Bargain: Steve Bannon, Donald Trump, and the Storming of","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"651c803e0646bec836cd80179294a74d3fa48e24","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,28,128,62,6,70,190,200,54,205,128,23,146,148,167,77,63,164,142,36]},"name":"Devil's Bargain: Steve Bannon, Donald Trump, and the Storming of","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
