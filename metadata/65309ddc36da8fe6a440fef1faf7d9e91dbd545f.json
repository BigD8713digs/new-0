It was one of the boys&#x2019; birthday, but neither he nor the dozen resurfaced. Worried parents and rescuers flocked to the mouth of a cave that seemed to have swallowed the boys without a trace. Ranging in age from eleven to sixteen, the boys were all members of the Wild Boars soccer team. When water unexpectedly inundated the cave, blocking their escape, they retreated deeper inside, taking shelter in a side cavern. While the world feared them dead, the thirteen young souls survived by licking the condensation off the cave&#x2019;s walls, meditating, and huddling together for warmth.\r\n\r\nGenre: Non-Fiction &gt; Biographies &amp; Memoirs &gt; Survival","last_updated":"2018-11-13T12:27:03.111Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:65309ddc36da8fe6a440fef1faf7d9e91dbd545f","dn":"The Boys in the Cave by Matt Gutman (.epub)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"65309ddc36da8fe6a440fef1faf7d9e91dbd545f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,48,157,220,54,218,143,230,164,64,254,241,250,247,217,233,29,189,84,95]},"name":"The Boys in the Cave by Matt Gutman (.epub)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
