They were the leaders of the world&#x2019;s three most important central banks: Ben Bernanke of the U.S. Federal Reserve, Mervyn King of the Bank of England, and Jean-Claude Trichet of the European Central Bank.\r\n\r\nIn The Alchemists, Washington Post reporter Neil Irwin presents the truly global story of the central bankers&#x2019; role in the world economy that we have been missing. Definitive, revelatory, and riveting, it shows us where money comes from&#x2014;and where it may well be going.\r\n\r\nPaperback: 448 pages\r\nPublisher: Penguin Books; Reprint edition (March 25, 2014)","last_updated":"2018-09-22T12:36:25.125Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:5414ad5b49ed91b26aaf00e669f2f7af4f99ace5","dn":"The Alchemists: Three Central Bankers and a World on Fire","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"5414ad5b49ed91b26aaf00e669f2f7af4f99ace5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,20,173,91,73,237,145,178,106,175,0,230,105,242,247,175,79,153,172,229]},"name":"The Alchemists: Three Central Bankers and a World on Fire","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
