Ordered to rescue an Asgard also marooned in 1947, SG-1 find themselves at the mercy of history. \r\n\r\nWhile Jack, Daniel, Sam and Teal&#x2019;c become embroiled in the Roswell aliens conspiracy, Cam and Vala are stranded in another timeline, desperately searching for a way home. As the effects of their interference ripple through time, the consequences for the future are catastrophic. \r\n\r\nTrapped in the past, SG-1 can only watch as their world is overrun by a terrible invader&#x2026; \r\n\r\nRoswell \r\n&#x201C;You.&#x201D; The lieutenant&#x2019;s nightstick swung around in an arc. He stabbed it in Daniel and Jack&#x2019;s direction as he approached them. \r\n\r\n&#x201C;Who? Us?&#x201D; Jack said, adopting a well-practiced expression of cluelessness that worked so rarely, Daniel wondered why he bothered to try it on anyone. \r\n\r\n&#x201C;Names!&#x201D; \r\n\r\nJack smiled disarmingly. &#x201C;Ah&#x2026;names. Mulder and Scully.&#x201D; \r\n\r\n&#x201C;Where do you live?&#x201D; \r\n\r\n&#x201C;Colorado,&#x201D; Daniel replied, before Jack could get too carried away. &#x201C;We&#x2019;re just passing through town, lieutenant.&#x201D; \r\n\r\n&#x201C;Where ya headed?&#x201D; \r\n\r\n&#x201C;New York,&#x201D; Daniel said without thinking. \r\n\r\n&#x201C;Kinda taking the scenic route, ain&#x2019;t, ya?&#x201D; \r\n\r\n&#x201C;But there&#x2019;s so much to see,&#x201D; Jack said. &#x201C;Little green men, and flying saucers&#x2026; Oh, and arresting innocent citizens eating in a diner.&#x201D; \r\n\r\n&#x201C;Jack!&#x201D; Daniel hissed in warning, but it was too late. The damage was done. \r\n\r\nThe MP&#x2019;s eyes narrowed dangerously. &#x201C;Wise guy, huh?&#x201D; The lieutenant grabbed Jack by the arm. &#x201C;Outside. The both of you. You&#x2019;re coming, too.&#x201D;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOfficial AnonCrypt accounts:  <a href=\"\nhttps://1337x.to/user/AnonCrypt/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://1337x.to/user/AnonCrypt/</a>  <a href=\"\nhttps://thepiratebay.org/user/AnonCrypt/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://thepiratebay.org/user/AnonCrypt/</a> <a href=\"\nhttps://katcr.co/user/AnonCrypt/profile/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://katcr.co/user/AnonCrypt/profile/</a>  <a href=\"\nhttps://www.torrentfunk.com/user/anoncrypt.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://www.torrentfunk.com/user/anoncrypt.html</a> \r\r\n\r\n- Please see our newest torrents for an updated list","last_updated":"2018-07-03T12:05:13.326Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:e1e39b869cd0dc010af57bb17a3f9b05b2381eb0","dn":"Stargate SG-1 - Roswell - SG1-09 - Fandemonium Ltd (2007, Crossr","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"e1e39b869cd0dc010af57bb17a3f9b05b2381eb0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,227,155,134,156,208,220,1,10,245,123,177,122,63,155,5,178,56,30,176]},"name":"Stargate SG-1 - Roswell - SG1-09 - Fandemonium Ltd (2007, Crossr","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
