Niessen (CRC, 2010).pdf\r\n\r\nIn our &quot;throwaway&quot; society, with landfills filled to capacity, interest in incineration- and conversion-based waste management technologies continues to grow. Increasing net waste generation rates within U.S. metropolitan centers, skyrocketing transportation costs for waste hauling, and the enticement of increased electrical revenues from &quot;green&quot; power sources all amplify the need for better technologies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWritten by an internationally renowned expert with fifty years of experience, Combustion and Incineration Processes: Applications in Environmental Engineering, Fourth Edition has been updated to reflect the latest advances in the field, keeping pace with the evolution of complex and interdisciplinary technology that can better the environment. Detailing the changes that have occurred since the previous editions appeared, this volume&#x2019;s expanded scope includes additional details, data, and graphics regarding the design and operational characteristics of municipal and industrial waste incineration and conversion systems and numerous refinements in associated pollution control","last_updated":"2017-06-08T12:03:37.704Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:49a8e9abc0a99465e3d28451b02124a224ffbb42","dn":"Combustion and Incineration Processes 4th ed","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"49a8e9abc0a99465e3d28451b02124a224ffbb42","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,168,233,171,192,169,148,101,227,210,132,81,176,33,36,162,36,255,187,66]},"name":"Combustion and Incineration Processes 4th ed","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
