All the passengers and crew have vanished. When they try to contact the ground they make no connections. They land the plane only to discover that things haven&apos;t changed. But its like the world is dead. No one is there, the air is still, sound doesn&apos;t echo, the food is tasteless. And a distant sound is heard coming closer. A race of monstrous beings bent on their destruction is heading for them, eating everything in sight.\r\n\r\n <a href=\"\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112040/?ref_=nv_sr_1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112040/?ref_=nv_sr_1</a>","last_updated":"2017-11-07T12:12:58.156Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6997ce9df63a0abd7ac8725a3aa0b12cbe617fe","dn":"The Langoliers (1995) MultiSub","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"d6997ce9df63a0abd7ac8725a3aa0b12cbe617fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,153,124,233,223,99,160,171,215,172,135,37,163,170,11,18,203,230,23,254]},"name":"The Langoliers (1995) MultiSub","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
