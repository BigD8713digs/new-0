Lovely gal indeed.\r\n\r\nThe moral of this sad story is that you never put a woman into harms way in the manner in which Grace Kelly is in this affair and with a poor story idea in this regard in any event. There is also shabby scripting at one point in any event when Stewart suggests that Kelly might be getting into a bit of &quot;vicious&quot; banter in what seemed like an innocuous exchange up to that point. You should\r\nhardly ever taint a woman of her kindly and decent virtue with such dialogue in my view in any event.\r\n\r\nThat all said, this is one of Hitchcock&apos;s most popular movies if not the most popular. Great cast (as dear Grace Kelly is featured of course - great memory to have of her seeing her in this movie after all these years), and a suspenseful story including a murder mystery along\r\nthe way!\r\n\r\nenjoy and please seed if you are able to at all\r\nwith thanks!\r\n\r\nMichael Rizzo Chessman\r\n(moviesbyrizzo)","last_updated":"2018-09-08T12:08:08.542Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:9db8d8b90c8de8acf42ec798241570562e0ddcba","dn":"Rear Window (1954) Hitchcock 1080p H.264 Multi (moviesbyrizzo)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"9db8d8b90c8de8acf42ec798241570562e0ddcba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,184,216,185,12,141,232,172,244,46,199,152,36,21,112,86,46,13,220,186]},"name":"Rear Window (1954) Hitchcock 1080p H.264 Multi (moviesbyrizzo)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
