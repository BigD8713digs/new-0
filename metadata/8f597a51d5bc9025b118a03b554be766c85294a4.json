Also you will be able to check the integration of the program in the Windows shell, that is, in the context menu, because from there you can get access to the main features much faster. I wanted to note that Light Image Resizer can work in batch mode, load the required number of images and start editing their parameters. There is an advanced mode, in which there are more options, there you will be able to fine-tune the changes you make. \r\nIf you believe the developers, then their program uses new filters and algorithms in work, so you will get a higher quality result. The program also learned to work with multi-core processors, you can fully customize the compression. Light Image Resizer allows you to set a template for renaming a large number of files, you can import images from memory cards. I liked the interface of the program as I liked it at that time. Nothing has changed, all the settings are clear, the interface is very convenient, you can navigate the tabs simply, in a couple of steps you can perform the necessary actions, you can add pictures simply by transferring them to the main window, in general, I&apos;m happy. On this my small review is considered complete, I hope the tool will be useful to you! \r\n\r\nDeveloper: Obviousidea \r\nLicense: ShareWare \r\nLanguage: Multi + Russian \r\nThe size: 16.46 + 6.85 MB \r\nOS: Windows \r\n\r\nHow to Install: \r\n1).
