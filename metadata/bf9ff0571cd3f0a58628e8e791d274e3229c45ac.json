From 1906, when Italian immigrant Cesare Mondavi passed through Ellis Island, to the Robert Mondavi Corporation&apos;s 21st-century battle over a billion-dollar fortune, award-winning journalist Julia Flynn Siler brings to life both the place and the people in this riveting family drama.\r\n\r\nThe blood feuds are as spectacular as the business triumphs. Cesare&apos;s sons, Robert and Peter, literally came to blows in the 1960s during a dispute touched off by the purchase of a mink coat, resulting in Robert&apos;s exile from the family - and his subsequent founding of a winery that would set off a revolution in American winemaking. Robert&apos;s sons, Michael and Timothy, as passionate in their own ways as their visionary father, waged battles with each other for control of the company before Michael&apos;s expansive ambitions ultimately led to a board coup and the sale of the business to an international conglomerate.\r\n\r\nA meticulously reported narrative based on thousands of hours of interviews, The House of Mondavi is bound to become a classic.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-10-04T12:04:44.607Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf9ff0571cd3f0a58628e8e791d274e3229c45ac","dn":"The House of Mondavi_ The Rise and Fall of an American Wine Dyna","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"bf9ff0571cd3f0a58628e8e791d274e3229c45ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,159,240,87,28,211,240,165,134,40,232,231,145,210,116,227,34,156,69,172]},"name":"The House of Mondavi_ The Rise and Fall of an American Wine Dyna","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
