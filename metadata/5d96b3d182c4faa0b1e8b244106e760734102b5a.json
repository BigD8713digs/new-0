The always funny, frank, and down-to-earth medium began communicating with Spirit at the age of four, but didn&apos;t fully accept her gift until she was 33 years old. She had a good life as a busy wife and mom, but also suffered from chronic anxiety that came from ignoring her unique abilities. Once Theresa began channeling, she discovered that she felt much better after delivering a message from Spirit and releasing that energy. Since then she&apos;s used her extraordinary gift to help countless people heal from the loss of their loved ones.\r\n\r\nTheresa makes us all aware that there is more to life than what we see here in the physical world. She wants you to know that our deceased loved ones are safe and at peace assisting us from The Other Side. She also wants you to realize that the unexplainable things you sense and feel from these souls are real, and that it&apos;s healthy and essential to acknowledge them.\r\n\r\nThere&apos;s More to Life than This explains how Theresa&apos;s mediumship works, what happens to our soul when we die, what Heaven is like, what the deceased want us to know, the importance of living a positive life, and the many roles that our family, friends, angels, guides, and God play here and in the afterlife. It also explores how to safely connect with Spirit, so that we can recognize when our loved ones are reaching out.\r\n\r\nCombining Theresa&apos;s personal story, compelling anecdotes, and client readings, this remarkable book teaches us about Spirit and helps us understand the life-affirming messages that are sent to us every day.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-08-13T12:00:20.483Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d96b3d182c4faa0b1e8b244106e760734102b5a","dn":"There's More to Life Than This_ Healing Messages, Remarkable Sto","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"5d96b3d182c4faa0b1e8b244106e760734102b5a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,150,179,209,130,196,250,160,177,232,178,68,16,110,118,7,52,16,43,90]},"name":"There's More to Life Than This_ Healing Messages, Remarkable Sto","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
