I am happy to say yes. Today it is a matter of one Zack Clarke,\r\npianist, electronician, leader of a very capable trio on the album Random Acts\r\nof Order (Clean Feed 409).\r\n\r\nThis is a free trio with a decided difference. Henry Fraser is the double\r\nbassist, Dre Hocevar the drummer, and they both contribute much to the\r\noutcome. But it is Clarke&apos;s pianism that especially wins me over. He has a well\r\ndeveloped harmonic sense and a great touch, yet he fits in not much at all with\r\nthe Paul Bley vs Keith Jarrett-Bill Evans vs Cecil Taylor schools. Actually if\r\nI think about it he may have some affinity with early Burton Greene, but not in\r\nany obvious way. And there is a jagged quality that may channel Bley but only\r\nin the most whispie sense.\r\n\r\nHe covers spooky ambiance and topsy-turvey free rolling post-swing. And he does\r\nit in his very own way. It is an album that hangs together very well.\r\n\r\nZack and trio bring to us another way to slice the avant pie. It is a pleasure\r\nto hear and experience this. Something new!\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nBy Rick Joines <a href=\"\nhttp://www.freejazzblog.org/2017/07/zack-clarke-random-acts-of-order-clean.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttp://www.freejazzblog.org/2017/07/zack-clarke-random-acts-of-order-clean.html</a>\r\n\r\nBy John Sharpe <a href=\"\nhttps://www.allaboutjazz.com/random-acts-of-order-zack-clarke-clean-feed-records-review-by-john-sharpe.php\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://www.allaboutjazz.com/random-acts-of-order-zack-clarke-clean-feed-records-review-by-john-sharpe.php</a>\r\n\r\nBy Filipe Freitas <a href=\"\nhttps://jazztrail.net/blog/2017/8/22/zack-clarke-random-acts-order-album-review\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://jazztrail.net/blog/2017/8/22/zack-clarke-random-acts-order-album-review</a>\r\n\r\nDa Ettore Garzia (it)","last_updated":"2018-12-07T12:07:39.672Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:5520e42934c08d369e772b63fff14e33462d2439","dn":"Zack Clarke - Random Acts of Order (2017)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"5520e42934c08d369e772b63fff14e33462d2439","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,32,228,41,52,192,141,54,158,119,43,99,255,241,78,51,70,45,36,57]},"name":"Zack Clarke - Random Acts of Order (2017)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
