Warm, engaging and often amusing collection of writing which offers thoughts on a wide variety of topics, including the origin and composition of Philip&apos;s own stories, the craft of writing and the storytellers who have meant the most to Philip. The art of storytelling is everywhere present in the essays themselves, in the instantly engaging tone, the vivid imagery and striking phrases, the resonant anecdotes, the humour and learnedness. Together, they are greater than the sum of their parts: a single sustained engagement with story and storytelling.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-09-30T12:41:24.413Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:621b4f1b494490cc9a0f4d1ee3ce44f29ad26aae","dn":"Daemon Voices: Essays on Storytelling by Philip Pullman EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"621b4f1b494490cc9a0f4d1ee3ce44f29ad26aae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,27,79,27,73,68,144,204,154,15,77,30,227,206,68,242,154,210,106,174]},"name":"Daemon Voices: Essays on Storytelling by Philip Pullman EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
