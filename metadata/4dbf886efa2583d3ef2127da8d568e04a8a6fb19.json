Proud of the fact that his family is comprised of three generations who all performed at Carnegie Hall, he can truly say music is in their &#x2018;blood.&#x2019; Ian sang lead for the band Stories, formed with Michael Brown in the early 70&#x2019;s. Their first hit was &#x201C;I&#x2019;m Coming Home&#x201D; followed by their #1 smash hit &#x201C;Brother Louie&#x201D; and then &#x201C;Mammy Blue.&#x201D; With Stories, Ian performed on a number of TV shows including &#x201C;American Bandstand&#x201D; and the &#x201C;Midnight Special.&#x201D; &#x201C;Brother Louie&#x201D; can also be heard on a number of feature film soundtracks.\r\nWhen Stories disbanded, Ian pursued a solo career. His well-received albums include Goosebumps, (which produced a Top 40 hit &#x201C;Slip Away&#x201D; written by Ric Ocasek of The Cars), Third Wave Civilization, Planet X, and his current CD In The Land Of O-de-PO, which won the 2009 GMMA awards for &#x201C;Best Rock Track,&#x201D; and also includes a cover version of &#x201C;Brother Louie.&#x201D;\r\nWith a litany of credits to his name, Ian&#x2019;s career and his indomitable vocal style have firmly established his place in rock history. His distinctive voice has won him international acclaim and fans that adore him. Ian continues his tradition of powerful vocals and electric performances with Ian Lloyd&#x2019;s Stories and his intimate association with the modern rock band Social Hero, keeping him busy on the road and in the studio. With a few secret projects up his sleeve Ian guarantees that there will be more to come! - live4ever.uk.com","last_updated":"2017-07-29T12:02:54.200Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:4dbf886efa2583d3ef2127da8d568e04a8a6fb19","dn":"Ian Lloyd 1997 Planet X","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"4dbf886efa2583d3ef2127da8d568e04a8a6fb19","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,191,136,110,250,37,131,211,239,33,39,218,141,86,142,4,168,166,251,25]},"name":"Ian Lloyd 1997 Planet X","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
