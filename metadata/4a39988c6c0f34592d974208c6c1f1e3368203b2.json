Alcoholic beverages made by brewing cereals, such as beer and Japanese sake, are extremely popular. Brewing them requires a complicated process by which the cereal must be saccharified using enzymes such as amylase. For example, with beer brewing, malt enzymes are used for saccharification. By germination, malt is made from barley to produce enzymes. Finally, wort is made by processing at higher temperatures using malt. The actual techniques require high-level skills.\r\n\r\nContents:\r\n\r\n1 Narrow Leaf Mutants in the Grass Family \r\n2 Oxidative Enzyme Effects in Malt for Brewing \r\n3 Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.)
