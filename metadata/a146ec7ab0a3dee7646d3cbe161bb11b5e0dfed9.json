We&apos;ve spent multiple years building a custom in-house engine capable highly detailed ship interior simulations while still supporting real time combat between large numbers of ships in an open persistent world.\r\n\r\nThe result is a massive open world where any ship, station, asteroid, artifact, or wreckage can be entered by the player and controlled in real-time. Space battles are epic and immersive because there are no hit points, instead you have to try and survive as pieces of your ship are physically destroyed and ships can be cut in half or filled full of holes. Play as a renegade shooting up neutral supply convoys and scooping the cargo that falls out, or disable and board enemy ships to take back to your hideout. Research technology and upgrade designs to make your favorite ship into the ultimate war machine. The universe is full of loot and enemies and things to explore, and your character will have all the tools needed to design the ultimate ship and put together the ultimate crew","last_updated":"2017-07-22T12:01:03.548Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:a146ec7ab0a3dee7646d3cbe161bb11b5e0dfed9","dn":"Wayward Terran Frontier: Zero Falls v6.2.00","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"a146ec7ab0a3dee7646d3cbe161bb11b5e0dfed9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,70,236,122,176,163,222,231,100,109,60,190,22,27,177,27,94,13,254,217]},"name":"Wayward Terran Frontier: Zero Falls v6.2.00","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
