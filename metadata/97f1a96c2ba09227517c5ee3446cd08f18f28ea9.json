Her spontaneous, explosive approach to political action has involved jumping over barbed wire, kissing police officers, giving guerilla performances in crowded subway cars, and going on a hunger strike to protest the abuse of prisoners. She&#x2019;s been horse-whipped by police in Sochi, temporarily blinded when officers threw green paint in her eyes, and monitored by the Russian government. But what made Nadya an activist icon overnight happened on February 21, 2012, when she was arrested for performing an anti-Putin protest song in a Moscow church. \r\n\r\nShe was sent to a Russian prison for 18 months and emerged as an international symbol of radical resistance, as calls to &#x201C;Free Pussy Riot&#x201D; resounded around the world. With her emblematic ski mask, black lipstick, and unwavering bravery, Nadya has become an emissary of hope and optimism despite overwhelming and ugly political corruption.\r\n\r\nGenre: Non-Fiction &gt; General","last_updated":"2018-10-11T12:18:10.318Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:97f1a96c2ba09227517c5ee3446cd08f18f28ea9","dn":"Read &amp; Riot by Nadya Tolokonnikova (.epub)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"97f1a96c2ba09227517c5ee3446cd08f18f28ea9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,241,169,108,43,160,146,39,81,124,94,227,68,108,208,143,24,242,142,169]},"name":"Read &amp; Riot by Nadya Tolokonnikova (.epub)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
