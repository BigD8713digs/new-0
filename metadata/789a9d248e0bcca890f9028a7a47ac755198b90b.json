It may be the wrong question. Most of us think we are relatively happy, while at the same time knowing that we could be happier - maybe even a lot happier. Ordinary people and the finest philosophers have been exploring the question of happiness for thousands of years, and theories abound. But this is not a book of theory. Resisting Happiness is a deeply personal, disarmingly transparent look at why we sabotage our own happiness and what to do about it.\r\n\r\nAre you overwhelmed? Do you procrastinate? Do you sometimes feel like you are your own worst enemy? Are you ignoring your dreams? Have you lost the courage to truly be yourself? Do you feel that your life lacks meaning and purpose? Do you find yourself avoiding the real issues in your life and focusing on the superficial?\r\n\r\nWe all experience these feelings and doubts from time to time. But do you know what to do when you experience them? In this fascinating book, Matthew Kelly uses his signature combination of the profound and the practical to help us understand why we feel these things and how to rise above them.\r\n\r\nBreaking through resistance, Kelly tells us, is essential to becoming the best version of ourselves and living with passion and purpose.\r\n\r\nWhat is resistance? It&apos;s that sluggish feeling of not wanting to do something that you know is good for you. It&apos;s the inclination to do something that you unabashedly know is not good for you. It&apos;s the desire and tendency to delay something you should be doing right now.\r\n\r\nIt is resistance that stands between you and happiness. In this book you will learn not only what it is, but how to recognize and conquer it in your own life.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-11-12T12:01:00.966Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:789a9d248e0bcca890f9028a7a47ac755198b90b","dn":"Resisting Happiness by Matthew Kelly EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"789a9d248e0bcca890f9028a7a47ac755198b90b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,154,157,36,142,11,204,168,144,249,2,138,122,71,172,117,81,152,185,11]},"name":"Resisting Happiness by Matthew Kelly EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
