Poking fun at atheists in a clever and intelligent way, Anthony DeStefano demonstrates just how full of holes the new atheism is and reveals that it is actually a &quot;religion&quot; of its own, complete with a creed, a set of commandments, a rigid moral code, and rewards and punishments. More than that, DeStefano exposes that atheism is itself a &quot;superstition&quot; of the worst kind.\r\n\r\nUsing irony and a healthy dose of playful sarcasm, Inside the Atheist Mind lampoons, teases, and deflates the atheist position, unmasking it for what it is - an empty, intellectually barren philosophy, devoid of any logic and common sense. \r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-03-22T15:00:33.108Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:e58cc8ce0c1b6cb56daf14ad501efe1af3898ba8","dn":"Inside the Atheist Mind by Anthony DeStefano EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"e58cc8ce0c1b6cb56daf14ad501efe1af3898ba8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,140,200,206,12,27,108,181,109,175,20,173,80,30,254,26,243,137,139,168]},"name":"Inside the Atheist Mind by Anthony DeStefano EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
