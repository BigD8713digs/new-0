The police said it was a robbery but nothing was stolen - his watch, phone and wallet were found with him. The murder took place during one of the ugliest and most vicious presidential campaigns in American history. Within weeks of his death, stories emerged that Rich was behind the Wikileaks leak of thousands of damaging internal emails detailing the inner workings of the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton&apos;s campaign - and that his murder was no random robbery.\r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC High L3.1\r\n * Video Bitrate: CRF 19 (~1930Kbps)\r\n * Video Resolution: 1280x720\r\n * Frame Rate: 25 FPS\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC-LC\r\n * Audio Bitrate: Q=0.46 VBR 48KHz (~127Kbps)\r\n * Audio Channels: 2\r\n * Run-Time: 59 mins\r\n * Part Size: 869 MB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Subtitles: Merged","last_updated":"2018-04-07T13:03:34.712Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f5e4d939ba3c3e93b0a2985790bbbca20dd93df","dn":"BBC Conspiracy Files Murder in Washington 720p x264 AAC HDTV MVG","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"6f5e4d939ba3c3e93b0a2985790bbbca20dd93df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,94,77,147,155,163,195,233,59,10,41,133,121,11,187,202,32,221,147,223]},"name":"BBC Conspiracy Files Murder in Washington 720p x264 AAC HDTV MVG","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
