The show starred Don Johnson and Cheech Marin as two detectives with the San Francisco Police Department. Nash Bridges (Johnson) is Captain of the Special Investigations Unit, a man-about-town, who drives around in a distinctive yellow 1971 Plymouth Barracuda. He has two ex-wives, many girlfriends and a young daughter to keep him busy. Joe Dominguez (Marin), Nash&apos;s partner and best friend is a affable Mexican-American, firmly under the thumb of his Swedish wife Inger, and always on the look out for ways to make money on the side. In fact the two set up their own Private Detective agency, while still working for SFPD. \r\n\r\n\r\nEncoded directly from the DVD set using Handbrake using a variable bitrate with x265 video and 96kbps AAC audio.  Matches records on theTVDB for immediate add of the series to PLEX and KODI","last_updated":"2017-06-03T12:05:32.310Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:faa9cf2fe76318f116d946de037da7469d91300a","dn":"Nash Bridges DVDRip HEVC x265","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"faa9cf2fe76318f116d946de037da7469d91300a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,169,207,47,231,99,24,241,22,217,70,222,3,125,167,70,157,145,48,10]},"name":"Nash Bridges DVDRip HEVC x265","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
