But Eliza swears she was pushed, and her rescuer is the only witness.\r\n\r\nDesperate to find out who attacked her, Eliza takes it upon herself to investigate. But as the publication date for her novel draws closer, Eliza finds more questions than answers. Like why are her editor, agent, and family mixing up events from her novel with events from her life? Her novel is completely fictional, isn&#x2019;t it?\r\n\r\nThe deeper Eliza goes into her investigation while struggling with memory loss, the closer her life starts to resemble her novel, until the line between reality and fiction starts to blur and she can no longer tell where her protagonist&#x2019;s life ends and hers begins.\r\n\r\nFans of Pretty Little Liars, S. J. Watson&#x2019;s Before I Go to Sleep, and Ruth Ware&#x2019;s The Woman in Cabin 10 will be drawn to the drama of feeling like no one is on your side, the high tension of not knowing who you can trust, the hair-raising truths hidden among lies, and a faceless, nameless presence controlling Eliza&#x2019;s life from the shadows.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-04-23T12:00:40.756Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:76639d3885007e453260c73746067218d4f41710","dn":"The Elizas: A Novel by Sara Shepard EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"76639d3885007e453260c73746067218d4f41710","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,99,157,56,133,0,126,69,50,96,199,55,70,6,114,24,212,244,23,16]},"name":"The Elizas: A Novel by Sara Shepard EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
