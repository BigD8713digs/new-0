Or Susan B. Anthony when she was arrested for voting in 1872. Or Alice Paul when she was imprisoned and tortured for peacefully protesting outside of the White House in 1917.\r\n\r\nThe story of women&apos;s suffrage is epic. For over 70 years, heroic women risked their lives for the cause knowing they likely wouldn&apos;t live to cast a vote. At a time when sexism was inherent in daily life, these women (and a few men) created a movement and fought for it passionately until the vote on the 19th amendment was finally called in 1920. It passed by a single vote. This under-explored history resonates now more than ever, and will remind readers that ordinary citizens and peaceful protest can affect lasting change in this country.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-01-18T19:01:15.329Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6124ea74777e87260507bd65dd3d2319300c3fc","dn":"Roses and Radicals by Susan Zimet EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"e6124ea74777e87260507bd65dd3d2319300c3fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,18,78,167,71,119,232,114,96,80,123,214,93,211,210,49,147,0,195,252]},"name":"Roses and Radicals by Susan Zimet EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
