About engineered mycoplasma pathogens in vaccines? Or will he or she treat your symptoms, hook you up for life (or death) on high-priced (and often dangerous) drugs?\r\n\r\nWhat&apos;s the real story of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Gulf War Syndrome, AIDS and other degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer&apos;s, Crohns, Parkinson&apos;s, Huntington&apos;s, Lupus, Lyme disease, fibromyalgia, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, diabetes (type one) and MANY others? If your doctor doesn&apos;t know about (or isn&apos;t CURIOUS about) US chemical &amp; biological warfare, Operation Paperclip, MKNAOMI, MKDELTA, Texas prison inmates being used as guinea pigs to test genetically engineered pathogens (mycoplasma fermentans incognitus), then get another doctor. You can&apos;t afford not to know what Dr. Nicolson is carefully, cautiously, telling us.\r\n\r\nPlease share this information far and wide, burn the video to DVDs/Blu-ray discs or put it on USB Flash Drives and give them out to friends, family and others.\r\n\r\nPlease seed as long as possible, at least to a ratio of 1.100, thank you :)\r\n\r\nGeneral           : Chronic Diseases - Who&apos;s killing us, and how.mp4\r\nFormat            : MPEG-4 at 358 kb/s\r\nLength            : 26.8 MiB for 10 min 29 s 196 ms\r\n\r\nVideo #0          : AVC at 228 kb/s\r\nAspect            : 320 x 240 (1.333) at 14.985 fps\r\n\r\nAudio #0          : AAC at 126 kb/s\r\nInfos             : 2 channels, 44.1 kHz\r\n\r\nScreens: <a href=\"\nhttps://extraimage.net/images/2018/11/22/d4be899b3e8e63ae65b6905fe19c32d8.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://extraimage.net/images/2018/11/22/d4be899b3e8e63ae65b6905fe19c32d8.png</a> <a href=\"\nhttps://extraimage.net/images/2018/11/22/2db68de97cf631580d4bc40b29e254f4.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://extraimage.net/images/2018/11/22/2db68de97cf631580d4bc40b29e254f4.png</a> <a href=\"\nhttps://extraimage.net/images/2018/11/22/a21b7f1783cd7955b9b05a57168d00e1.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://extraimage.net/images/2018/11/22/a21b7f1783cd7955b9b05a57168d00e1.png</a> <a href=\"\nhttps://extraimage.net/images/2018/11/22/aef7eb001cb87f8c281c02e9f6a485c5.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://extraimage.net/images/2018/11/22/aef7eb001cb87f8c281c02e9f6a485c5.png</a> <a href=\"\nhttps://extraimage.net/images/2018/11/22/1f18094a8f7dffc5b78c6ea44187cfa5.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://extraimage.net/images/2018/11/22/1f18094a8f7dffc5b78c6ea44187cfa5.png</a> <a href=\"\nhttps://extraimage.net/images/2018/11/22/127493880161d64c3c1a04a9150aff02.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://extraimage.net/images/2018/11/22/127493880161d64c3c1a04a9150aff02.png</a>","last_updated":"2018-11-22T12:16:19.331Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:7367c6d0bc10834f5dc1373106ac8d5e85348b90","dn":"Chronic Diseases: Who's killing us, and how?","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"7367c6d0bc10834f5dc1373106ac8d5e85348b90","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,103,198,208,188,16,131,79,93,193,55,49,6,172,141,94,133,52,139,144]},"name":"Chronic Diseases: Who's killing us, and how?","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
