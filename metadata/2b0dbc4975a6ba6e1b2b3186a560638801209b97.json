His work explored religion, politics, isolation, sexuality and personal relationships.  In his eloquent search for what he called a &quot;state of grace&quot; -- the kind of balance with which one rises to the chaos around him -- Cohen eluded the restrictions of genres and generations.  Eclectic, searching, his voice was above all deeply personal.\n\nBefore he launched a music career in 1967, at age 33, Cohen pursued one as a poet and novelist during the 1950s and early 1960s.  His first book of poetry, LET US COMPARE MYTHOLOGIES (1956), clearly shows the obsessions (love, power, religion, poetry) that marked his entire career as an artist.  Published soon after the release of his first album, SELECTED POEMS (1968) presented a generous selection of material, including many of the ecstatically lyric poems first published in earlier collections and a number of new poems, many with strong social and religious overtones.  BOOK OF MERCY (1984) contained 50 prose-poems influenced by the Hebrew Bible and Zen writings.  His more recent volumes of poetry were STRANGER MUSIC (1993) and BOOK OF LONGING (1996), the latter containing 167 previously unpublished poems and drawings, mostly written at a Zen monastery on Mount Baldy in California and in India.\n\nCohen published two novels, THE FAVOURITE GAME (1963), an autobiographical bildungsroman about a young man who discovers his identity through writing, and BEAUTIFUL LOSERS (1966), which is filled with the mysticism, radicalism, sexuality, and drug-taking emblematic of the era, and is noted for its linguistic, technical, and sexual excesses.  Both are now firmly established in the Canadian literary canon.\n\nThis torrent also includes THE FLAME (2018), the final work from Cohen, featuring poems, excerpts from his private notebooks, lyrics, and hand-drawn self-portraits.  &#x201C;This volume contains my father&#x2019;s final efforts as a poet,&#x201D; writes Cohen&#x2019;s son, Adam Cohen, in his foreword. &#x201C;It was what he was staying alive to do, his sole breathing purpose at the end.&#x201D;\n\n&quot;Each page of paper that he blackened,&quot; in the words of his son, &quot;was lasting evidence of a burning soul.&quot;\n\n\nThe following books are in ePUB format unless otherwise noted:\n\n\n                             == POETRY &amp; LYRICS ==\n\n* Book of Longing (Penguin, 2006)\n* Book of Mercy (McClelland &amp; Stewart, 2010)\n* Fifteen Poems (Vintage, 2014)\n* Flame, The (FSG, 2018).
