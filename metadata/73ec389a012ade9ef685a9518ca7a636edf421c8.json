Amid the minefields of Nagorno-Karabkh, Simon is pelted with snowballs by refugee children.\r\n\r\n\r\nFile Name : BBC.Places.That.Don&apos;t.Exist.With.Simon.Reeve.S01E01.Somaliland.mp4\r\nFile Size : 182.42 MB\r\nResolution : 854x480\r\nDuration : 00:29:04\r\nVideo : AVC (AVC), 745 Kbps, 25.000 fps\r\nAudio : AAC (AAC LC), 126 Kbps (CBR), 44.1 KHz, 2 channels, 1 stream\r\nSubtitles: English\r\n <a href=\"\nhttps://extraimage.net/images/2017/07/16/19b8cf2720e6d5239363e93b0ffe5a14.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://extraimage.net/images/2017/07/16/19b8cf2720e6d5239363e93b0ffe5a14.jpg</a> <a href=\"\nhttps://extraimage.net/images/2017/07/16/5e716c748acf27ed9492480006ebf75f.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://extraimage.net/images/2017/07/16/5e716c748acf27ed9492480006ebf75f.jpg</a>","last_updated":"2017-07-16T12:04:18.398Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:73ec389a012ade9ef685a9518ca7a636edf421c8","dn":"BBC.Places.That.Don't.Exist.With.Simon.Reeve.S01.PACK.2005","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"73ec389a012ade9ef685a9518ca7a636edf421c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,236,56,154,1,42,222,158,246,133,169,81,140,167,166,54,237,244,33,200]},"name":"BBC.Places.That.Don't.Exist.With.Simon.Reeve.S01.PACK.2005","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
