First published in 1899, his haunting novel Lord Jim is both a riveting sea adventure and a fascinating portrait of a unique outcast from civilization. One long evening, over cigars and brandy, the seasoned sea captain, Marlow, recalls the life of a handsome young first mate who loses his ship and his honor, but becomes a god. As his friends listen and question, the powerful and eloquent story of Lord Jim unfolds. Joseph Conrad&#x2019;s novels are timeless. The images he creates in Lord Jim, of man&#x2019;s struggle to maintain a balance between morality and human weakness, have been echoed in countless other novels and major motion pictures. Narrator Steven Crossley provides the perfect voice to convey both the worldly-wise Marlow and the brilliant but deeply flawed Jim","last_updated":"2017-06-26T12:01:47.879Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:af4e2b590cd5a9b20075c30e29821f16a2ec51a5","dn":"Lord Jim by Joseph Conrad epub RtR","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"af4e2b590cd5a9b20075c30e29821f16a2ec51a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,78,43,89,12,213,169,178,0,117,195,14,41,130,31,22,162,236,81,165]},"name":"Lord Jim by Joseph Conrad epub RtR","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
