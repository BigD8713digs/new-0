Then Jack gets a break that could turn the case. Jamal&#x2019;s murder bears disturbing similarities to another lynching that occurred back in the Jim Crow days of 1944. Are the chilling parallels purely coincidental?\r\n\r\n\r\nRead by: Jonathan Davis\r\n\r\nLength: 12:06:39\r\n\r\nFormat: Stereo mp3\r\n\r\nBit Rate: 128Kbps/44.1Hz\r\n\r\nRemember to tip your uploader and seed! :)","last_updated":"2018-06-17T12:06:30.077Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b1037350722450f651b23944d5feb635e92fa6e","dn":"A Death in Live Oak - James Grippando","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"0b1037350722450f651b23944d5feb635e92fa6e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,16,55,53,7,34,69,15,101,27,35,148,77,95,235,99,94,146,250,110]},"name":"A Death in Live Oak - James Grippando","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
