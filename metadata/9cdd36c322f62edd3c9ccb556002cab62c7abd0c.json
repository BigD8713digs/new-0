Use no other words. The Tao is constantly moving, the path that all life and the whole universe takes. There is nothing that is not part of it - harmonious living is to know and to move with the Tao - it is a way of life, the natural order of things, a force that flows through all life.\r\n\r\n365 Tao is a contemporary book of meditations on what it means to be wholly a part of the Taoist way, and thus to be completely in harmony with oneself and the surrounding world. Deng Ming-Dao is the author of eight books, including The Living I Ching, Chronicles of Tao, Everyday Tao, and Scholar Warrior. His books have been translated into fifteen languages.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-06-03T12:13:29.987Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:9cdd36c322f62edd3c9ccb556002cab62c7abd0c","dn":"365 Tao: Daily Meditations by Ming-Dao Deng EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"9cdd36c322f62edd3c9ccb556002cab62c7abd0c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,221,54,195,34,246,46,221,60,156,203,85,96,2,202,182,44,122,189,12]},"name":"365 Tao: Daily Meditations by Ming-Dao Deng EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
