Virtual applications can be delivered as standalone executables, MSIs or Turbo images.\r\n\r\nSnapshot an application or component: snapshots capture the system state before and after an application is installed. Based on the observed system changes, the virtual application settings are automatically configured. This method is ideal for virtualizing off-the-shelf applications or ones that use complex MSI installer packages that would be incompatible with the command-line interface.\r\n\r\nTurboStudio runs on any Windows operating system, including systems running within VMware and Microsoft hardware virtualization and hypervisor environments. TurboStudio has limited support for the Windows Preinstallation Environment (WinPE), though certain applications (depending on operating system features unavailable in WinPE) may not function properly.\r\n\r\nTurboStudio supports both 32- and 64-bit applications. Both 32-bit (under 32-bit mode) and 64-bit executables can be run on x64-based platforms.\r\n\r\nKey Features\r\n\r\nRun .NET Without .NET\r\nEmbed runtime dependencies such as .NET, Java, AIR, and SQL CE directly into virtual applications. Launch on completely clean desktops.\r\n\r\nMigrate to Windows 10\r\nTurbo.net allows legacy applications such as Internet Explorer 6 to execute on Windows 7, 8, and 10 unblocking operating system rollouts and assuring business continuity.\r\n\r\nDeploy Anywhere\r\nDeploy in standalone EXEs or traditional MSIs.\r\n\r\n#1 in Compatibility\r\nVirtualize both 32-bit and 64-bit applications, databases such as SQL Server, services such as IIS, as well as DCOM and SxS.\r\n\r\nEasy to Use\r\nUse setup capture to virtualize custom applications.\r\n\r\nEliminate Conflicts\r\nApplications run in isolated sandboxes, eliminating conflicts, administrator privilege requirements, and other sources of application failure. Launch multiple application versions side-by-side","last_updated":"2018-05-31T12:05:11.306Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:e2af875636164b5ac7229f1412552b4f992f022b","dn":"Turbo Studio 18.4.1080.15 for Windows","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"e2af875636164b5ac7229f1412552b4f992f022b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,175,135,86,54,22,75,90,199,34,159,20,18,85,43,79,153,47,2,43]},"name":"Turbo Studio 18.4.1080.15 for Windows","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
