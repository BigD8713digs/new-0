P. DONLEAVY (1926-2017) was an American-born Irish novelist and playwright whose works are noted for their coarse sense of humour and for characters who remain deeply attached to life despite its flaws.\n\nHis best-known novel is THE GINGER MAN (1955), which was banned both in Ireland and the United States for obscenity.  It is a dense book, with a stream-of-consciousness narrative that dips in and out of the first and third persons, chronicling the adventures, in love and liquor, of a likable rake, Sebastian Dangerfield.  It has sold 45 million copies worldwide and has never been out of print.  Later novels continued to develop the same alliterative prose style.  The trilogy about the misadventures of an Irish vagabond began with THE DESTINIES OF DARCY DANCER, GENTLEMAN (1977) and continued with LEILA (1983).  The story of SCHULTZ (1979) continued in ARE YOU LISTENING, RABBI L&#xD6;W (1987), which chronicles Schultz&#x2019;s incessant trials with women and money and was widely criticized for its vulgarity and use of derogatory Jewish and female stereotypes.  THE LADY WHO LIKED CLEAN RESTROOMS (1997) is a satirical tale of a depressed, formerly wealthy middle-aged woman obsessed with propriety.  WRONG INFORMATION IS BEING GIVEN OUT AT PRINCETON (1998) is the story of a feckless aspiring composer.\n\nDonleavy&apos;s other works include A SINGULAR COUNTRY (1989), a humorous and biting critique of modern Ireland, and THE HISTORY OF THE GINGER MAN (1994), which chronicles, with characteristic exaggeration, the challenges of writing and publishing his most famous novel.\n\n\nThe following books are in ePUB format unless otherwise noted:\n\n\n                              == FICTION ==\n\n* Are You Listening, Rabbi Lo&#x308;w (Atlantic Monthly, 1988) -- ePUB + PDF\n* Beastly Beatitudes of Balthazar B, The (Grove, 2007)\n* De Alfonce Tennis (Dutton, 1984) -- PDF\n* Destinies of Darcy Dancer, Gentleman (Grove, 2007)\n* Fairy Tale of New York, A (Atlantic Monthly, 2007)\n* Ginger Man, The (Grove, 2010)\n* Lady Who Liked Clean Restrooms, The (Lilliput, 2012)\n* Leila (Grove, 2007)\n* Meet My Maker the Mad Molecule (Lilliput, 2011)\n* Onion Eaters, The (Lilliput, 2012)\n* Saddest Summer of Samuel S, The (Lilliput, 2011)\n* Schultz (Lilliput, 2013)\n* Singular Man, A (Atlantic Monthly, 2007)\n* Wrong Information is Being Given Out at Princeton (Lilliput, 2012)\n\n\n                               == PLAYS ==\n\n* Plays of J.
