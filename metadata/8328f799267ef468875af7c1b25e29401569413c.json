In 2008, when she was 15 years old, she landed the role of Charlotte in the Broadway production of 13; her performance was well-received, winning a National Youth Theatre Association Award. Following an appearance in the 2010 Desmond Child-written musical Cuba Libre, Grande was cast as Cat Valentine in the Nickelodeon television program Victorious. The show ran until 2012, at which time Grande&apos;s Cat Valentine was spun off into a show called Sam &amp; Cat, which also starred Jennette McCurdy of iCarly.\r\n\r\nAs she kept herself busy with television, Grande began to pursue a musical career. She frequently made appearances at sporting events and with symphonies, and she made her first appearances on record via the soundtracks to Victorious. In 2011, she released the single &quot;Put Your Hearts Up,&quot; which was cut during sessions for a teen-oriented pop album; she later disowned the single due to its kiddie feel. Grande felt much more comfortable with &quot;The Way,&quot; her 2013 single featuring Mac Miller. This signaled a mature direction and audiences responded, taking it to the Top Ten in the U.S., where it was eventually certified triple platinum. It was the first single from her 2013 debut, Yours Truly, which also featured hits in &quot;Baby I&quot; and &quot;Right There.&quot;","last_updated":"2018-08-26T12:10:53.797Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:8328f799267ef468875af7c1b25e29401569413c","dn":"Ariana Grande - Collection (2012-2018) MP3 (320kbps) [DR]","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"8328f799267ef468875af7c1b25e29401569413c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,40,247,153,38,126,244,104,135,90,247,193,178,94,41,64,21,105,65,60]},"name":"Ariana Grande - Collection (2012-2018) MP3 (320kbps) [DR]","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
