She cold-shouldered Princess Diana and humiliated Elizabeth Taylor.\r\n\r\nAndy Warhol photographed her. Jack Nicholson offered her cocaine. Gore Vidal revered her. John Fowles hoped to keep her as his sex slave. Dudley Moore propositioned her. Francis Bacon heckled her. Peter Sellers was in love with her.\r\n\r\nFor Pablo Picasso, she was the object of sexual fantasy. &apos;If they knew what I had done in my dreams with your royal ladies,&apos; he confided to a friend, &apos;they would take me to the Tower of London and chop off my head!&apos;\r\n\r\nPrincess Margaret aroused passion and indignation in equal measures. To her friends she was witty and regal. To her enemies she was rude and demanding.\r\n\r\nIn her 1950s heyday, she was seen as one of the most glamorous and desirable women in the world. By the time of her death, she had come to personify disappointment. One friend said he had never known an unhappier woman.\r\n\r\nThe tale of Princess Margaret is pantomime as tragedy and tragedy as pantomime. It is Cinderella in reverse: hope dashed, happiness mislaid, life mishandled.\r\n\r\nCombining interviews, parodies, dreams, parallel lives, diaries, announcements, lists, catalogues and essays, Ma&apos;am Darling is a kaleidoscopic experiment in biography and a witty meditation on fame and art, snobbery and deference, bohemia and high society.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-09-27T12:00:43.663Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc7f339cb86c103bceaec0120fc5db071998634a","dn":"Ma'am Darling_ 99 Glimpses of Princess Margaret by Craig Brown e","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"cc7f339cb86c103bceaec0120fc5db071998634a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,127,51,156,184,108,16,59,206,174,192,18,15,197,219,7,25,152,99,74]},"name":"Ma'am Darling_ 99 Glimpses of Princess Margaret by Craig Brown e","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
