She paints, she draws, she gets crushes on boys - until one night when Soviet officers barge into her home, tearing her family from the comfortable life they&apos;ve known. Separated from her father, forced onto a crowded and dirty train car, Lina, her mother, and her young brother slowly make their way north, crossing the Arctic Circle, to a work camp in the coldest reaches of Siberia. Here they are forced, under Stalin&apos;s orders, to dig for beets and fight for their lives under the cruelest of conditions.\r\n\r\nLina finds solace in her art, meticulously - and at great risk - documenting events by drawing, hoping these messages will make their way to her father&apos;s prison camp to let him know they are still alive. It is a long and harrowing journey, spanning years and covering 6,500 miles, but it is through incredible strength, love, and hope that Lina ultimately survives.\r\n\r\nBetween Shades of Gray is a novel that will steal your breath and capture your heart.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-08-31T12:00:32.891Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:3547ef5609350e961ba3ca1aa13d0ee2c52af82b","dn":"Between Shades of Gray by Ruta Sepetys ePUB MOBI eBOOK-ZAK","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"3547ef5609350e961ba3ca1aa13d0ee2c52af82b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,71,239,86,9,53,14,150,27,163,202,26,161,61,14,226,197,42,248,43]},"name":"Between Shades of Gray by Ruta Sepetys ePUB MOBI eBOOK-ZAK","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
