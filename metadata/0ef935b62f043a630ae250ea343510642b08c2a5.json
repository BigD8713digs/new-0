Unwilling to share the technology, the Kinahhi are pursuing their own agenda in the negotiations with Earth&#x2019;s diplomatic delegation.\r\n\r\nManeuvering through a maze of tyranny, terrorism and deceit, Dr Daniel Jackson, Major Samantha Carter and Teal&#x2019;c unravel a startling truth &#x2013; a revelation that throws the team into chaos and forces O&#x2019;Neill to face a nightmare he is determined to forget.\r\n\r\nResolved to rescue Boyd, O&#x2019;Neill marches back into the hell he swore never to revisit. Only this time, he&#x2019;s taking SG-1 with him&#x2026;\r\n\r\nA Matter of Honor\r\n&#x201C;Senator Kinsey has told me a lot about you and your team, Colonel.&#x201D; Crawford&#x2019;s voice was thin and nasal. It suited him. &#x201C;I look forward to giving him a full report on your methods.&#x201D;\r\n\r\n&#x201C;You haven&#x2019;t written it already?&#x201D;\r\n\r\nThe ambassador&#x2019;s lips compressed into a humorless smile and the silence stretched taut. Daniel rubbed at a sudden knot in the back of his neck and saw Sam&#x2019;s eyes flitting carefully between the two men. Like him, she smelled trouble.\r\n\r\nSergeant Davis broke the moment, his voice crackling over the PA system, &#x201C;Chevron seven, locked.&#x201D;\r\n\r\nJack didn&#x2019;t move, holding Crawford&#x2019;s gaze. Waiting. Daniel stepped back in anticipation, but Jack was barely in the safe-zone.\r\n\r\nHe always had to push it to the limit. And then, like an undersea volcano, the silver-blue event horizon mushroomed into the &#x2018;gate room, hitting an invisible wall mere inches from Jack&#x2019;s motionless head. Crawford yelped and stumbled backward in shock, his helmet flying free and clunking heavily onto the concrete floor.\r\n\r\n&#x201C;Holy crap!&#x201D; he gasped, struggling for balance and composure as the wormhole sucked back in on itself and eventually came to rest, shimmering brightly inside the Stargate.\r\n\r\nDaniel smiled; that just never got old.\r\n\r\nTurning his back on Crawford&#x2019;s alarmed face, Jack settled his weapon firmly in his hands. &#x201C;Let&#x2019;s go,&#x201D; he barked, striding up the ramp. &#x201C;Carter, with me. Daniel, Teal&#x2019;c &#x2013; bring the newbie. And Crawfish? Don&#x2019;t forget your hat.&#x201D;\r\n\r\n\r\nOfficial AnonCrypt accounts: <a href=\"\nhttps://1337x.to/user/AnonCrypt/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://1337x.to/user/AnonCrypt/</a> <a href=\"\nhttps://thepiratebay.org/user/AnonCrypt/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://thepiratebay.org/user/AnonCrypt/</a> <a href=\"\nhttps://katcr.co/user/AnonCrypt/profile/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://katcr.co/user/AnonCrypt/profile/</a> <a href=\"\nhttps://www.torrentfunk.com/user/anoncrypt.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://www.torrentfunk.com/user/anoncrypt.html</a>\r\n\r\n- Please see our newest torrents for an updated list","last_updated":"2018-07-03T12:08:30.937Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ef935b62f043a630ae250ea343510642b08c2a5","dn":"Stargate SG-1 - A Matter of Honor - SG1-03 - Fandemonium Ltd","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"0ef935b62f043a630ae250ea343510642b08c2a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,249,53,182,47,4,58,99,10,226,80,234,52,53,16,100,43,8,194,165]},"name":"Stargate SG-1 - A Matter of Honor - SG1-03 - Fandemonium Ltd","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
