In How to Be Free, A. A. Long&#x2015;one of the world&#x2019;s leading authorities on Stoicism and a pioneer in its remarkable contemporary revival&#x2015;provides a superb new edition of Epictetus&#x2019;s celebrated guide to the Stoic philosophy of life (the Encheiridion) along with a selection of related reflections in his Discourses.\r\n\r\nFreedom, for Epictetus, is not a human right or a political prerogative but a psychological and ethical achievement, a gift that we alone can bestow on ourselves. We can all be free, but only if we learn to assign paramount value to what we can control (our motivations and reactions), treat what we cannot control with equanimity, and view our circumstances as opportunities to do well and be well, no matter what happens to us through misfortune or the actions of other people.\r\n\r\nGenre: Non-Fiction &gt;  Politics &amp; Social Sciences","last_updated":"2018-11-23T12:13:35.204Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:a3ea4037b33339e926861bd9da21dd178097c3c3","dn":"How to Be Free: An Ancient Guide to ... by Epictetus (.epub) ","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"a3ea4037b33339e926861bd9da21dd178097c3c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,234,64,55,179,51,57,233,38,134,27,217,218,33,221,23,128,151,195,195]},"name":"How to Be Free: An Ancient Guide to ... by Epictetus (.epub) ","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
