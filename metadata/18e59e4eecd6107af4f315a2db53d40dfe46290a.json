It features a wide number of powerful, high and low-level libraries and frameworks that complement its delightful syntax and enable Python programmers to create. \r\n\r\nThis book introduces some of the most popular libraries and frameworks and goes in-depth into how you can leverage these libraries for your own high-concurrent, highly-performant Python programs. We&apos;ll cover the fundamental concepts of concurrency needed to be able to write your own concurrent and parallel software systems in Python. \r\n\r\nThe book will guide you down the path to mastering Python concurrency, giving you all the necessary hardware and theoretical knowledge. We&apos;ll cover concepts such as debugging and exception handling as well as some of the most popular libraries and frameworks that allow you to create event-driven and reactive systems. \r\n\r\nBy the end of the book, you&apos;ll have learned the techniques to write incredibly efficient concurrent systems that follow best practices. \r\n\r\nWhat you will learn: \r\n\r\n- Explore the concept of threading and multiprocessing in Python \r\n- Understand concurrency with threads \r\n- Manage exceptions in child threads \r\n- Handle the hardest part in a concurrent system &#x2014; shared resources \r\n- Build concurrent systems with Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) \r\n- Maintain all concurrent systems and master them \r\n- Apply reactive programming to build concurrent systems \r\n- Use GPU to solve specific problems","last_updated":"2017-11-01T12:09:42.336Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:18e59e4eecd6107af4f315a2db53d40dfe46290a","dn":"Learning Concurrency in Python [Mackweet]","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"18e59e4eecd6107af4f315a2db53d40dfe46290a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,229,158,78,236,214,16,122,244,243,21,162,219,83,212,13,254,70,41,10]},"name":"Learning Concurrency in Python [Mackweet]","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
