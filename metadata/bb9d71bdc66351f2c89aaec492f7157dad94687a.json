Infected people - &quot;shakes&quot; - attacked the living and created havoc and destruction. No one has ever survived the infection.\r\n\r\nDaisy Wilcox, known as Willie, has been protecting her siblings within the relatively safe walls of Glory, Texas. But when Willie&apos;s good-for-nothing father steals a fortune from one of the most dangerous shake-hunters in town, she finds herself on the hook for his debt. With two hunters, including the gruff and handsome Ben, to accompany her, she sets out across the desert in search of her father. But the desert is not kind to travelers, and not everyone will pass through alive.\r\n\r\nWestern meets horror for this riveting story about survival, family, and inner strength. High concept and character-driven, Emma Berquist&apos;s debut will satisfy fans of The Magnificent Seven, Rae Carson&apos;s Walk on Earth a Stranger, and HBO&apos;s Westworld.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-04-13T16:04:07.572Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb9d71bdc66351f2c89aaec492f7157dad94687a","dn":"Devils Unto Dust by Emma Berquist EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"bb9d71bdc66351f2c89aaec492f7157dad94687a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,157,113,189,198,99,81,242,200,154,174,196,146,247,21,125,173,148,104,122]},"name":"Devils Unto Dust by Emma Berquist EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
