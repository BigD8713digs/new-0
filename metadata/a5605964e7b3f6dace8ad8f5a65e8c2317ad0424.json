She has an\r\neye for details and a knack for narrative that help keep her brand of\r\ntraditionalism from seeming like nostalgia on her debut, &quot;Midwest Farmer&apos;s\r\nDaughter&quot;, an album recorded at Sun Studios and released on Jack White&apos;s\r\nThird Man Records in 2016. &quot;Midwest Farmer&apos;s Daughter&quot; was cut on Price&apos;s\r\nown dime, hawking everything she and her husband had to record the album at\r\nSun Studio\r\n\r\nIts rawness grabbed the attention of Third Man Records, which released the\r\nrecord unadorned. Critics and a cult of fans also found the rough edges\r\nappealing, but that ragged immediacy also suggested Price was more of a\r\ntraditionalist than she actually was, a situation she remedies with 2017&apos;s\r\n&quot;All American Made&quot;. Written and recorded in the aftermath of Donald J\r\nTrump&apos;s November 2016 election, &quot;All American Made&quot; doesn&apos;t disguise\r\nPrice&apos;s liberal politics - &quot;Pay Gap&quot; addresses gender inequality among\r\nsalaries, the title track is a stark bit of protest that reaches its boil\r\nthanks to sampled news clips - which is a shift from the personal vignettes\r\nof her debut, and she broadens her musical range, too\r\n\r\nPrice is particularly drawn to laid-back slow, going so far as to set\r\n&quot;Cocaine Cowboys&quot; to a lackadaisical funk beat. She hasn&apos;t abandoned\r\ncountry - the album opens with the rockabilly of &quot;Don&apos;t Say It&quot;, which is\r\nquickly countered by the barroom swing of &quot;Weakness&quot;, while Willie Nelson\r\nlater swings by to sing on &quot;Learning To Lose&quot; - which means &quot;All American\r\nMade&quot; winds up drawing an expansive portrait of American roots music, one\r\nthat touches on R&amp;B, Tex-Mex, girl group pop, spacy indie rock, and even\r\nGlen Campbell&apos;s trippiest moments\r\n\r\nPrice isn&apos;t a dilettante; these disparate styles are unified by a musical\r\nand lyrical aesthetic that views American life not only as a continuum, but\r\na place where the past and present, rural and urban are in constant\r\ndialogue. Despite some deservedly hard edges, it&apos;s this vision of an\r\nopen-hearted, open-bordered USA that gives &quot;All American Made&quot; its lasting","last_updated":"2017-12-22T12:06:49.771Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5605964e7b3f6dace8ad8f5a65e8c2317ad0424","dn":"DEAD OR ALIVE 5 Last Round Core Fighters TECMO 50th Anniversary ","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"a5605964e7b3f6dace8ad8f5a65e8c2317ad0424","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,96,89,100,231,179,246,218,206,138,216,245,166,94,140,35,23,173,4,36]},"name":"DEAD OR ALIVE 5 Last Round Core Fighters TECMO 50th Anniversary ","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
