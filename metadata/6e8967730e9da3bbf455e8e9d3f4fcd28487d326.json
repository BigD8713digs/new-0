Her largely self-taught approach is by now familiar, but the outcome still sounds fresh and inventive, with a strong sense of emerging form. Her partner in the group is another radical autodidact, French alto saxophonist Heddy Boubaker. On Axon&apos;s seven tracks, recorded in Hamburg in July 2010, they are heard in microscopic close-up and seem to be running off the same circuit. That&apos;s an apt metaphor: in cellular biology, an axon is a fibre conducting electrical impulses from a nerve cell; while myelin is a tissue that enhances the process. It&apos;s easy enough to conceive this elusive yet engrossing music as a custom-made soundtrack for the agitated transmission of neural electricity. - Julian Cowley, The Wire","last_updated":"2017-07-08T12:01:21.334Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e8967730e9da3bbf455e8e9d3f4fcd28487d326","dn":"Birgit Ulher &amp; Heddy Boubaker 2011 Myelin: Axon","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"6e8967730e9da3bbf455e8e9d3f4fcd28487d326","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,137,103,115,14,157,163,187,244,85,232,233,211,244,252,210,132,135,211,38]},"name":"Birgit Ulher &amp; Heddy Boubaker 2011 Myelin: Axon","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
