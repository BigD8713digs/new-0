Macaluso PhD\r\n\r\nRequirements: .ePUB reader\r\n\r\nOverview: Few prominent Americans are as associated with a place as Thomas Jefferson is with Virginia. The heart of &quot;Jefferson Country&quot; is his house and plantation at Monticello, but Jefferson traveled the breadth of his home state, from his time at William &amp; Mary in Williamsburg to the new state capital at Richmond and his retreat and plantation at Poplar Forest, near Lynchburg. In the beauty of the Blue Ridge Mountains, Jefferson was inspired to write his only book, Notes on the State of Virginia. Laura A. Macaluso demonstrates the many facets of the man, the scholar and the statesman in this guide to the Virginia he loved.\r\n\r\nGenre: Non-Fiction &gt; General","last_updated":"2018-10-11T12:14:49.600Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d910edbb1b068bd9000b629d47282561b0b0f73","dn":"Thomas Jefferson's Virginia by Laura A.
