It lets you quickly see which groups and users have access to which directories and allows you to export this information to file for further reviewing. Permissions Reporter 2 now offers advanced permissions report filtering capabilities, allowing you to find exactly what you&#x2019;re looking for while excluding information that is not of interest to you. Filters can be applied either at scan-time (when defined at the project level) or post-scan (after the report is generated) to produce exactly what you need, when you need it.\r\n\r\nFilter usage examples:\r\n\r\n    Report on permissions not conforming to your company&#x2019;s security policies\r\n    Report on folders with permissions assigned to accounts that no longer exist\r\n    Exclude specific accounts and permissions by name or security identifier\r\n    Report on accounts that are specifically allowed or denied file system access\r\n    Much more!\r\n\r\nADDITIONAL IMPROVEMENTS:\r\n\r\n    Added an &#x201C;Analyze with Permissions Reporter&#x201D; shortcut for folders (and drives) within the Windows shell.\r\n    XML export and import functions have been updated to include group member data (when enabled).\r\n    Excel export now includes an optional sheet that contains group membership (linked to from within the folder report)","last_updated":"2018-09-20T12:13:16.229Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:62334ed577cc87595a1bcaa6ddcf96ecc01f0b50","dn":"Cjwdev NTFS Permissions Reporter 2.8.198.0 Enterprise Edition Fu","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"62334ed577cc87595a1bcaa6ddcf96ecc01f0b50","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,51,78,213,119,204,135,89,90,27,202,166,221,207,150,236,192,31,11,80]},"name":"Cjwdev NTFS Permissions Reporter 2.8.198.0 Enterprise Edition Fu","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
