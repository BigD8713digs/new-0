Price\r\n\r\nOriginally published in France in 1964, The Tenant chronicles a harrowing, fascinating descent into madness as the pathologically alienated Trelkovsky is subsumed into Simone Choule, and enigmatic suicide whose baleful presence still saturates his new apartment. Much more than a tale of possession, the novel probes disturbing depths of guilt, paranoia, and sexual obsession with an unsparing, almost clinical detachment. This densely textured work was brilliantly adapted for the screen by Roman Polanski in 1976","last_updated":"2018-01-03T12:04:11.868Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f7a0360161675325842c2d9112355e9bb7492dc","dn":"The Tenant by Rolanor","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"5f7a0360161675325842c2d9112355e9bb7492dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,122,3,96,22,22,117,50,88,66,194,217,17,35,85,233,187,116,146,220]},"name":"The Tenant by Rolanor","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
