Its economy depends on the power of the captive spirit Seedless, an andat bound to the poet-sorcerer Heshai for life. Enter the Galts, an empire committed to laying waste to all lands with their ferocious army. Saraykeht has always been too strong for the Galts to attack, but now they see an opportunity.\r\n\r\nIf they can dispose of Heshai, Seedless will perish and the entire city will fall. In the middle is Otah, a simple laborer with a complex past. Recruited to act as a bodyguard for his girlfriend&apos;s boss at a secret meeting, he inadvertently learns of the Galtish plot. Otah finds himself as the sole hope of Saraykeht: either he stops the Galts or the whole city and everyone in it perishes forever.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-08-05T12:00:28.709Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:dadad0f498172b1045f852788dceee84cf842da2","dn":"A Shadow in Summer (Long Price Quartet series_book 1) by Daniel ","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"dadad0f498172b1045f852788dceee84cf842da2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,218,208,244,152,23,43,16,69,248,82,120,141,206,238,132,207,132,45,162]},"name":"A Shadow in Summer (Long Price Quartet series_book 1) by Daniel ","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
