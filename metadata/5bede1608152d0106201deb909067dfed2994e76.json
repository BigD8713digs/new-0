Four people who come together on New Year&apos;s Eve: a former TV talk show host, a musician, a teenage girl, and a mother. Three are British, one is American. They encounter one another on the roof of Topper&apos;s House, a London destination famous as the last stop for those ready to end their lives.\r\n\r\nIn four distinct and riveting first-person voices, Nick Hornby tells a story of four individuals confronting the limits of choice, circumstance, and their own mortality. This is a tale of connections made and missed, punishing regrets, and the grace of second chances.\r\n\r\nIntense, hilarious, provocative, and moving, A Long Way Down is a novel about suicide that is, surprisingly, full of life.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-07-05T12:01:18.875Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:5bede1608152d0106201deb909067dfed2994e76","dn":"A Long Way Down by Nick Hornby epub RtR","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"5bede1608152d0106201deb909067dfed2994e76","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,237,225,96,129,82,208,16,98,1,222,185,9,6,125,254,210,153,78,118]},"name":"A Long Way Down by Nick Hornby epub RtR","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
