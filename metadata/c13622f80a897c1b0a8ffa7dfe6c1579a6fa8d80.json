He has a gigantic heart, two-inch horns, and an occasional problem with fainting. His nickname is Weak Sauce and his Will to Power ranking is Snacklicious--the lowest in his class. But Gork is determined not to let any of this hold him back as he embarks on the most important mission of his life: tonight, on the eve of his high school graduation, he must ask a female dragon to be his queen. If she says yes, they&apos;ll go off to conquer a foreign planet together. If she says no, Gork becomes a slave. \r\n\r\nVying with Jocks, Nerds, Mutants, and Multi-Dimensioners to find his mate, Gork encounters an unforgettable cast of friends and foes, including Dr. Terrible, the mad scientist; Fribby, a robot dragon obsessed with death; and Metheldra, a healer specializing in acupuncture with swords. But finally it is Gork&apos;s biggest perceived weakness, his huge heart, that will guide him through his epic quest and help him reach his ultimate destination: planet Earth","last_updated":"2017-08-04T12:02:16.063Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:c13622f80a897c1b0a8ffa7dfe6c1579a6fa8d80","dn":"Gork, the Teenage Dragon ~ Gabe Hudson [Shades]epub","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"c13622f80a897c1b0a8ffa7dfe6c1579a6fa8d80","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,54,34,248,10,137,124,27,10,143,250,125,254,108,21,121,166,250,141,128]},"name":"Gork, the Teenage Dragon ~ Gabe Hudson [Shades]epub","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
