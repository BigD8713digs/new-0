It addresses questions including the syntactic location of gender features; the role of natural gender; and the relationship between syntactic gender features and the morphological realization of gender. Ruth Kramer argues that gender features are syntactically located on the n head (`little n`), which serves to nominalize category-neutral roots. Those gender\r\nfeatures are either interpretable, as in the case of natural gender, or uninterpretable, like the gender of an inanimate noun in Spanish. Adopting Distributed Morphology, the book lays out how the gender features on n map onto the gender features relevant for morphological exponence.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n <a href=\"\nhttp://dlfeb.com/book/morphosyntax-of-gender-oxford-studies-in-theoretical-linguistics/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttp://dlfeb.com/book/morphosyntax-of-gender-oxford-studies-in-theoretical-linguistics/</a>","last_updated":"2017-07-23T12:01:19.145Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee67f5feec62074ffe4d0be62e4cd0cc49b201fd","dn":"THE MORPHOSYNTAX OF GENDER ","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"ee67f5feec62074ffe4d0be62e4cd0cc49b201fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,103,245,254,236,98,7,79,254,77,11,230,46,76,208,204,73,178,1,253]},"name":"THE MORPHOSYNTAX OF GENDER ","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
