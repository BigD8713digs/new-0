The team is skeptical, but Keith assures them that his knowledge of the house will help them flip it fast so they can target families with kids prior to the new school year. A series of problems and delays create a race against time that makes an end-of-summer completion nearly impossible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal Air Date: 06-Feb-2016","last_updated":"2017-06-12T12:06:58.749Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:059e2ed934159d459e10c3f5b661cd01fb885351","dn":"Zombie.House.Flipping.S01E02.Blood.Sweetbriar.and.Tears.REPACK.4","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"059e2ed934159d459e10c3f5b661cd01fb885351","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,158,46,217,52,21,157,69,158,16,195,245,182,97,205,1,251,136,83,81]},"name":"Zombie.House.Flipping.S01E02.Blood.Sweetbriar.and.Tears.REPACK.4","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
