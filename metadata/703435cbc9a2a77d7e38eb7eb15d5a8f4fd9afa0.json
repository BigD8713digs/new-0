They have 15 days to tackle this ancient 780km path across northern Spain to the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela and the shrine of St James. But will this journey of a lifetime change the way they think about themselves and their faith, as well as exploring whether a medieval pilgrimage has any relevance in the modern day?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPilgrimage: The Road to Santiago - Series 1, Episode 1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSeven celebrities don their backpacks to find out whether a medieval pilgrimage still has relevance today, taking on a 780km trek across northern Spain over 15 days. Actor Neil Morrissey, entertainer Debbie McGee, comedian Ed Byrne, singer Heather Small, the Rev Kate Bottley, journalist Raphael Rowe and TV presenter JJ Chalmers start by walking the most gruelling part of the Camino, a 26km hike, following a mountain pass from France into Spain that takes them to a height of 1,400m.They are shown a copy of the ancient Codex Calixtinus, a medieval guide to the route, before heading to the Pilgrims&apos; Office where they register and collect their all-important pilgrim passports, which they&apos;ll get stamped where ever they stop along the way. Each day ends with a stay in a basic hostel, sleeping in dormitories on bunkbeds. Narrated by Lee Ingleby.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal Air Date: 16-Mar-2018","last_updated":"2018-03-18T12:04:23.310Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:703435cbc9a2a77d7e38eb7eb15d5a8f4fd9afa0","dn":"Pilgrimage.The.Road.to.Santiago.S01E01.WEB-DL.x264-JIVE.mp4","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"703435cbc9a2a77d7e38eb7eb15d5a8f4fd9afa0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,52,53,203,201,162,167,125,126,56,235,126,177,93,90,143,79,217,175,160]},"name":"Pilgrimage.The.Road.to.Santiago.S01E01.WEB-DL.x264-JIVE.mp4","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
