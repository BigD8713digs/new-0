It sounds strange because it is, and it is because I am strange.\r\n\r\nAfter the sudden collapse of her family, Mim Malone is dragged from her home in Northern Ohio to the wastelands of Mississippi, where she lives in a medicated milieu with her dad and new stepmom. Before the dust has a chance to settle, she learns her mother is sick back in Cleveland.\r\n\r\nSo she ditches her new life and hops aboard a northbound Greyhound bus to her real home and her real mother, meeting a quirky cast of fellow travelers along the way. But when her thousand-mile journey takes a few turns she could never see coming, Mim must confront her own demons, redefining her notions of love, loyalty, and what it means to be sane.\r\n\r\nTold in an unforgettable, kaleidoscopic voice, Mosquitoland is a modern American odyssey, as hilarious as it is heartbreaking.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-07-03T12:12:48.455Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:3efebca4d7c0f43aaa3aa421e3678e8a6092480e","dn":"Mosquitoland by David Arnold EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"3efebca4d7c0f43aaa3aa421e3678e8a6092480e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,254,188,164,215,192,244,58,170,58,164,33,227,103,142,138,96,146,72,14]},"name":"Mosquitoland by David Arnold EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
