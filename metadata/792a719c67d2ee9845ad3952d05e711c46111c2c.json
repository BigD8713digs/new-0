But life as an overworked, undervalued sous chef at a reality star&#x2019;s New York bakery is not what Sam dreamed. \r\n\r\nWhen the chef embarrasses Sam, she quits and returns home. Unemployed, single, and defeated, she spends a summer working on her family&#x2019;s orchard, cooking and baking alongside the women in her life - including her mother, Deana, and grandmother, Willo. One beloved, flour-flecked, ink-smeared recipe at a time, Sam begins to learn about and understand the women in her life, her family&#x2019;s history, and her passion for food through their treasured recipe box. As Sam discovers what matters most, she opens her heart to a man she left behind but who now might be the key to her happiness.  \r\n\r\nThe Recipe Box is a warm and heartfelt book readers will love.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-03-24T12:02:15.230Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:792a719c67d2ee9845ad3952d05e711c46111c2c","dn":"The Recipe Box: A Novel by Viola Shipman EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"792a719c67d2ee9845ad3952d05e711c46111c2c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,42,113,156,103,210,238,152,69,173,57,82,208,94,113,28,70,17,28,44]},"name":"The Recipe Box: A Novel by Viola Shipman EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
