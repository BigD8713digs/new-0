We fail to understand how deeply God cares about our spouse. We diminish our need to not only understand what biblical love really is, but also to become a people who excel at it. We let ourselves drift apart instead of making the daily choices to grow closer together. Whether your marriage needs a complete makeover, a touch up, or just a new purpose, A Lifelong Love promises to set your relationship on an entirely new dimension. You will never look at worship or your spouse in the same way again. You will understand how living for that day will so radically transform the decisions you make this day. And Gary will guide you through the power shifts and seasonal mine fields that blow up so many marriages so that you can grow in your love instead of in your disappointment. Thirty years of study and two decades of working with couples has led Gary Thomas to his most significant book yet on the relationship between husband and wife. Find out for yourself what all the fuss is about - and why A Lifelong Love is sure to challenge the way the church talks about marriage.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-03-12T12:03:35.305Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:21f2d8e2ffd9de908eeebecad8ef34f84a4fec22","dn":"A Lifelong Love by Gary Thomas EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"21f2d8e2ffd9de908eeebecad8ef34f84a4fec22","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,242,216,226,255,217,222,144,142,238,190,202,216,239,52,248,74,79,236,34]},"name":"A Lifelong Love by Gary Thomas EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
