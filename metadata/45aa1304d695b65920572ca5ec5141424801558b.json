A print edition was published from 1982 to January 2009. Publication of online editions started in late 1994 and continues to this day.\r\nIn an early review of the new IBM PC, Byte reported &quot;the announcement of a new magazine called PC: The Independent Guide to the IBM Personal Computer. It is published by David Bunnell, of Software Communications, Inc. ... It should be of great interest to owners of the IBM Personal Computer&quot;.The first issue of PC, dated February&#x2013;March 1982, appeared early that year. (The word Magazine was not added to the logo until the first major redesign in January 1986). PC Magazine was created by Bunnell and Cheryl Woodard, who also helped David found the subsequent PC World and Macworld magazines. Eddie Currie and Tony Gold, a co-founder of Lifeboat Associates who financed the magazine, were early investors in PC Magazine. The magazine grew beyond the capital required to publish it, and to solve this problem, Gold sold the magazine to Ziff-Davis who moved it[clarification needed] to New York City, New York. Bunnell and his staff left to form PC World magazine.[","last_updated":"2017-06-21T12:01:26.733Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:45aa1304d695b65920572ca5ec5141424801558b","dn":"PC.com - June 2017 - True PDF - zeke23","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"45aa1304d695b65920572ca5ec5141424801558b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,170,19,4,214,149,182,89,32,87,44,165,236,81,65,66,72,1,85,139]},"name":"PC.com - June 2017 - True PDF - zeke23","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
