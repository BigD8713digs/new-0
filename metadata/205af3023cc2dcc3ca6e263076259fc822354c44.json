The widow of a resister murdered in the failed July 20, 1944, plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler, Marianne plans to uphold the promise she made to her husband&apos;s brave conspirators: to find and protect their wives, her fellow resistance widows.\r\n\r\nFirst Marianne rescues six-year-old Martin, the son of her dearest childhood friend, from a Nazi reeducation home. Together they make their way across the smoldering wreckage of their homeland to Berlin, where Martin&apos;s mother, the beautiful and naive Benita, has fallen into the hands of occupying Red Army soldiers. Then she locates Ania, another resister&apos;s wife, and her two boys, now refugees languishing in one of the many camps that house the millions displaced by the war.\r\n\r\nAs Marianne assembles this makeshift family from the ruins of her husband&apos;s resistance movement, she is certain their shared pain and circumstances will hold them together. But she quickly discovers that the black-and-white, highly principled world of her privileged past has become infinitely more complicated, filled with secrets and dark passions that threaten to tear them apart. Eventually all three women must come to terms with the choices that have defined their lives before, during, and after the war - each with her own unique share of challenges.\r\n\r\nWritten with the devastating emotional power of The Nightingale, Sarah&apos;s Key, and The Light Between Oceans, Jessica Shattuck&apos;s evocative and utterly enthralling novel offers a fresh perspective on one of the most tumultuous periods in history. Combining piercing social insight and vivid historical atmosphere, The Women in the Castle is a dramatic yet nuanced portrait of war and its repercussions that explores what it means to survive, love, and ultimately forgive in the wake of unimaginable hardship.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-09-22T12:00:55.346Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:205af3023cc2dcc3ca6e263076259fc822354c44","dn":"The Women in the Castle by Jessica Shattuck ePUB eBOOK-ZAK","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"205af3023cc2dcc3ca6e263076259fc822354c44","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,90,243,2,60,194,220,195,202,110,38,48,118,37,159,200,34,53,76,68]},"name":"The Women in the Castle by Jessica Shattuck ePUB eBOOK-ZAK","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
