Biblical references to her are tantalizingly brief, but we do know that she was the first person to whom the risen Christ appeared - and the one commissioned to tell others the good news, earning her the ancient honorific &quot;Apostle to the Apostles&quot;. Today, Mary continues to spark controversy, curiosity, and veneration. In a vivid re-creation of Mary Magdalene&apos;s life story, Margaret George convincingly captures this renowned woman&apos;s voice as she moves from girlhood to womanhood, becomes part of the circle of disciples, and comes to grips with the divine. Grounded in biblical scholarship and secular research, this fascinating historical novel is also, ultimately, &quot;the diary of a soul&quot;.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-09-09T12:01:16.976Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d8a913775947f4d13366d9b3ef34a158e136f10","dn":"Mary, Called Magdalene by Margaret George EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"3d8a913775947f4d13366d9b3ef34a158e136f10","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,138,145,55,117,148,127,77,19,54,109,155,62,243,74,21,142,19,111,16]},"name":"Mary, Called Magdalene by Margaret George EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
