But he was the herd&apos;s last chance of survival: they would be killed if he wouldn&apos;t take them. In order to save their lives, Anthony took them in. In the years that followed he became a part of their family. And as he battled to create a bond with the elephants, he came to realize that they had a great deal to teach him about life, loyalty, and freedom.\r\n\r\nThe Elephant Whisperer is a heartwarming, exciting, funny, and sometimes sad account of Anthony&apos;s experiences with these huge yet sympathetic creatures. Set against the background of life on an African game reserve, with unforgettable characters and exotic wildlife, it is a delightful book that will appeal to animal lovers and adventurous souls everywhere.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-12-11T12:06:42.209Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:3caaf4812bbff599f6c761dec8408eb185ead035","dn":"The Elephant Whisperer by Lawrence Anthony, Graham Spence EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"3caaf4812bbff599f6c761dec8408eb185ead035","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,170,244,129,43,191,245,153,246,199,97,222,200,64,142,177,133,234,208,53]},"name":"The Elephant Whisperer by Lawrence Anthony, Graham Spence EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
