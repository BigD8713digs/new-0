Adam moved to France to follow his dream, unencumbered by a serious relationship and the child he never wanted.\r\n\r\nTen years later, Susan, Jess&apos;s mother, lies in a nursing home, battling a debilitating disease. Susan forces Jess to recognize what she&apos;s always refused to acknowledge: that William needs his father in his life. \r\n\r\nSo, Jess and 10-year-old William set off to spend the summer at Ch&#xE2;teau de Roussignol, deep in the rich, sunlit hills of the Dordogne, where Adam runs a beautiful hotel. There, Jess has a mission: to make Adam fall in love with his own son. \r\n\r\nBy turns heartbreaking and hopeful, You Me Everything is a novel about one woman&apos;s fierce determination to grab hold of the family she has, and a romantic story about finding love even under the most unexpected circumstances.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-07-16T12:01:12.373Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:407a1b81de20280f8ffbe8202e4b2628578f125d","dn":"You Me Everything by Catherine Isaac EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"407a1b81de20280f8ffbe8202e4b2628578f125d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,122,27,129,222,32,40,15,143,251,232,32,46,75,38,40,87,143,18,93]},"name":"You Me Everything by Catherine Isaac EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
