Valiant Dust combines the intrigues of interstellar colonial diplomacy with explosive military action.\r\n\r\nSikander Singh North has always had it easy - until he joined the crew of the Aquilan Commonwealth starship CSS Hector. As the ship&apos;s new gunnery officer and only Kashmiri, he must constantly prove himself better than his Aquilan crewmates, even if he has to use his fists. When the Hector is called to help with a planetary uprising, he&apos;ll have to earn his unit&apos;s respect, find who&apos;s arming the rebels, and deal with the headstrong daughter of the colonial ruler - all while dodging bullets.\r\n\r\nSikander&apos;s military career is off to an explosive start - but only if he and CSS Hector can survive his first mission.
