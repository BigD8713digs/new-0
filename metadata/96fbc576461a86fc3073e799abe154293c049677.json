People are dying - covered in blood, their faces frozen in fear. But with not a wound on their bodies.\r\n\r\nBattling creatures of the dark is the job of the local spook, but 17-year-old Thomas Ward never finished his apprenticeship. It will be no easy task to earn the trust of the villagers and to defeat a monster that no one has ever seen.\r\n\r\nYet Jenny - a seventh daughter of a seventh daughter - knows an awful lot about this new evil. And she&apos;s willing to share what she&apos;s learned with Tom&#x2026;if he takes her on as his apprentice. No girl has ever been a spook&apos;s apprentice before. But vanquishing this creature will take Tom and Jenny far from home. And that&apos;s exactly what Jenny wants.\r\n\r\nThis new arc in the legend of Thomas Ward, the hero of the best-selling The Last Apprentice series, begins a dark and sweeping adventure that will chill your very soul.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-09-22T12:32:18.105Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:96fbc576461a86fc3073e799abe154293c049677","dn":"A New Darkness by Joseph Delaney EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"96fbc576461a86fc3073e799abe154293c049677","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,251,197,118,70,26,134,252,48,115,231,153,171,225,84,41,60,4,150,119]},"name":"A New Darkness by Joseph Delaney EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
