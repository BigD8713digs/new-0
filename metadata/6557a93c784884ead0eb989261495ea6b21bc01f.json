What would they tell us to soothe our sorrow, calm our fears of what happens when we die, and fire us up to live the best possible lives now? With wisdom, humor, and, yes, joy, New York Times best-selling author Mike Dooley explores our most pressing and profound questions about the afterlife - and this life - from the fresh perspective of those who have made the transition to the next phase. Revelations they share:\r\n\r\nWe were ready; you are not.\r\nThere&apos;s no such thing as a devil or hell.\r\nWe&apos;re sorry for any pain we may have caused.\r\nYour pets are just as crazy, brilliant, and loving here as they were there.\r\nNothing can prepare you for the beauty of the moment you arrive.\r\n\r\nIn this book, you&apos;ll learn that our loved ones are not lost to us; that our time on earth is both a school and an adventure; and that we can reshape our own fortunes, starting today.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-09-05T12:03:47.593Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:6557a93c784884ead0eb989261495ea6b21bc01f","dn":"The Top Ten Things Dead People Want to Tell You by Mike Dooley e","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"6557a93c784884ead0eb989261495ea6b21bc01f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,87,169,60,120,72,132,234,208,235,152,146,97,73,94,166,178,27,192,31]},"name":"The Top Ten Things Dead People Want to Tell You by Mike Dooley e","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
