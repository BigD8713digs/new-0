L. Longworth and Juliet Blackwell.  \n\nThe only thing chillier than a Parisian winter is cold-blooded murder.  \n\nWhen French financier Edgar Bowen drowns in a bowl of soup, his former girlfriend, American Rachel Levis, is alarmed by the unnatural death. Who dies eating a nice vichyssoise? But when she overhears a mourner at his funeral describing the circumstances of his death, something sounds even stranger: a bottle of rose was on the dining table when he died. The only problem: Edgar loathed rose. If he wasn&apos;t drinking it, who was?  \n\nAfter the police rule the death accidental, Rachel knows it&apos;s up to her and her best friend, Magda, to investigate. As the two Americans immerse themselves in Edgar&apos;s upper-class world, the list of suspects grows: could it have been his son, who inherited his money and lavish apartment? His icy ex-wife? His greedy new girlfriend? His impoverished personal assistant? \n\nBut when the suspects start dropping like flies, Rachel and Magda realise the murderer is tying up loose ends. It&apos;ll be up to two amateur sleuths to solve their first case before the murderer decides they&apos;re next.... \n\nxx","last_updated":"2018-10-13T12:21:30.192Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c26ca82402adf153823a72673fc71178f5c5b98","dn":"Death in Paris by Emilia Bernhard EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"2c26ca82402adf153823a72673fc71178f5c5b98","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,38,202,130,64,42,223,21,56,35,167,38,115,252,113,23,143,92,91,152]},"name":"Death in Paris by Emilia Bernhard EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
