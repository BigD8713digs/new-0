Meanwhile, a horticulturist, heir to the Great Migration that brought masses of African Americans to Detroit, and her husband, a product of the white flight from it, have turned to urban farming to revitalize the blighted city they both love. And near Missoula, Montana, a couple who have been at the forefront of organic farming for decades navigate what it means to live and raise a family ethically.\r\n\r\nA work of immersive journalism steeped in a distinctively American social history and sparked by a personal quest, The Unsettlers traces the search for the simple life through the stories of these new pioneers and what inspired each of them to look for - or create - a better existence. Captivating and clear-eyed, it dares us to imagine what a sustainable, ethical, authentic future might actually look like","last_updated":"2017-05-24T11:19:44.749Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:9723367521a066358971be02475e3f88a94174ba","dn":"Mark Sundeen - The Unsettlers 2017 RETAiL ePUB eBOOK-DiSTRiBUTiO","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"9723367521a066358971be02475e3f88a94174ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,35,54,117,33,160,102,53,137,113,190,2,71,94,63,136,169,65,116,186]},"name":"Mark Sundeen - The Unsettlers 2017 RETAiL ePUB eBOOK-DiSTRiBUTiO","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
