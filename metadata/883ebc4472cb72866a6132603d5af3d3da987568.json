Men and women, young and old, have a deep fascination with the species that roamed Earth before us. In this book, paleontologist Dr. Kenneth Lacovara takes readers on a journey - back to when dinosaurs roamed the Earth - to reveal how dinosaurs achieved feats unparalleled by any other group of animals.\r\n\r\nLacovara shows why these sublimely adaptable, remarkable creatures deserve our awe and respect.
