Extreme Teams looks at the new generation of teams driving growth in today&apos;s most innovative firms. They do this by doing things differently: hiring the right person instead of the best person; focusing on one priority while leaving room to explore new ideas; creating an environment where people are comfortable dealing with the uncomfortable; and maximizing profit by not making profit what matters most. The book takes you inside top companies and examines the teamwork experiments powering their results, including how:\r\n\r\nPixar&apos;s teams use constant feedback and debate to transform initially flawed films into billion-dollar hits...\r\n\r\nA culture of radical &quot;freedom and responsibility&quot; helps Netflix execute on the next big thing...\r\n\r\nWhole Foods&apos; super-autonomous teams embrace hard metrics and friendly competition to drive performance...\r\n\r\nZappos fuels the weirdness and fun that sustains its success...\r\n\r\nTimes change, and so must teams. Designing and managing high-performance teams requires upgrading outdated beliefs and behaviors, and spurring a level of intensity and collaboration that lets them face down any challenge.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-10-05T12:03:34.690Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:d52117d7bcda5bb5a6606c2f1b8d252dd6e1a293","dn":"Extreme Teams_ Why Pixar, Netflix, Airbnb, and Other Cutting-Edg","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"d52117d7bcda5bb5a6606c2f1b8d252dd6e1a293","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,33,23,215,188,218,91,181,166,96,108,47,27,141,37,45,214,225,162,147]},"name":"Extreme Teams_ Why Pixar, Netflix, Airbnb, and Other Cutting-Edg","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
