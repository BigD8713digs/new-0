Hardly, argues environmental lawyer turned rancher Nicolette Hahn Niman in her new book, Defending Beef.\r\n\r\nThe public has long been led to believe that livestock, especially cattle, erode soils, pollute air and water, damage riparian areas, and decimate wildlife populations.\r\n\r\nIn Defending Beef, Hahn Niman argues that cattle are not inherently bad for either the Earth or our own nutritional health. In fact, properly managed livestock play an essential role in maintaining grassland ecosystems by functioning as surrogates for herds of wild ruminants that once covered the globe. Hahn Niman argues that dispersed, grass-fed, small-scale farms can and should become the basis for American food production, replacing the factory farms that harm animals and the environment.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-10-02T12:02:34.257Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:a481cf60111a5efa84f4776c622de611b78322b9","dn":"Defending Beef_ the Case for Sustainable Meat Production by Nico","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"a481cf60111a5efa84f4776c622de611b78322b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,129,207,96,17,26,94,250,132,244,119,108,98,45,230,17,183,131,34,185]},"name":"Defending Beef_ the Case for Sustainable Meat Production by Nico","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
