La Rochelle is also considered a &quot;landing patch&quot; for some of the world&apos;s darkest manifestations of fear that are guided into the world by an ancient malefactor. That gives the Hastings more to do than just plan funerals, as they also handle &quot;afterlife care&quot; for the unexpected deaths that people suffer at the hands of demonic entities and other unworldly phenomena. The family uses arcane weaponry, incredible strength and a deep knowledge of the occult to quell the evil that lies within the town.\r\n\r\nFirst episode date: 6 October 2017\r\nNetwork: Syfy\r\nProduction location: New Orleans\r\nGenre: Drama\r\nProgram creators: Mario Van Peebles, Joel Anderson Thompson","last_updated":"2017-11-05T12:09:07.171Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:34e30be884ec087942aa5c85d5efbf5dc5520208","dn":"Superstition.S01E03.HDTV.x264.[Season.1.Episode.3]","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"34e30be884ec087942aa5c85d5efbf5dc5520208","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,227,11,232,132,236,8,121,66,170,92,133,213,239,191,93,197,82,2,8]},"name":"Superstition.S01E03.HDTV.x264.[Season.1.Episode.3]","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
