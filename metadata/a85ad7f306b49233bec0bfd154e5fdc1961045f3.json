Their debut album Endless Grey boasts a sound filled with reverb, echoes, ethereal vocals, and melancholia, although it is not a completely grim affair. Their songs are comparable to a 4AD-infused Low or a Cure-drenched Red House Painters, all with a touch of Cocteau Twins&#x2019; ethereal dreamscapes. \r\nLead singer and songwriter Red Collier describes the album as, &#x201C;&#x2026;Our little fingerprint on the reemerging dream pop and shoegaze scene. It is very much a labor of love that is different than so many of these redux based bands. We missed the eighties by almost thirty years, but we hope that this release both carries the torch of all our favorite bands, as well as pushes the envelope of all they have built.&#x201D; \r\n\r\nThere are certain thematic elements that recur throughout the album including water, rain, clouds, and floods, as well as isolation, existential angst, and escape. Hazily drawn out male vocals, at times buoyed by airier female vocal accompaniment, float though the dreamily drifting to melancholically hanging soundscapes. The mood is calm to pensive, inwardly-gazing at the vast expanse of the mind. Endless Grey is continuously hypnotically absorbing. \r\n\r\nTracklist: \r\n01 - Endless Grey.flac \r\n02 - B.flac \r\n03 - Ship.flac \r\n04 - Moments.flac \r\n05 - Tender.flac \r\n06 - Hold.flac \r\n07 - Down.flac \r\n08 - Flood.flac \r\n09 - The Desolate Hour.flac \r\n10 - Rainy Days.flac \r\n11 - Closure.flac \r\n\r\nSummary: \r\nCountry: USA \r\nGenre: dream-pop \r\n\r\n\r\nMedia Report: \r\nSource                           : CD \r\nFormat                           : FLAC \r\nFormat/Info                      : Free Lossless Audio Codec, 16-bit PCM \r\nBit rate mode                    : Variable \r\nBit rate                         : ~ 545-904 Kbps \r\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels \r\nSampling rate                    : 44.1 KHz \r\nBit depth                        : 16 bits","last_updated":"2018-03-19T12:01:06.634Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:a85ad7f306b49233bec0bfd154e5fdc1961045f3","dn":" [dream-pop] (2017) A Thousand Hours - Endless Grey [FLAC,Tracks","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"a85ad7f306b49233bec0bfd154e5fdc1961045f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,90,215,243,6,180,146,51,190,192,191,209,84,229,253,193,150,16,69,243]},"name":" [dream-pop] (2017) A Thousand Hours - Endless Grey [FLAC,Tracks","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
