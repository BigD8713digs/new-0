Hence, they began Wander to satisfy this lust for the drone. Perhaps it took a bit of separation from the production of holy minimalism, but whatever the cause, Wander has fabricated a series of drones, ambience, and atmospheric vibrations that easily surpass that which Beequeen produced many moons ago. Using a whole bunch of analogue synthesizers and an old chord organ, de Waard and Kinkelaar conjure a shimmering tranquilizer references the academic drones of Eliane Radigue and Charlemagne Palestine but also has plenty of impressionist movements that would make fans of Mirror, Troum, and Jonathan Coleclough happy. Limited to 600 copies. - aquariusrecords.org","last_updated":"2017-05-27T08:50:20.522Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:d85340e8a945b0c466a7f03d4b5dfb0451516273","dn":"Wander 2005 Wander","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"d85340e8a945b0c466a7f03d4b5dfb0451516273","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,83,64,232,169,69,176,196,102,167,240,61,75,93,251,4,81,81,98,115]},"name":"Wander 2005 Wander","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
