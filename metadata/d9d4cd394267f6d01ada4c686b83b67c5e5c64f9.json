The story has been the subject of websites, short stories, collections of true crime, novels, a graphic novel, and the FX television series American Horror Story. But the real story of the Axeman of New Orleans has never been written - until now.\r\n\r\nThe Axeman repeatedly broke into the homes of Italian grocers in the dead of night, leaving his victims in a pool of blood. Iorlando Jordano, an innocent Italian grocer, and his teenage son Frank were wrongly accused of one of those murders; corrupt officials convicted them with coerced testimony. Miriam C. Davis here expertly tells the story of the search for the Axeman and of the eventual exoneration of the innocent Jordanos. She proves that the person mostly widely suspected of being the Axeman was not the killer. She also shows what few have suspected - that the Axeman continued killing after leaving New Orleans in 1919.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-07-11T12:00:21.121Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9d4cd394267f6d01ada4c686b83b67c5e5c64f9","dn":"Miriam Davis - The Axeman of New Orleans 2017 RETAiL ePUB eBOOK-","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"d9d4cd394267f6d01ada4c686b83b67c5e5c64f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,212,205,57,66,103,246,208,26,218,76,104,107,131,182,124,94,92,100,249]},"name":"Miriam Davis - The Axeman of New Orleans 2017 RETAiL ePUB eBOOK-","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
