Just scanned it recently. Will be of inerest to people who fancy music of the 80&apos;s. Like most standard music magazines, it contains news 7 reviews of the bands &amp; music of that current era. Remember that it was the era of cassettes &amp; LPs. CDs were a new thing then!\r\nYou will find bands like Roxette, the Beatmasters, Kylie, Bros, etc. There is also a COUNTDOWN POP-POLL for 1989. Happenong TV series, movies &amp; videos are also reviewed in addition to albums, While scanning, I have skipped the irrelevant ads.
