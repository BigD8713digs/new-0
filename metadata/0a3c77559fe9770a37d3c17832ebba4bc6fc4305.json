Yet it isn&apos;t every day you hear from the scientists themselves! Now, award-winning author Jim Al-Khalili and his team of top-notch experts explain how today&apos;s earthshaking discoveries will shape our world tomorrow - and beyond.\r\n\r\nPull back the curtain on genomics, robotics, AI, the Internet of Things, synthetic biology, transhumanism, interstellar travel, colonization of the solar system, teleportation, and much more.\r\n\r\nAnd find insight into big-picture questions such as: \r\n\r\nWill we find a cure to all diseases? \r\nThe answer to climate change? \r\nAnd will bionics one day turn us into superheroes?\r\n\r\nThese scientists are interested only in the truth - reality-based and speculation-free. The future they conjure is by turns tantalizing and sobering: There&apos;s plenty to look forward to, but also plenty to dread. And undoubtedly the best way to for us to face tomorrow&apos;s greatest challenges is to learn what the future looks like - today.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-04-18T15:07:12.909Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a3c77559fe9770a37d3c17832ebba4bc6fc4305","dn":"What the Future Looks Like by Jim Al-Khalili MOBI","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"0a3c77559fe9770a37d3c17832ebba4bc6fc4305","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,60,119,85,159,233,119,10,55,211,193,120,50,235,186,75,198,252,67,5]},"name":"What the Future Looks Like by Jim Al-Khalili MOBI","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
