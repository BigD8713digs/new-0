The book also discusses prolonged production methods for enhanced oil recovery. The monitoring of storage zones for carbon capture are also included, all helping the petroleum and reservoir engineer to fully extend the life of a field and locate untapped pockets of additional oil and gas resources. Rounded out with case studies from locations such as Japan, Saudi Arabia, and Canada, this book will help readers, scientists, and engineers alike to better manage the life of their oil and gas resources and reservoirs.\r\n\r\nBenefits both geoscientists and reservoir engineers to optimize complex reservoirs such as shale and heavy oil\r\nExplains a more accurate and cost efficient reservoir monitoring technology called ACROSS (Accurately Controlled and Routinely Operated Signal System)\r\nIllustrates real-world application through multiple case studies from around the world","last_updated":"2017-06-11T12:04:52.443Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9abd0c2e764fa65545b07a79cb2bb58aa3f230a","dn":"Time Lapse Approach to Monitoring Oil, Gas, and CO2 Storage by S","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"d9abd0c2e764fa65545b07a79cb2bb58aa3f230a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,171,208,194,231,100,250,101,84,91,7,167,156,178,187,88,170,63,35,10]},"name":"Time Lapse Approach to Monitoring Oil, Gas, and CO2 Storage by S","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
