You no longer have to fantasize about being a \r\ngoat, your dreams have finally come true! WASD to \r\nwrite history \r\n\r\nGameplay-wise, Goat Simulator is all about causing \r\nas much destruction as you possibly can as a goat \r\nIt has been compared to an old-school skating game \r\nexcept instead of being a skater, you&apos;re a goat \r\nand instead of doing tricks, you wreck stuff \r\nDestroy things with style, such as doing a backflip \r\nwhile headbutting a bucket through a window, and \r\nyou&apos;ll earn even more points! Or you could just \r\ngive Steam Workshop a spin and create your own \r\ngoats, levels, missions, and more! When it comes to \r\ngoats, not even the sky is the limit, as you can \r\nprobably just bug through it and crash the game \r\n\r\nThe official GOATY Edition includes: \r\n\r\n* Goat Simulator (main game) \r\n* GoatZ DLC \r\n* MMO Simulator DLC \r\n* PAYDAY DLC \r\n* Waste of Space DLC \r\n* Original Soundtrack \r\n\r\n1- Unpack, burn or mount \r\n2- Install the game \r\n3- Copy the cracked content from PROPHET dir \r\n4- Go To Hell! \r\n\r\nNOTE: \r\nThe game is updated to v1.5.58533 \r\nLanguage can be changed in Options menu","last_updated":"2017-07-02T12:00:32.438Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:422c6ff2fb9f71fe1719d5b63a962864e6818db1","dn":"Goat.Simulator.GOATY.Edition-PROPHET","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"422c6ff2fb9f71fe1719d5b63a962864e6818db1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,44,111,242,251,159,113,254,23,25,213,182,58,150,40,100,230,129,141,177]},"name":"Goat.Simulator.GOATY.Edition-PROPHET","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
