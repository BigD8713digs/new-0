She recorded and toured with them for several years.\r\n\r\nIn 1995, she replaced the original fiddler in the Riverdance Irish dance troupe and toured with them.\r\n\r\nHer original blue Barcus-Berry electric fiddle was eye-catching and inspired the name of her album Wild Blue. She later replaced it with a blue ZETA Strados acoustic-electric fiddle, which is a one-of-a-kind instrument with unique sound and ambience. It was custom-made for her by ZETA Music Systems (who will be producing an &quot;Eileen Ivers Signature Series&quot; Blue electric violin exactly like hers).\r\n\r\nIvers has recorded with Miche&#xE1;l &#xD3; S&#xFA;illeabh&#xE1;in, an Irish composer who uses folk, classical and jazz influences, on the television series River of Sound and on his album Becoming (1998).\r\n\r\nShe also recorded a traditional air for the soundtrack to the film Gangs of New York, entitled &quot;Lament for Stalker Wallace&quot;. She appears on the soundtrack for the film Some Mother&apos;s Son","last_updated":"2017-05-06T18:11:03.790Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:5225f477cbb166f73e07b2f8f6463cb70ccc95ba","dn":"Eileen Ivers-Traditional Irish Music (Riverdance fiddle player)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"5225f477cbb166f73e07b2f8f6463cb70ccc95ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,37,244,119,203,177,102,247,62,7,178,248,246,70,60,183,12,204,149,186]},"name":"Eileen Ivers-Traditional Irish Music (Riverdance fiddle player)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
