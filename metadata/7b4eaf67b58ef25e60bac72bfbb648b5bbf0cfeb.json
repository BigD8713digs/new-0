Maneri&#x2019;s long-running partnership with expat Transylvanian pianist Lucian Ban forms two-thirds of this free jazz and improv dream team, the third member being British saxophone one-off Evan Parker. Minimal soprano-sax motifs twist and thicken against Maneri&#x2019;s sinewy slithers and hard-plucked twangs and Ban&#x2019;s damped, wide-spaced chords; dissonant viola drones embrace gentle tenor saxophone purrs that become light, squirming and balletic. This! is fast and jazzy, recalling Parker&#x2019;s robust dialogues with the late Stan Tracey, the Ban-Maneri duet Sounding is expressively sombre and misty, Hymn (a lilting theme for the tenor) is the closest thing to an orthodox song. The fascinating creative tension between the trio&#x2019;s differing views of composition/improv dialectics gives this set an unusually broad appeal &#x2013; to devotees of contemporary classical music, ambient trippers, jazzers and sharp-end improv admirers alike. - John Fordham, The Guardian","last_updated":"2017-06-11T12:01:52.506Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b4eaf67b58ef25e60bac72bfbb648b5bbf0cfeb","dn":"Mat Maneri, Evan Parker, Lucian Ban 2017 Sounding Tears","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"7b4eaf67b58ef25e60bac72bfbb648b5bbf0cfeb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,78,175,103,181,142,242,94,96,186,199,43,251,182,72,181,187,240,207,235]},"name":"Mat Maneri, Evan Parker, Lucian Ban 2017 Sounding Tears","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
