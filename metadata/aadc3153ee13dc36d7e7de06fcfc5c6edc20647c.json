The content is based directly on last semester of my in-person coding bootcamps, where my students go on to land 6-figure developer jobs. I cover the exact same computer science content that has helped my students ace interviews at huge companies like Google, Tesla, Amazon, andNothing is watered down for an online audience; this is the real deal. We start with the basics and then eventually cover &#x201C;advanced topics&#x201D; that similar courses shy away from like Heaps, Graphs, and Dijkstra&#x2019;s Shortest Path Algorithm.\r\nI start by teaching you how to analyze your code&#x2019;s time and space complexity using Big O notation.  We cover the ins and outs of Recursion.  We learn a 5-step approach to solving any difficult coding problem. We cover common programming patterns. We implement popular searching algorithms. We write 6 different sorting algorithms: Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Quick, Merge, and Radix Sort.   Then, we switch gears and implement our own data structures from scratch, including linked lists, trees, heaps, hash tables, and graphs.  We learn to traverse trees and graphs, and cover Dijkstra&#x2019;s Shortest Path Algorithm.\r\n\r\nWho is the target audience?\r\n    Anyone preparing for programming interviews\r\n    Anyone interested in improving their problem solving skills\r\n    Anyone looking to become a better developer!\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n    Basic knowledge of JavaScript syntax\r\n    NO experience with data structures or computer science needed!\r\n\r\nLast updated 8/2018","last_updated":"2018-09-09T12:16:48.127Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:aadc3153ee13dc36d7e7de06fcfc5c6edc20647c","dn":"Udemy - JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Masterclass","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"aadc3153ee13dc36d7e7de06fcfc5c6edc20647c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,220,49,83,238,19,220,54,215,231,222,6,252,252,92,110,220,32,100,124]},"name":"Udemy - JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Masterclass","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
