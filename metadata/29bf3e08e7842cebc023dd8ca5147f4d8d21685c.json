It is the profoundly moving and poetic memoir by Marceline Loridan-Ivens, who, at the age of 15, was arrested in occupied France along with her father. Later, in the camps, he managed to smuggle a note to her, a sign of life that made all the difference to Marceline - but he died in the Holocaust while Marceline survived.\r\n\r\nIn But You Did Not Come Back, Marceline writes back to her father, the man whose death overshadowed her whole life. Although her grief never diminished in its intensity, Marceline ultimately found her calling working as both an activist and a documentary filmmaker. But now, as France and Europe in general face growing anti-Semitism, Marceline feels pessimistic about the future. Her testimony is a memorial, a confrontation, and a deeply affecting personal story of a woman whose life was shattered and never totally rebuilt.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-08-17T12:03:07.802Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:29bf3e08e7842cebc023dd8ca5147f4d8d21685c","dn":"But You Did Not Come Back_ A Memoir by Marceline Loridan-Ivens e","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"29bf3e08e7842cebc023dd8ca5147f4d8d21685c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,191,62,8,231,132,44,235,192,35,221,140,165,20,127,77,141,33,104,92]},"name":"But You Did Not Come Back_ A Memoir by Marceline Loridan-Ivens e","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
