To many, continued progress seems certain. But pot was on a similar trajectory 40 years ago, only to encounter a fierce backlash. In Grass Roots, historian Emily Dufton tells the remarkable story of marijuana&apos;s crooked path from acceptance to demonization and back again and of the thousands of grassroots activists who made changing marijuana laws their life&apos;s work.\r\n\r\nDuring the 1970s, pro-pot campaigners with roots in the counterculture secured the drug&apos;s decriminalization in a dozen states. Soon, though, concerned parents began to mobilize; finding a champion in Nancy Reagan, they transformed pot into a national scourge and helped to pave the way for an aggressive war on drugs. Chastened marijuana advocates retooled their message, promoting pot as a medical necessity and eventually declaring legalization a matter of racial justice. For the moment, these activists are succeeding - but marijuana&apos;s history suggests how swiftly another counterrevolution could unfold.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-12-10T12:00:59.735Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:63a7e4d92663026ded1297ad9726d997e82dc1af","dn":"Grass Roots_ The Rise and Fall and Rise of Marijuana EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"63a7e4d92663026ded1297ad9726d997e82dc1af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,167,228,217,38,99,2,109,237,18,151,173,151,38,217,151,232,45,193,175]},"name":"Grass Roots_ The Rise and Fall and Rise of Marijuana EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
