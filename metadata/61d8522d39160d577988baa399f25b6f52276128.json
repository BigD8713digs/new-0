She knows she&#x2019;s spent her whole life in the small beachside town of Belle Isle; she knows she&#x2019;s never wanted anything more than to live a quiet life as a pillar of the community; she knows she&#x2019;s never kept a secret in her life. Because we all know our mothers, don&#x2019;t we?\r\n\r\nBut all that changes when a trip to the mall explodes into violence and Andrea suddenly sees a completely different side to Laura. Because it turns out that before Laura was Laura, she was someone completely different. For nearly thirty years she&#x2019;s been hiding from her previous identity, lying low in the hope that no one would ever find her. But now she&#x2019;s been exposed, and nothing will ever be the same again.\r\n\r\nThe police want answers and Laura&#x2019;s innocence is on the line, but she won&#x2019;t speak to anyone, including her own daughter. Andrea is on a desperate journey following the breadcrumb trail of her mother&#x2019;s past. And if she can&#x2019;t uncover the secrets hidden there, there may be no future for either one of them...\r\n\r\n\r\nNarrated By: Kathleen Early\r\n\r\nDuration: 16:08:10\r\n\r\nFormat: Stereo mp3\r\n\r\nBit Rate: 64Kbps/44.1Hz","last_updated":"2018-09-13T12:21:28.144Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:61d8522d39160d577988baa399f25b6f52276128","dn":"Pieces of Her - Karin Slaughter","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"61d8522d39160d577988baa399f25b6f52276128","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,216,82,45,57,22,13,87,121,136,186,163,153,242,91,111,82,39,97,40]},"name":"Pieces of Her - Karin Slaughter","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
