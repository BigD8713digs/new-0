Foege\r\n\r\nRequirements: .ePUB reader\r\n\r\nOverview: In its seventy years, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has evolved from a malaria control program to an institution dedicated to improving health for all people across the world. The Fears of the Rich, The Needs of the Poor is a revealing account of the CDC&#x2019;s development by its former director, public health luminary William H. Foege. \r\n\r\nDr. Foege tells the stories of pivotal moments in public health, including the eradication of smallpox (made possible due in part to Foege&#x2019;s research) and the discovery of Legionnaires&#x2019; disease, Reye syndrome, toxic shock syndrome, and HIV/AIDS. With good humor and optimism, he recounts the various crises he surmounted, from threats of terrorist attacks to contentious congressional hearings and funding cuts. Highlighting the people who made possible some of public health&#x2019;s biggest successes, Foege outlines the work required behind the scenes and describes the occasional tensions between professionals in the field and the politicians in charge of oversight.\r\n\r\nGenre: Non-Fiction &gt; Health, Fitness &amp; Medical","last_updated":"2018-09-19T12:22:40.474Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:be5dcddf07ff64d0addb7aaa637ae76ead42ee5c","dn":"The Fears of the Rich..by William H.
