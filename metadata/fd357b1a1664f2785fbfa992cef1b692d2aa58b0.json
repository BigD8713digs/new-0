The &quot;Rodrigo&apos;s Concerto&quot; is brilliant! That lone trumpet with the brass behind it is the most wonderful &quot;En Aranjuez Con Tu Amor&quot; I&apos;ve ever heard. Usually it is performed on guitar. This was an experience. I liked the rest of the recording, but, the &quot;Orange Juice&quot; as they said in the movie (ha, ha) was beyond description. \r\n\r\nreally like the movie, &quot;Brassed Off&quot;. I also really enjoy brass band music. One piece from the movie, &quot;En Aranjuez Con Tu Amor&quot;, was impossible to find in that particular arrangement...Even the great Miles Davis album, &quot;Sketches From Spain&quot;, didn&apos;t quite compare. \r\nOnce again, Amazon came through with just what I wanted, and at a reasonable price. The only thing missing from the soundtrack was the late Pete Postlewaite&apos;s impassioned speeches...They are memorable.
