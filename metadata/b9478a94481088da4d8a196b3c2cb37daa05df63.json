One is the great-granddaughter of a king&apos;s mistress and a celebrated homewrecker who survived a firestorm of scorn to marry her lover and replace her archrival, a beloved 20th-century figure. One is a beautiful commoner, the university-educated daughter of a self-made entrepreneur, a fashion idol, and wife and mother to two future kings.\r\n\r\nMaster biographer Christopher Andersen takes readers behind palace walls to examine the surprising similarities and stark differences among three remarkable women - Queen Elizabeth; Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall; and Princess Kate. Andersen reveals what transpires within the royal family away from the public&apos;s prying eyes; how the women actually feel about each other; how they differ as lovers, wives, and mothers; and how they are reshaping the landscape of the monarchy in this addictive read that will shock even those who are spellbound by the royal palace.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-01-27T12:04:50.562Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9478a94481088da4d8a196b3c2cb37daa05df63","dn":"Game of Crowns by Christopher Andersen MOBI","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"b9478a94481088da4d8a196b3c2cb37daa05df63","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,71,138,148,72,16,136,218,77,138,25,107,60,44,179,125,170,5,223,99]},"name":"Game of Crowns by Christopher Andersen MOBI","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
