Ferdinand Addis brings the myth of Rome alive by concentrating on vivid episodes from its long and unimaginably rich history. Each of his beautifully composed chapters is an evocative, self-contained narrative, whether it is the murder of Caesar; the near-destruction of the city by the Gauls in 387 BC; the construction of the Colosseum and the fate of the gladiators; Bernini&apos;s creation of the Baroque masterpiece that is St Peter&apos;s Basilica; the brutal crushing of republican dreams in 1849; the sinister degeneration of Mussolini&apos;s first state, or the magical, corrupt Rome of Fellini&apos;s La Dolce Vita.\r\n\r\nThis is an epic, kaleidoscopic history of a city indelibly associated with republicanism and dictatorship, Christian orthodoxy and its rivals, high art and low life in all its forms","last_updated":"2018-09-08T12:24:41.670Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:385532251798b2402ea138ef820953779ebe83ed","dn":"Rome: Eternal City by Ferdinand Addis (.epub)(.azw3)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"385532251798b2402ea138ef820953779ebe83ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,85,50,37,23,152,178,64,46,161,56,239,130,9,83,119,158,190,131,237]},"name":"Rome: Eternal City by Ferdinand Addis (.epub)(.azw3)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
