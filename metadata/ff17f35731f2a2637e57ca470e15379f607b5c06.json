But for a Courtney, the greatest danger might just be his own family.... Francis Courtney flees the comfort of his Devonshire estate when his stepfather&apos;s gambling debts leave him penniless and at risk. He sails to South Africa with revenge and fortune on his mind: his uncle Tom Courtney killed his father, and Francis intends to avenge his death and make his fortune in the process. However, upon his arrival in Cape Town, he uncovers a truth that leaves him overwhelmed and disoriented. Christopher Courtney sets out to make his own way in the world, giving up his privileged position as the son of the Governor of Bombay. The perils and betrayals on his journey carve a fierce warrior out of him, but they also harden his soul and lead him to greater violence and treachery. As the lives of these two Courtney men intertwine, the sins of the fathers will forever alter the lives of a younger generation. The Tiger&apos;s Prey takes listeners on an epic journey from the southernmost point of Africa, through the perilous waters of the Arabian Sea, to the lush Indian coastline. It is an incredible and breathless tale of intrigue and family betrayal from one of the world&apos;s greatest storytellers","last_updated":"2017-09-11T12:09:00.106Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff17f35731f2a2637e57ca470e15379f607b5c06","dn":"Wilbur Smith - The Tiger's Prey By - Buddy n Rizz","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"ff17f35731f2a2637e57ca470e15379f607b5c06","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,23,243,87,49,242,162,99,126,87,202,71,14,21,55,159,96,123,92,6]},"name":"Wilbur Smith - The Tiger's Prey By - Buddy n Rizz","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
