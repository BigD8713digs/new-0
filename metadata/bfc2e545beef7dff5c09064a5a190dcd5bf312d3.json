The explanations of transcendent phenomena given by saints, sages, and near-death experiencers are fully congruent with scientific discoveries in the fields of relativity, quantum physics, medicine, M-theory, neuroscience, and quantum biology.\r\n\r\nThe Physics of God describes the intersections of science and religion with colorful, easy-to-understand metaphors, making abstruse subjects within both science and religion easily accessible to the layman-no math, no dogma. This intriguing book:\r\n\r\nPulls back the curtain on the light-show illusion we call matter.\r\n\r\nReveals the scientific secret of life and immortality: quantum biology&apos;s startling discovery that the human body is continuously entangled.\r\n\r\nDemonstrates the miracle-making power of our minds to effect instantaneous physiological changes.\r\n\r\nExplains how the intelligent observer effect confirms our high spiritual potential.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-06-05T12:01:16.829Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:bfc2e545beef7dff5c09064a5a190dcd5bf312d3","dn":"The Physics of God by Amit Goswami, Joseph Selbie EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"bfc2e545beef7dff5c09064a5a190dcd5bf312d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,194,229,69,190,239,125,255,92,9,6,74,90,25,13,205,91,243,18,211]},"name":"The Physics of God by Amit Goswami, Joseph Selbie EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
