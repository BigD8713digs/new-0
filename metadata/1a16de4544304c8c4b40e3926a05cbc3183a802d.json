This approach starts with the fundamental building block of matter, the atom, and uses it as the stepping stone to understanding more complex chemistry topics. Once mastery of the nature of atoms and electrons is achieved, the formation and properties of compounds are developed. Only after the study of matter and the atom will students have sufficient background to fully engage in topics such as stoichiometry, kinetics, equilibrium, and thermodynamics. Thus, the Atoms First approach empowers instructors to present the most complete and compelling story of general chemistry. \r\n\r\nFar from a simple re-ordering of topics, this is a book that will truly meet the needs of the growing atoms-first market. The third edition continues to build on the innovative success of the first and second editions. Changes to this edition include specific refinements intended to augment the student-centered pedagogical features that continue to make this book effective and popular both with professors, and with their students","last_updated":"2017-06-15T12:00:25.903Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a16de4544304c8c4b40e3926a05cbc3183a802d","dn":"Chemistry - Atoms First (WCB Chemistry) - 3E (2017) Gooner","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"1a16de4544304c8c4b40e3926a05cbc3183a802d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,22,222,69,68,48,76,140,75,64,227,146,106,5,203,195,24,58,128,45]},"name":"Chemistry - Atoms First (WCB Chemistry) - 3E (2017) Gooner","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
