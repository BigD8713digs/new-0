Generally, electronics design engineers and manufacturing engineers are not well versed in adhesives, while adhesion chemists have a limited knowledge of electronics. This book bridges these knowledge gaps and is useful to both groups.\r\n\r\nThe book includes chapters covering types of adhesive, the chemistry on which they are based, and their properties, applications, processes, specifications, and reliability. Coverage of toxicity, environmental impacts and the regulatory framework make this book particularly important for engineers and managers alike","last_updated":"2017-06-16T12:04:30.759Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:6024bcc5eb278ebf3b7d09bfa2c62cd6518276ed","dn":"Adhesives Technology for Electronic Applications","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"6024bcc5eb278ebf3b7d09bfa2c62cd6518276ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,36,188,197,235,39,142,191,59,125,9,191,162,198,44,214,81,130,118,237]},"name":"Adhesives Technology for Electronic Applications","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
