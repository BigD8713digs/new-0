The slower\r\nyour cpu, the more noticeable the lags are on these two.\r\nEven though the game isnt exactly new anymore, there are still a\r\nlot of bugs left in the legit version.\r\n\r\nSome Denuvo Techtalk :\r\n\r\nFor example when Robin does one of his special attacks, throwing a\r\nsmoke bomb on the ground, Denuvo starts writing a private key to the\r\nmemory from 000000014C113692:\r\n\r\n000000014C113692   44 88 07                   mov byte ptr ds:[rdi],r8b\r\n000000014C113695   5F                         pop rdi\r\n000000014C113696   50                         push rax\r\n000000014C113697   21 C0                      and eax,eax\r\n000000014C113699   9C                         pushfq\r\n000000014C11369A   44 01 C1                   add ecx,r8d\r\n000000014C11369D   4C 89 F0                   mov rax,r14\r\n000000014C1136A0   48 89 C1                   mov rcx,rax\r\n000000014C1136A3   48 C7 C0 00 00 00 00       mov rax,0\r\n000000014C1136AA   48 09 D0                   or rax,rdx\r\n000000014C1136AD   48 83 C1 01                add rcx,1\r\n000000014C1136B1   49 89 CE                   mov r14,rcx\r\n000000014C1136B4   C1 C1 08                   rol ecx,8\r\n000000014C1136B7   9D                         popfq","last_updated":"2018-10-26T12:31:51.671Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0ab0ba248eba03e55db63cb8e5c90ca1d7a278e","dn":"Injustice.2.Legendary.Edition-CODEX","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"c0ab0ba248eba03e55db63cb8e5c90ca1d7a278e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,171,11,162,72,235,160,62,85,219,99,203,142,92,144,202,29,122,39,142]},"name":"Injustice.2.Legendary.Edition-CODEX","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
