Walt\r\n\r\nRequirements: .ePUB reader\r\n\r\nOverview: From the New York Times&#x2013;bestselling author Stephen M. Walt, The Hell of Good Intentions dissects the faults and foibles of recent American foreign policy&#x2014;explaining why it has been plagued by disasters like the &quot;forever wars&quot; in Iraq and Afghanistan and outlining what can be done to fix it.\r\nIn 1992, the United States stood at the pinnacle of world power and Americans were confident that a new era of peace and prosperity was at hand. Twenty-five years later, those hopes have been dashed. Relations with Russia and China have soured, the European Union is wobbling, nationalism and populism are on the rise, and the United States is stuck in costly and pointless wars that have squandered trillions of dollars and undermined its influence around the world.\r\n\r\nGenre: Non-fiction &gt; Educational","last_updated":"2018-10-17T12:32:00.690Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:df4aab819243e1daab1752bf4e77769574ad80bf","dn":"The Hell of Good Intentions by Stephen M.
