The school that produced three perfect seasons in a row, with five once-in-a generation players, called &quot;The Generation of Miracles.&quot; There was another player who all of them respected... A legendary 6th player. An up-and-coming power player, Taiga Kagami, is just back from America. When he comes to Seirin High School, he meets the super-ordinary boy, Tetsuya Kuroko. Kagami is shocked to find that Kuroko isn&apos;t good at basketball, in fact, he&apos;s bad! And he&apos;s so plain that he&apos;s impossible to see. But Kuroko&apos;s plainness lets him pass the ball around without the other team noticing him, and he&apos;s none other than the sixth member of the Miracle Generation. Kuroko makes a pact with Kagami to defeat the other members of the Miracle Generation, who have all played basketball at other schools. A battle of light (Kagami) and shadow (Kuroko) begins! \r\n\r\nInfo:\r\nAudio: Jap\r\nSubs: Eng\r\nEps: 25\r\nEncoder: Frozen_Solid [F-D]\r\nSize/ep: 80MB +/-\r\nFormat: .mkv","last_updated":"2017-06-18T12:01:24.364Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0a58908b9b8ebd51ea275966d2e4216e859ccfa","dn":"[F-D] Kuroko's Basketball [480P][Subbed]","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"b0a58908b9b8ebd51ea275966d2e4216e859ccfa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,165,137,8,185,184,235,213,30,162,117,150,109,46,66,22,232,89,204,250]},"name":"[F-D] Kuroko's Basketball [480P][Subbed]","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
