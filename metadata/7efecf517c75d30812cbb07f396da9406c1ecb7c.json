But customers can be fickle, markets shift, and competitors are ruthless. So how do you ensure a steady flow of repeat business? The secret--no matter what industry you&apos;re in--is finding and keeping automatic customers. These days virtually anything you need can be purchased through a subscription, with more convenience than ever before. Far beyond Spotify, Netflix, and New York Times subscriptions, you can sign up for weekly or monthly supplies of everything from groceries (AmazonFresh) to cosmetics (Birchbox) to razor blades (Dollar Shave Club).\r\n\r\nAccording to John Warrillow, this emerging subscription economy offers huge opportunities to companies that know how to turn customers into subscribers. Automatic customers are the key to increasing cash flow, igniting growth, and boosting the value of your company.\r\n\r\nWhether you want to transform your entire business into a recurring revenue engine or just pick up an extra 5 percent of sales growth, The Automatic Customer will be your secret weapon.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-06-17T12:02:51.472Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:7efecf517c75d30812cbb07f396da9406c1ecb7c","dn":"The Automatic Customer by John Warrillow AZW","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"7efecf517c75d30812cbb07f396da9406c1ecb7c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,254,207,81,124,117,211,8,18,203,176,127,57,109,169,64,108,30,203,124]},"name":"The Automatic Customer by John Warrillow AZW","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
