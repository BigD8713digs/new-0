D. Brady AZW3\r\n\r\nAn innocent discovery on a Montana ranch two years ago, sets off a series of events that may very well change the world . . . if it doesn&apos;t end it first.\r\n\r\nProfessor Delaney McPhearson&apos;s life is turned upside down when her best friend, archaeologist Drew Masters, is found dead. Before she can deal with the heartbreaking loss, she is viciously attacked in her home by a man with inhuman fighting abilities. Former Navy SEAL and head of security for a global think tank, Jake Rogan drops everything when he hears his foster brother Tom Jeffries has gone missing. There seem to be no clues, no information about his whereabouts. He has just vanished. But Jake won&apos;t rest until he finds him.\r\n\r\nLaney and Jake join forces when they learn that the fates of their loved ones are intertwined. And somehow all the danger that dogs their steps, revolves around an eccentric archaeologist&apos;s controversial work on Gobekli Tepe, and the search for an ancient source of power. Their personal quest soon becomes a race to protect humanity&apos;s very existence. But how can they defeat a foe who has been planning his moves for millennia? To save mankind, Laney and Jake know they must succeed. But to succeed, they must live long enough to fight.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-06-13T12:06:21.519Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:3475c4e8f9efaa8b58e387fb928d60d9bce0f06e","dn":"The Belial Stone by R.
