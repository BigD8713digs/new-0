Always on the look-out\r\n\r\n\r\nfor new female company to helpcarry on the Beesley name, the Landlord keeps a\r\n\r\n watchful eye over Grockleton and anyone who dares to enter his land. When three\r\n\r\n improbable heroes stumble unsuspectingly into the Beesley&apos;s realm they are cruelly\r\n\r\n snared into a menacing hunt and an unstoppable frenzy of heart racing mayhem! Will\r\n\r\n the  Landlord triumph and collect his &apos;trophies&apos; (and maybe even a future bride?),\r\n\r\n or can the unlikely trio be victorious against him in his own game?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n www.imdb.com/title/tt0478265/","last_updated":"2017-06-19T12:05:53.874Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d0116e86e703d492fe8d8f3ae4e28ea9b3fd881","dn":"Small Town Folk [2007]","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"2d0116e86e703d492fe8d8f3ae4e28ea9b3fd881","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,1,22,232,110,112,61,73,47,232,216,243,174,78,40,234,155,63,216,129]},"name":"Small Town Folk [2007]","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
