After the death of her parents, she is apprenticed to an eccentric wax sculptor and whisked off to the seamy streets of Paris, where they meet a domineering widow and her quiet, pale son. Together, they convert an abandoned monkey house into an exhibition hall for wax heads, and the spectacle becomes a sensation. \r\n\r\nAs word of her artistic talent spreads, Marie is called to Versailles, where she tutors a princess and saves Marie Antoinette in childbirth. But outside the palace walls, Paris is roiling: The revolutionary mob is demanding heads, and...at the wax museum, heads are what they do.\r\n\r\nIn the tradition of Gregory Maguire&apos;s Wicked and Erin Morgenstern&apos;s The Night Circus, Edward Carey&apos;s Little is a darkly endearing cavalcade of a novel - a story of art, class, determination, and how we hold on to what we love.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-10-26T12:11:08.860Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab3208c39a6d2887b3ff7345a61ec405f03ae9cd","dn":"Little: A Novel by Edward Carey EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"ab3208c39a6d2887b3ff7345a61ec405f03ae9cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,50,8,195,154,109,40,135,179,255,115,69,166,30,196,5,240,58,233,205]},"name":"Little: A Novel by Edward Carey EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
