Now diffused among endusers devices in mobile and wireline networks, the cloud is becoming the &quot;fog&quot;. This book presents frameworks and schemes that use devices from end-users or near-users to carry out storage, communication, computation and control in the network. These novel approaches support the Internet of Things, the efficient provision of heterogeneous 5G mobile services, as well as emerging applications over future wireless network architectures.\r\nElaborating on the emerging mobile networking paradigms for the 2020 5G timeframe, this book presents new connectivity services that are highly scalable and programmable in terms of speed, capacity, security, reliability, availability, latency and impact on battery life. Finally, the book discusses recent and new developments, prompting future directions on the theories, practices, standards and strategies related to 5G mobile systems. Topics covered include: network storage, Internet of Things (IoT); heterogeneous 5G mobile services; 5G green mobile networks; cloudlet-based architectures in mobile cloud computing environments; software-defined networking (SDN) and network functions virtualization (NFV); FOG-enabled navigation system; FIWARE and IoT technologies; real time video distribution; hybrid resource sharing; energy efficiency in cognitive radio networks; edge computing in future 5G mobile networks; and virtual network functions over cloud infrastructures","last_updated":"2017-07-11T12:00:52.132Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:f82d8ad130bc04c8e3cbb75affc97486aa1698be","dn":"Cloud and Fog Computing in 5G Mobile Networks Emerging advances ","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"f82d8ad130bc04c8e3cbb75affc97486aa1698be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,45,138,209,48,188,4,200,227,203,183,90,255,201,116,134,170,22,152,190]},"name":"Cloud and Fog Computing in 5G Mobile Networks Emerging advances ","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
