The highlights include the original medium-tempo blues &quot;Chapulta Walk,&quot; a revival of Thad Jones&apos; &quot;Fingers&quot; (a romp over rhythm changes) with Gisbert being effective on muted trumpet, and tenor saxophonist Chris Potter really cutting loose and eating up the chord changes on Charlie Parker&apos;s &quot;Segment&quot; and Thelonious Monk&apos;s &quot;Played Twice.&quot; All of the musicians play at their expected high levels, with altoist Steve Wilson and pianist John Campbell also having their strong moments. This set is easily recommended to fans of modern straight-ahead jazz. - Scott Yanow, AMG","last_updated":"2017-06-17T12:01:03.995Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d4c530ed267d1a604720811b6d15bd61855ddd7","dn":"Greg Gisbert Sextet 1996 On Second Thought","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"4d4c530ed267d1a604720811b6d15bd61855ddd7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,76,83,14,210,103,209,166,4,114,8,17,182,209,91,214,24,85,221,215]},"name":"Greg Gisbert Sextet 1996 On Second Thought","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
