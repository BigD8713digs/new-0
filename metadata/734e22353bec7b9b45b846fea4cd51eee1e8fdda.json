The books follow the turbulent lives of Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire. After their parents&apos; death in a fire, the children are placed in the custody of a murderous relative, Count Olaf, who attempts to steal their inheritance and, later, orchestrates numerous disasters with the help of his accomplices as the children attempt to flee. As the plot progresses, the Baudelaires gradually confront further mysteries surrounding their family and deep conspiracies involving a secret society known as V.F.D., with connections to both Olaf and their parents. The series is narrated by Snicket, who dedicates each of his works to his deceased love interest, Beatrice, and often attempts to dissuade the reader from continuing to read the Baudelaires&apos; story.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you have problems with the format, download calibre: https://calibre-ebook.com","last_updated":"2017-10-10T12:05:16.371Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:734e22353bec7b9b45b846fea4cd51eee1e8fdda","dn":"A Series of Unfortunate Events Ominibus - Books 1-13","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"734e22353bec7b9b45b846fea4cd51eee1e8fdda","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,78,34,53,59,236,123,155,69,184,70,254,164,205,81,238,225,232,253,218]},"name":"A Series of Unfortunate Events Ominibus - Books 1-13","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
