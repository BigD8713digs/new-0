The alphabetically organized, illustrated biographical dictionary has been thoroughly revised and updated, covering over 1,500 key scientists (157 more than in the previous edition) from 40 countries. Physics, chemistry, biology, geology, astronomy, mathematics, medicine, meteorology and technology are all represented and special attention is paid to pioneer women whose achievements and example opened the way to scientific careers for others. \r\nThis new edition includes recent Nobel laureates, as well as winners of the Fields Medal, the mathematician&apos;s equivalent of the Nobel Prize. Illustrated with around 150 portraits, diagrams, maps and tables, and with special panel features, this book is an accessible guide to the world&apos;s prominent scientific personalities. \r\n\r\nAbout the Authors\r\nDavid Millar has carried out research into the flow of polar ice sheets at the Scott Polar Research Institute, Cambridge, and in Antarctica. He has also written on a range of science and technology topics, and edited a study of the politics of the Antarctic. His professional career has been spent in the oil industry, principally in the marketing of geoscience software. He lives in France. \r\nJohn Millar graduated from Trinity College, Cambridge, and has a doctorate from Imperial College, London. He worked for BP developing new geophysical methods for use in oil exploration and production. In 1994 he co-founded GroundFlow Ltd., which has developed electrokinetic surveying and logging as a new technique for imaging and mapping fluids in subsurface porous rocks.\r\n <a href=\"\nhttps://s12.postimg.org/fa36al5nh/Cambridge_Dictionary_of_Scientists_2nd_Ed.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://s12.postimg.org/fa36al5nh/Cambridge_Dictionary_of_Scientists_2nd_Ed.jpg</a>","last_updated":"2017-05-31T11:09:32.073Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f022e714451a8f03bff34f7339cd97c1a3a520b","dn":"Cambridge Dictionary of Scientists (2nd Ed)(gnv64)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"3f022e714451a8f03bff34f7339cd97c1a3a520b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,2,46,113,68,81,168,240,59,255,52,247,51,156,217,124,26,58,82,11]},"name":"Cambridge Dictionary of Scientists (2nd Ed)(gnv64)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
