Countless hours were spent on the hunt for the elusive orb, and some of the era&#x2019;s most skilled astronomers even claimed to have found it.\r\n\r\nThere was just one problem: It was never there.\r\n\r\nA dramatic human story of an epic quest, The Hunt for Vulcan offers insight into how science really advances (as opposed to the way we&#x2019;re taught about it in school) and how the best work of the greatest scientists reveals an artist&#x2019;s sensibility. Opening a new window onto our world, Levenson illuminates some of our most iconic ideas as he recounts one of the strangest episodes in the history of science.\r\n\r\nAbout the Author\r\nThomas Levenson is a professor at MIT and head of its science writing program. He is the author of several books, including Einstein in Berlin and Newton and the Counterfeiter: The Unknown Detective Career of the World&#x2019;s Greatest Scientist. He has also made ten feature-length documentaries (including a two-hour Nova program on Einstein) for which he has won numerous awards.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\nPREFACE\r\nPART ONE: NEWTON TO NEPTUNE (1682-1846)\r\n1. &quot;THE IMMOVABLE ORDER OF THE WORLD&quot; 3\r\n2. &quot;A HAPPY THOUGHT&quot; 13\r\n3. &quot;THAT STAR IS NOT ON THE MAP&quot; 27\r\nINTERLUDE: &quot;SO VERY OCCULT&quot; 44\r\nPART TWO: NEPTUNE TO VULCAN (1846-1878)\r\n4.
