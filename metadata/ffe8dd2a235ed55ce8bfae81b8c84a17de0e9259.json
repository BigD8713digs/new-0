But while staying at the home of an invalid widow in Florida, Duff makes a discovery that freezes his blood: a cache of uranium hidden in the locked closet of a fellow guest. The FBI is initially skeptical, but Duff knows all too well what his findings portend. Suddenly, not only is his future in jeopardy, but the fate of millions of Americans hangs in the balance as well. If he cannot expose the horrific plot his nation&apos;s enemies set in motion years before, entire cities will be reduced to piles of radioactive rubble in an unthinkable nuclear nightmare stretching from coast to coast. And time, it seems, is rapidly running out.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-06-04T12:14:33.007Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:ffe8dd2a235ed55ce8bfae81b8c84a17de0e9259","dn":"The Smuggled Atom Bomb by Philip Wylie EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"ffe8dd2a235ed55ce8bfae81b8c84a17de0e9259","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,232,221,42,35,94,213,92,232,191,174,129,184,200,74,23,222,14,146,89]},"name":"The Smuggled Atom Bomb by Philip Wylie EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
