This was an era when a broken leg could lead to amputation, and surgeons were still known to ransack cemeteries to find cadavers. And in squalid, overcrowded hospitals, doctors remained baffled by the persistent infections that kept mortality rates stubbornly high.\r\n\r\nAt a time when surgery couldn&apos;t have been more dangerous, an unlikely figure stepped forward: Joseph Lister, a young Quaker surgeon. By making the audacious claim that germs were the source of all infection - and could be treated with antiseptics - he changed the history of medicine forever.\r\n\r\nWith a novelist&apos;s eye for detail, Fitzharris brilliantly conjures up the grisly world of Victorian surgery, revealing how one of Britain&apos;s greatest medical minds finally brought centuries of savagery, sawing and gangrene to an end.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-10-22T12:01:36.844Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:fea7a3de8ab479350535ec826adabeb1113d9e7d","dn":"The Butchering Art by Lindsey Fitzharris EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"fea7a3de8ab479350535ec826adabeb1113d9e7d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,167,163,222,138,180,121,53,5,53,236,130,106,218,190,177,17,61,158,125]},"name":"The Butchering Art by Lindsey Fitzharris EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
