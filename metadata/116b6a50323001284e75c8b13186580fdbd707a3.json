She reluctantly lets her trusted stable assistant join her in a journey across the wilds of Northern California in the hope of catching Silas for one final showdown. The story follows the chase and shares the story of the brothers&apos; rise from hardscrabble childhood to their reign as the region&apos;s preeminent horse trainers, tracking the tense sibling rivalry that ultimately led to the elder&apos;s death. A fully realized tale that challenges notions of the modern West, The Last Cowboys of San Geronimo will satisfy fans of Kent Haruf, Larry McMurtry, Molly Gloss, and Smith Henderson, and it will establish Stansel as a new voice in this grand tradition.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-07-25T12:00:29.929Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:116b6a50323001284e75c8b13186580fdbd707a3","dn":"The Last Cowboys of San Geronimo by Ian Stansel ePUB eBOOK-ZAK","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"116b6a50323001284e75c8b13186580fdbd707a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,107,106,80,50,48,1,40,78,117,200,177,49,134,88,15,219,215,7,163]},"name":"The Last Cowboys of San Geronimo by Ian Stansel ePUB eBOOK-ZAK","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
