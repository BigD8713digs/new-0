Accountants. Software Engineers. That&apos;s what Mom and Dad encouraged us to become. They were wrong. Gone is the age of &quot;left-brain&quot; dominance. The future belongs to a different kind of person with a different kind of mind: designers, inventors, teachers, storytellers - creative and emphatic &quot;right-brain&quot; thinkers whose abilities mark the fault line between who gets ahead and who doesn&apos;t.\r\n\r\nDrawing on research from around the advanced world, Daniel Pink outlines six fundamentally human abilities that are essential for professional success and personal fulfillment - and reveals how to master them.\r\n\r\nFrom a laughter club in Bombay to an inner-city high school devoted to design, to a lesson on how to detect an insincere smile, A Whole New Mind takes readers to a daring new place, and offers a provocative and urgent new way of thinking about a future that has already arrived.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-09-18T12:02:23.730Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d4f58302fb7eb26668fdb3a91a9babd2409502f","dn":"A Whole New Mind_ Why Right-Brainers Will Rule the Future by Dan","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"1d4f58302fb7eb26668fdb3a91a9babd2409502f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,79,88,48,47,183,235,38,102,143,219,58,145,169,186,189,36,9,80,47]},"name":"A Whole New Mind_ Why Right-Brainers Will Rule the Future by Dan","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
