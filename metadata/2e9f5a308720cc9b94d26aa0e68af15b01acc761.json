He said that he wanted Theophilus to know the certainty of the things in which he had been instructed.\r\n\r\nWe are living in a day of great spiritual confusion. When Paul wrote to the Ephesians he spoke of how God had placed pastors and teachers in the church for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, and for the building up of the body of Christ. The purpose was to bring them into spiritual maturity that they would not be carried away with every wind of doctrine and slight cunning of men who lie in wait to deceive. These are days when there are many winds of doctrine blowing through the church. The greatest defense against deception is a solid foundation in the Word.\r\n\r\nThis is what we seek to develop through our studies in the Scriptures. We are dedicated to bringing you the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help us God. This is why we offer to you the studies in the Scriptures at near our costs, as we are wanting to make the Word of God available to all. We want you to build your spiritual house on the rock solid Word of God so that it will be able to withstand the fiercest storms\r\n\r\nMay God bless you as you study the Word.\r\n\r\nIn His love,\r\n\r\nPastor Chuck","last_updated":"2017-11-12T12:05:08.018Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e9f5a308720cc9b94d26aa0e68af15b01acc761","dn":"Chuck Smith - OT and NT - 3000 Series Complete - Part 2","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"2e9f5a308720cc9b94d26aa0e68af15b01acc761","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,159,90,48,135,32,204,155,148,210,106,160,230,138,241,91,1,172,199,97]},"name":"Chuck Smith - OT and NT - 3000 Series Complete - Part 2","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
