He covers the trajectories of the big name acts like Elvis Presley, Buddy Holly, Chuck Berry, and Ray Charles, while also filling in gaps of knowledge and celebrating forgotten heroes such as the Burnette brothers, the &quot;5&quot; Royales, and Marion Keisker, Sam Phillips&apos;s assistant, who played an integral part in launching Elvis&apos;s career.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-10-30T12:02:35.216Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:373f64df3776d7529bc726539f0ef6b916e9b838","dn":"The History of Rock &amp; Roll, Volume 1 by Ed Ward EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"373f64df3776d7529bc726539f0ef6b916e9b838","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,63,100,223,55,118,215,82,155,199,38,83,159,14,246,185,22,233,184,56]},"name":"The History of Rock &amp; Roll, Volume 1 by Ed Ward EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
