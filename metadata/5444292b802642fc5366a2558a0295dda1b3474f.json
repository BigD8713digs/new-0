Her silken voice and outspoken social awareness wooed music fans and cemented her status as one of the day&apos;s most astute and captivating artists. Though 10,000 Maniacs achieved a level of critical success as a major-label act in the mid-80&apos;s, Merchant decided to go it alone in 1994. Since then her popularity has bloomed in the wake of Tigerlily, Ophelia, Motherland, Live in Concert: Natalie Merchant and The House Carpenter&apos;s Daughter. Featured here are the hits in an intimate, one-of-a-kind setting. \r\nEach song (except tracks 1 &amp; 8) is preceded by an introduction by Natalie Merchant. The tracklist and the durations here above don&apos;t take into account those introductions. Total disc duration (including introductions and bonus tracks) is 55mn 06s.
