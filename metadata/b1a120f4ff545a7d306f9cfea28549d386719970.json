It started as a dns-filter. Now it provides web-proxy based filtering as well. NxFilter can do everything you can expect from a dns-filter or a web-filter. \r\n\r\nFaster and lighter \r\nTraditionally we made a web-filter based on HTTP proxy server. There are many commercial products based on Squid proxy. But with this approach you might have a serious latency problem on your network. This is because your web traffic needs to go through one point in your network that is your web-filter and it becomes a bottle neck in your network. This latency problem gets bigger when you have bigger number of users. But there&#x2019;s another approach. That&#x2019;s DNS filtering and NxFilter is a dns-filter. It&#x2019;s basically a forwarding DNS server with filtering ability. Since it uses light weight DNS protocol there&#x2019;s no need to have your traffic going through anywhere. You get no latency problem with NxFilter. \r\n\r\nBoosting up your Internet speed \r\nSome users reported that after they installed NxFilter on their network their Internet speed improved greatly. This is because NxFilter keeps local cache for DNS lookup. Suppose in your network everybody uses Google public DNS server or your ISP DNS server. Their DNS queries need to be sent to these DNS servers on the Internet and your users need to wait for the response back from these servers. But if you have NxFilter in your network it keeps cache for the DNS response from its upstream DNS servers and reduces the network traffic greatly and your users don&#x2019;t need to wait for the response from these DNS servers on the Internet. \r\n\r\nHow to Install: \r\n1). Instructions are included in ReadMe.txt if needed. \r\n2). Thats all, Done &amp; enjoy","last_updated":"2017-08-01T12:01:05.730Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1a120f4ff545a7d306f9cfea28549d386719970","dn":"NxFilter 4.1.5   license - Crackingpatching","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"b1a120f4ff545a7d306f9cfea28549d386719970","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,161,32,244,255,84,90,125,48,111,156,254,162,133,73,211,134,113,153,112]},"name":"NxFilter 4.1.5   license - Crackingpatching","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
