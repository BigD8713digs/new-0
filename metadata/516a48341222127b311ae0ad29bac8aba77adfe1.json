The story is told in a compelling minute by minute countdown which ends with her final walk to the scaffold, and her beheading by the hangman of Calais&apos; sword.\r\n\r\nThe book describes the actions and thoughts of some the leading players during those final 24 hours including Thomas Cranmer, Chapuys, Jane Seymour, Lady Mary, Sir William Kingston, Thomas Wyatt and, of course, the three principle players.\r\n\r\nHenry VIII - what was he doing as the woman he moved heaven and earth to marry faced execution. Did he feel remorse? Did he feel hatred? Did he feel anything at all?\r\n\r\nThomas Cromwell - widely accepted as the engineer behind the downfall of the queen. Did he feel guilt that even Chapuys was not convinced by the charges which sent Anne to her death?\r\n\r\nAnne Boleyn - just how did she manage to walk to the scaffold and address the crowd so bravely? How did she cope with the continual postponement of the execution? And what did she think of the men who would send her to the grave?\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-09-26T12:00:52.157Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:516a48341222127b311ae0ad29bac8aba77adfe1","dn":"Anne Boleyn_ The Final 24 Hours by Marcella Mayfair ePUB eBOOK-Z","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"516a48341222127b311ae0ad29bac8aba77adfe1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,106,72,52,18,34,18,123,49,26,224,173,41,186,200,171,167,122,223,225]},"name":"Anne Boleyn_ The Final 24 Hours by Marcella Mayfair ePUB eBOOK-Z","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
