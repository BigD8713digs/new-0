People are fleeing to the far north where conditions are still tolerable. Social order is crumbling and private security firms have undermined the police force.\r\n\r\nTapani Lehtinen, a struggling poet, is among the few still willing to live in the city. When Tapani&#x2019;s wife, Johanna, a journalist, goes missing, he embarks on a frantic hunt for her. Johanna&#x2019;s disappearance seems to be connected to a story she was researching about a serial killer known as &quot;The Healer&quot;. Determined to find Johanna, Tapani&#x2019;s search leads him to uncover secrets from her past - secrets that connect her to the very murders she was investigating.\r\n\r\nAtmospheric and moving, The Healer is a story of survival, loyalty and determination. Even when the world is coming to an end, love and hope endure.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-07-17T12:00:51.060Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c8f6e0b62fd9d4c1e005692c9fb34781aea3111","dn":"The Healer by Antti Tuomainen ePUB eBOOK-ZAK","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"9c8f6e0b62fd9d4c1e005692c9fb34781aea3111","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,143,110,11,98,253,157,76,30,0,86,146,201,251,52,120,26,234,49,17]},"name":"The Healer by Antti Tuomainen ePUB eBOOK-ZAK","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
