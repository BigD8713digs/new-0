The primary goal of the game is to carry out a series of assassinations ordered by Al Mualim, the leader of the Assassins. To achieve this goal, the player must travel from the Brotherhood&apos;s headquarters in Masyaf, across the terrain of the Holy Land known as the Kingdom to one of three cities&#x2014;Jerusalem, Acre, or Damascus&#x2014;to find the Brotherhood agent in that city. There, the agent, in addition to providing a safe house, gives the player minimal knowledge about the target, and requires them to perform additional &quot;recon&quot; missions before attempting the assassination. These missions include: eavesdropping, interrogation, pickpocketing and completing tasks for informers and fellow assassins. Additionally, the player may take part in any number of side objectives in these open world environments, including climbing tall towers to map out the city, and saving citizens who are being threatened or harassed by the city guards. There are also various side quests that do not advance the plot such as hunting down and killing Templars and flag collecting. After completing each set of assassinations, the player is returned back to the Brotherhood and rewarded with a better weapon and then given another set of targets, with the player free to select the order of certain targets.\r\n\r\nGameplay\r\n\r\nThe player is made aware of how noticeable Alta?r is to enemy guards as well as the current state of alert in the local area via the &quot;Social Status Icon&quot;. To perform many of the assassinations and other tasks, the player must consider the use of commands distinguished by its type of profile. Low-profile commands allow Alta?r to: blend into nearby crowds, pass by other citizens, or other non-threatening tasks that can be used to hide and reduce the alertness level; the player can also use Alta?r&apos;s retractable blade to attempt low-profile assassinations. High-profile commands are more noticeable, and include: running, scaling the sides of buildings to climb to higher vantage points, and attacking foes; performing these actions at certain times may raise the local area&apos;s awareness level. Once the area is at high alert, the crowds run and scatter while guards attempt to chase and bring down Alta?r; to reduce the alert level, the player must control Alta?r as to break the guards&apos; line of sight and then find a hiding space, such as a haystack or rooftop garden; or blend in with the citizens sitting on benches or wandering scholars. Should the player be unable to escape the guards, they can fight back using swordplay maneuvers","last_updated":"2017-08-09T12:01:20.450Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:dcc39e08bab163265c9628b71ec4365015253ee2","dn":"Assassins Creed Repack-RELOADED With Crack","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"dcc39e08bab163265c9628b71ec4365015253ee2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,195,158,8,186,177,99,38,92,150,40,183,30,196,54,80,21,37,62,226]},"name":"Assassins Creed Repack-RELOADED With Crack","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
