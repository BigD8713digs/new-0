Reporting for duty is strapping ex-army mechanic Daryl, but 20 minutes into the date, Sophie&apos;s convinced that Daryl&apos;s not the love of her life. As the floodgates open, waitress Laura provides a shoulder to cry on. Can she turn the tide for this unhappy couple? Plasterer Ryland, who&apos;s 33, has spent the last two years recovering from cocaine addiction. Now happy and healthy, this footy-mad lad would happily choose love over Spurs winning the league. He meets no-nonsense barmaid and West Ham fan Amanda- are they a match made in heaven?\r\n \n -----------------------------------------\n MEDIAINFO\n Container = Matroska (mkv)\n Duration = 00:46:35.104\n Filesize = 788 MiB\n --Video\n Codec info = AVC High@L4.1 | V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\n Resolution = 1280x720\n Display AR = 1.778 | 16:9\n Bitrate = 1 935 kb/s\n Encoder = x264 - core 157 r2946 d8180b8\n --Audio\n Codec info = AC-3 | A_AC3\n Channels = 2\n \n -----------------------------------------\n SCREENS\n  <a href=\" https://imgmak.com/image/rrc\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\"> https://imgmak.com/image/rrc</a>\n \n  <a href=\" https://imgmak.com/image/rrn\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\"> https://imgmak.com/image/rrn</a>\n \n  <a href=\" https://imgmak.com/image/rrr\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\"> https://imgmak.com/image/rrr</a>\n \n  <a href=\" https://imgmak.com/image/rrB\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\"> https://imgmak.com/image/rrB</a>\n \n  <a href=\" https://imgmak.com/image/rrI\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\"> https://imgmak.com/image/rrI</a>\n \n  <a href=\" https://imgmak.com/image/rrq\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\"> https://imgmak.com/image/rrq</a>","last_updated":"2018-09-26T12:06:15.980Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:c57437c54ecc3442ee2c71682a36bc5287801e97","dn":"Firsts.Hotel.S03E04.720p.HDTV.X264-CREED[TGx]","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"c57437c54ecc3442ee2c71682a36bc5287801e97","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,116,55,197,78,204,52,66,238,44,113,104,42,54,188,82,135,128,30,151]},"name":"Firsts.Hotel.S03E04.720p.HDTV.X264-CREED[TGx]","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
