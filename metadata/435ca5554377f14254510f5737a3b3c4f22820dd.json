Finally Focused details the natural methods used to treat problems such as nutritional deficiencies of magnesium or zinc, dysbiosis (a microbial imbalance inside the body), sleeping difficulties, and food allergies, all of which - unbeknownst to many - can cause or exacerbate the symptoms of ADHD. By exploring each of these possibilities in Dr. Greenblatt&apos;s Plus-Minus Healing Plan, parents will finally be able to get the assistance they need in providing true wellness for their children, whether or not they&apos;re already on medication. ADHD is a medical disorder, not a discipline problem, and this book addresses each individual&apos;s unique pattern of biological weaknesses to get at the root of the issue.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-04-16T12:14:25.775Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:435ca5554377f14254510f5737a3b3c4f22820dd","dn":"Finally Focused by James Greenblatt, Bill Gottlieb EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"435ca5554377f14254510f5737a3b3c4f22820dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,92,165,85,67,119,241,66,84,81,15,87,55,163,179,196,242,40,32,221]},"name":"Finally Focused by James Greenblatt, Bill Gottlieb EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
