The film was encoded from the 4K Blu-Ray @ 2MBPS in full frame 1080p. Sharpness has been increased. I have compared the picture to some other 4K versions and it is sharper with smaller file size. \r\nTheir are three audio tracks. The default is 5.1 AC3 Rifftrax by Mike, Kevin and Bill. The film audio is ducked so that you can always hear the comments but is ducked in such a way that you can&apos;t hear any volume change what is referred to as pumping. Half the reason I do these encodes is because I detest the volume pumping in other versions. It&apos;s super annoying to watch a film where the volume is constantly changing. The disembaudio que lines have been removed.\r\nThe second audio is 5.1 AC3 original film audio it has been boosted and cleaned. The third audio is 2.0 MP3 version of the Rifftrax with the que lines and no ducking. \r\nImages include film posters and folder icons. right click any of the three folders and choose customize and change folder icon. Browse to the images folder and choose the icon you like for that folder. \r\nSUBtitles are mostly SRT. There are 30 Subs. Some are in-sync and some are not. I left them standalone so that you may edit them as necessary. It is way to tedious to sync all these subs. \r\n\r\n    Spider-Man[2002]5.1-Rifftrax.4K.1080p.BR.x264-KmCrct.mkv\r\nFormat                                   : Matroska\r\nFile size                                : 2.48 GiB\r\nDuration                                 : 2 h 1 min\r\nOverall bit rate                         : 2 933 kb/s\r\n\r\nVideo\r\nFormat                                   : AVC\r\nCodec ID                                 : V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\r\nBit rate                                 : 2 000 kb/s\r\nWidth                                    : 1 920 pixels\r\nHeight                                   : 1 080 pixels\r\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 16:9\r\nFrame rate                               : 23.976 (24000/1001) FPS\r\n\r\nAudio #1\r\nFormat                                   : E-AC-3\r\nCodec ID                                 : A_EAC3\r\nBit rate                                 : 448 kb/s\r\nChannel(s)                               : 6 channels\r\nChannel positions                        : Front: L C R, Side: L R, LFE\r\nSampling rate                            : 48.0 kHz\r\nTitle                                    : 5.1 AC3 Rifftrax (M,K,B)\r\n\r\nAudio #2\r\nFormat                                   : E-AC-3\r\nCodec ID                                 : A_EAC3\r\nBit rate                                 : 448 kb/s\r\nChannel(s)                               : 6 channels\r\nChannel positions                        : Front: L C R, Side: L R, LFE\r\nSampling rate                            : 48.0 kHz\r\nTitle                                    : 5.1 AC3 Spider-Man\r\n\r\nAudio #3\r\nFormat                                   : MPEG Audio\r\nCodec ID                                 : A_MPEG/L3\r\nBit rate                                 : 56.0 kb/s\r\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\r\nSampling rate                            : 22.05 kHz\r\nTitle                                    : 2.0 MP3 Rifftrack","last_updated":"2017-07-30T12:04:01.929Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ca8bc5c0e88238592b24d1669adfde8c445f822","dn":"Spider-Man[2002]5.1-Rifftrax.4K.1080p.BR.x264-KmCrct","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"0ca8bc5c0e88238592b24d1669adfde8c445f822","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,168,188,92,14,136,35,133,146,178,77,22,105,173,253,232,196,69,248,34]},"name":"Spider-Man[2002]5.1-Rifftrax.4K.1080p.BR.x264-KmCrct","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
