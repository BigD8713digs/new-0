With beer on his mind, Rick hops over to his friend&#x2019;s brewery in San Diego to tap into the drink&#x2019;s history. Also, the guys track down an original McCormick Farmall tractor, but how far will they dig into their pockets for it? And later, Corey must decide if he wants to take action on a &#x201C;Django Unchained&#x201D; signed movie slate, while Chum figures out if a print of &#x201C;Dogs Playing Poker&#x201D; is a King or a Joker. \r\n\r\nPawn.Stars.S14E25.Great.Scott.WEB-DL.x264-JIVE \r\n\r\nTurn it up to eleven with the Pawn Stars when Rick gets offered a 1973 Marshall Amp.
