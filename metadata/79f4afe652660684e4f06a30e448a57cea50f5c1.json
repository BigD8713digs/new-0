His poems are marked by what biographer Andrew Motion calls a very English, glum accuracy about emotions, places, and relationships.  Recurring themes and subjects include death and fatalism, as in his final major poem &quot;Aubade&quot;.  Eric Homberger (echoing Randall Jarrell) called him &quot;the saddest heart in the post-war supermarket&quot;; Larkin himself said that deprivation for him was what daffodils were for Wordsworth.\n\nHere are Larkin&apos;s COMPLETE POEMS, bringing together all his books -- The North Ship (1945), The Less Deceived (1955), The Whitsun Weddings (1964), and High Windows (1974) -- and the uncollected poems from 1940 to 1984.  These include some unpublished pieces from the typescripts and workbooks, as well as verse -- by turns scurrilous, satirical, affectionate, and sentimental -- that had been tucked away in his letters.\n\nLarkin was a notable critic of modernism in contemporary art and literature.  His scepticism is at its most nuanced and illuminating in REQUIRED WRITING (1982), a collection of his book reviews and essays, and at its most inflamed and polemical in his Introduction to ALL WHAT JAZZ (1985), which contains an attack on modern jazz that widens into a wholesale critique of modernism in the arts.\n\nLarkin&apos;s public persona was that of the no-nonsense, solitary Englishman who disliked fame and had no patience for the trappings of the public literary life.  The posthumous publication by Anthony Thwaite of his SELECTED LETTERS (1993) triggered controversy about his personal life and political views, described by John Banville as hair-raising, but also in places hilarious.  Despite the controversy Larkin was chosen as &quot;the nation&apos;s best-loved poet&quot; in a 2003 survey, and in 2008 The Times named him as the greatest British post-war writer.\n\n\nThe following books are in ePUB format unless otherwise noted:\n\n\n                                 == POETRY ==\n\n* Collected Poems (FSG, 1989).
