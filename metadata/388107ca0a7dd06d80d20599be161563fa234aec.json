Shaw returns from the Korean War to an idolizing and unsuspecting country. In a farcical, uproarious scene, he is greeted amid flashbulbs and frock coats by his power-hungry, domineering mother and her politician husband, who have decided to use Shaw&apos;s fame to further their own unscrupulous ambitions. What follows is at once a spy story, a love story, and a sobering, yet outrageously funny satire on demagoguery in American politics. Two tender love stories provide an undercurrent theme: the powers of light against the powers of dark. Shaw, the pawn, the brainwashed, is caught between the forces struggling for his soul.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-06-29T12:14:31.663Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:388107ca0a7dd06d80d20599be161563fa234aec","dn":"The Manchurian Candidate by Richard Condon EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"388107ca0a7dd06d80d20599be161563fa234aec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,129,7,202,10,125,208,109,128,210,5,153,190,22,21,99,250,35,74,236]},"name":"The Manchurian Candidate by Richard Condon EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
