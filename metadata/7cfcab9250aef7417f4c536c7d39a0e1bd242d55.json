From crabs and bats to owls and cormorants, this episode investigates how much wildlife is living on the beach. The strandline&apos;s hidden world of sandhoppers and seaweed is magnified, while specialist underwater cameras give a view of sharks and crabs lying deep in the ocean. Dan Snow examines the royal origin of beach huts and sees how varied their use is in modern-day Britain. Lucy Cooke demonstrates how a humble mollusc helps to train racehorses in Devon. Niall Strawson is in charge of the Discovery Centre, where a panel of experts examine and assess the significance of beach finds from all over the country. And the creation of the unique geological make-up of the Jurassic Coast is seen through the medium of cake! Earth scientist Dr Anjana Khatwa talks Niall through the layers as seen from the sea.\r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC High L3.1\r\n * Video Bitrate: CRF 20\r\n * Video Resolution: 1280x720\r\n * Frame Rate: 25 FPS\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC-LC\r\n * Audio Bitrate: Q=0.46 VBR 48KHz (~126Kbps)\r\n * Audio Channels: 2\r\n * Run-Time: 59 mins\r\n * Number Of Parts: 3\r\n * Part Size: 1.24 GB (average)\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Subtitles: Merged","last_updated":"2018-07-20T12:08:52.552Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:7cfcab9250aef7417f4c536c7d39a0e1bd242d55","dn":"BBC Beach Live Jurassic Coast Revealed 3of3 720p x264 AAC HDTV M","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"7cfcab9250aef7417f4c536c7d39a0e1bd242d55","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,252,171,146,80,174,247,65,127,76,83,108,125,57,160,225,189,36,45,85]},"name":"BBC Beach Live Jurassic Coast Revealed 3of3 720p x264 AAC HDTV M","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
