Does it disappear? Three decades ago, a young physicist named Stephen Hawking claimed that it did - and in doing so, put at risk everything we know about the fundamental laws of the universe. Leonard Susskind and Gerard &apos;t Hooft realized the threat and responded with a counterattack that changed the course of physics.\r\n\r\nThe Black Hole War is the thrilling story of their united effort to reconcile Hawking&apos;s theories of black holes with their own sense of reality, an effort that would eventually result in Hawking admitting he was wrong and Susskind and &apos;t Hooft realizing that our world is a hologram projected from the outer boundaries of space.\r\n\r\nA brilliant book about the deepest mysteries of modern physics, The Black Hole War is mind-bending and an exhilarating read.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-08-17T12:03:01.849Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e8abb0c670a30982906a8f1c07b5681dbed30a8","dn":"The Black Hole War_ My Battle with Stephen Hawking to Make the W","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"4e8abb0c670a30982906a8f1c07b5681dbed30a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,138,187,12,103,10,48,152,41,6,168,241,192,123,86,129,219,237,48,168]},"name":"The Black Hole War_ My Battle with Stephen Hawking to Make the W","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
