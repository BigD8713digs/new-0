The instrumentation - four saxophones, used orchestrally and for the most part chordaly, contrabass, tuned percussion, rhythm programming and small electronics are sparsely used in highly compositional contexts. There&apos;s a great attention sound and the careful disposition of parts to maximum effect. Discipline, containment, dissonance, tension and the judicious use of the electronics and tuned percussion bind the otherwise spiky components into a cautious aesthetic unity. Strong rhythmical structures are grids not grooves, and there is always contrary motion to prevent closure; irresolution drives everything onward but not really forward. This is more like contemporary music than anything else, but it spends a lot of time not sounding like contemporary music, or rock, or jazz, or anything else much - except in passing. Another interesting record. - Chris Cutler, ReR Megacorp","last_updated":"2017-08-26T12:02:18.502Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:77b7d3ecdd06bb12a25b8df77fbbd7a4aab35091","dn":"Remote Viewers 2013 Crimeways","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"77b7d3ecdd06bb12a25b8df77fbbd7a4aab35091","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,183,211,236,221,6,187,18,162,91,141,247,127,187,215,164,170,179,80,145]},"name":"Remote Viewers 2013 Crimeways","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
