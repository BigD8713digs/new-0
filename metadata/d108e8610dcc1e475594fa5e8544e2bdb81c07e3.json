If you&#x2019;re Causa Sui, you don&#x2019;t overthink it: you write some tunes, run through&#x2019;em a bunch of times, and then hit the studio and lay the material down while it&#x2019;s fresh. Forget dithering over whether the music&#x2019;s post-rock, krautrock, or psychedelic rock; simply call Return to Sky instrumental rock and get on with it. Labels matter little when the music burns with the kind of intensity it does here. \r\nProduced by Jonas Munk, the five-track set sees the guitarist, keyboardist Rasmus Rasmussen, bassist Jess Kahr, and drummer Jakob Sk&#xF8;tt powering their way through 45 minutes of pure Causa Sui material. The four by now have achieved an unforced and natural cohesiveness that makes playing together as effortless as it is satisfying. While the band is a central concern for all involved, each member has other irons in the fire, all of which feeds back into the group project when they reconvene. \r\nWith ten minutes to work with, it doesn&#x2019;t surprise that the opening &#x201C;Dust Meridian&#x201D; passes through many stages before reaching its destination. Following a thunderous introductory section animated by a guitar riff of elephantine size, the band seemingly exits the studio, hops in the car, and takes a spin through the Swedish countryside to breathe in fresh air and absorb the scenery. &#x201C;The Source&#x201D; serves up six minutes of sludge rock that reveals why the stoner rock label&#x2019;s been affixed to Causa Sui a good many times. Unlike some bands that favour high-pitched wail, Munk and company go for bruising, low-end riffs that give the music a deliciously raw feel, and the track also shows that in amongst whatever else one might hear in Causa Sui&#x2019;s mix there&#x2019;s a place for Nirvana-styled noise, too. \r\n\r\nTracklist: \r\n01 - Dust Meridian.flac \r\n02 - The Source.flac \r\n03 - Mondo Buzzo.flac \r\n04 - Dawn Passage.flac \r\n05 - Return To Sky.flac \r\n\r\nSummary: \r\nCountry: Denmark \r\nGenre: post-rock, psychedelic rock","last_updated":"2018-07-16T12:05:08.468Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:d108e8610dcc1e475594fa5e8544e2bdb81c07e3","dn":"[post-rock, psychedelic rock] (2016) Causa Sui - Return to Sky [","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"d108e8610dcc1e475594fa5e8544e2bdb81c07e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,8,232,97,13,204,30,71,85,148,250,94,133,68,226,189,184,28,7,227]},"name":"[post-rock, psychedelic rock] (2016) Causa Sui - Return to Sky [","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
