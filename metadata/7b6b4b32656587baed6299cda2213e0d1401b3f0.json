ARCHICAD 21 introduces the highly-anticipated Stair Tool, featuring GRAPHISOFT&#x13A;s patent-pending Predictive Design&#xD6; technology. ARCHICAD 21 delivers a number of other, important functional improvements in the fields of visualization, OPEN BIM, performance and productivity making this version one of the strongest in GRAPHISOFT&#x13A;s history.\r\n\r\nAs any drafter or architect knows, designing stairs is fraught with challenges. Not only do strict building standards complicate stair design, but iterations of a building&#x13A;s structure mean there&#x13A;s a tremendous amount of tedious reworking of the stair design each time a project is modified. In ARCHICAD 21, this has all changed. According to GRAPHISOFT, drafters will now have access to automated stair design tools that work in the background to create an optimal stair configuration that&#x13A;s building specific. All users need to do now is create a polyline to guide the direction of the stairs and wait for the ARCHICAD stair algorithm to offer up stair design options. Once a stair design has been chosen, an associated railing can be added with a simple single-click operation that completes the climbing feature.\r\n\r\nBeyond the time-saving stair tool, ARCHICAD 21 also features an upgraded CineRender engine, which can be used to create photorealistic images of building interiors and exteriors.\r\n\r\nElement classification has also been enhanced in the new package as any ARCHICAD model can now be described as central BIM database that contains all project data. This new, flexible method for classification makes it possible to support and share any element of a national or corporate standard, making it easier for various partners and suppliers to interact with a design","last_updated":"2017-11-08T12:23:07.413Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b6b4b32656587baed6299cda2213e0d1401b3f0","dn":"ARCHICAD 21 Build 4022 Win64 (update only)   crack","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"7b6b4b32656587baed6299cda2213e0d1401b3f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,107,75,50,101,101,135,186,237,98,153,205,162,33,62,13,20,1,179,240]},"name":"ARCHICAD 21 Build 4022 Win64 (update only)   crack","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
