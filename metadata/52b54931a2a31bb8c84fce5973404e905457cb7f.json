A sabbatical from teaching in San Francisco allowed her to return to Cortona - and her beloved house, Bramasole - just as the first green appeared on the rocky hillsides. Bella Tuscany, a companion volume to Under the Tuscan Sun, is Mayes&apos; passionate and lyrical account of her continuing love affair with Italy. Now truly at home there, Mayes writes of her deepening connection to the land, her flourishing friendships with local people, the joys of art, food, and wine, and the rewards and occasional heartbreaks of her villa&apos;s ongoing restoration. It is also a memoir of a season of change, and of renewed possibility. As spring becomes summer she revives Bramasole&apos;s lush gardens, meets the challenges of learning a new language, tours regions from Sicily to the Veneto, and faces transitions in her family life. Filled with recipes from her Tuscan kitchen and written in the sensuous and evocative prose that has become her hallmark, Bella Tuscany is a celebration of the sweet life in Italy.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-07-01T12:14:49.675Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:52b54931a2a31bb8c84fce5973404e905457cb7f","dn":"Bella Tuscany: The Sweet Life in Italy by Frances Mayes EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"52b54931a2a31bb8c84fce5973404e905457cb7f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,181,73,49,162,163,27,184,200,79,206,89,115,64,78,144,84,87,203,127]},"name":"Bella Tuscany: The Sweet Life in Italy by Frances Mayes EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
