And after the daughter of a murder victim turns up outside his flat, he&apos;s going to need them at their sharpest. \r\nEnlisting the help of his old friend DI Siobhan Clarke, Rebus is determined to solve this cold case once and for all. But Clarke has problems of her own, problems that will put her at odds with her long-time mentor and push him into seeking help from his age-old adversary: &apos;Big Ger&apos; Cafferty. \r\nThis haunting story takes Rebus to places he has never been before, sets him and his long-time foe on a collision course and takes us deeper into one of the most satisfying conflicts in modern fiction. \r\nFeaturing an introduction from Rankin himself, a Q&amp;A between writers Ian and Rona, an interview with the director, and behind-the-scenes production materials, this book is one Rebus fans will not want to miss out on. \r\n\r\nGenre: Fiction &gt; Mystery/Thriller","last_updated":"2018-10-06T12:19:15.853Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:990f4a859e93f1418c8d65705497236730723842","dn":"Rebus: Long Shadows: The New Play by Ian Rankin (.epub)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"990f4a859e93f1418c8d65705497236730723842","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,15,74,133,158,147,241,65,140,141,101,112,84,151,35,103,48,114,56,66]},"name":"Rebus: Long Shadows: The New Play by Ian Rankin (.epub)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
