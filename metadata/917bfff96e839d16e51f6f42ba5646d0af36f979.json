His masterpiece, The Birds of America depicts almost five hundred North American bird species, each image-lifelike and life size-rendered in vibrant color. Audubon was also an explorer, a woodsman, a hunter, an entertaining and prolific writer, and an energetic self-promoter. Through talent and dogged determination, he rose from backwoods obscurity to international fame.\r\nIn This Strange Wilderness, award-winning author Nancy Plain brings together the amazing story of this American icon&apos;s career and the beautiful images that are his legacy. Before Audubon, no one had seen, drawn, or written so much about the animals of this largely uncharted young country. Aware that the wilderness and its wildlife were changing even as he watched, Audubon remained committed almost to the end of his life &quot;to search out the things which have been hidden since the creation of this wondrous world.&quot; This Strange Wilderness details his art and writing, transporting the reader back to the frontiers of early nineteenth-century America.\r\n\r\nAbout the Author <a href=\"\nhttps://s14.postimg.org/rj63vf0ep/Nancy_Plain.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://s14.postimg.org/rj63vf0ep/Nancy_Plain.jpg</a>\r\nNancy Plain is an award-winning writer of biographies and histories for young readers--and readers of all ages.
