It shows real-time graphs and can create reports and alerts based on your downloads and uploads. DU Meter includes extensive logging facility, flexible events system, and more. DU Meter works with virtually all types of network connections: phone modems, DSL, cable modem, LAN, satellite, and more.Have you ever found yourself wondering why some downloads seem to take an eternity to complete, or why your e-mail program seems to be stuck in the middle of e-mail retrieval. Is it really hanging, or maybe it&#x2019;s just downloading a large e-mail attachment? DU Meter provides the answer to these and other mysteries, and can also alert you of dangerous or unexpected network activity. Watching your data transfer rates can be very enlightening no matter what you do online, and you&#x2019;ll soon be wondering how you managed without DU Meter before.\r\n\r\nIf you have teenage children or if you own or manage a small business, you already know how hard it is to enforce certain rules for network usage, while respecting child&#x2019;s or employee&#x2019;s privacy. If you install DU Meter on your child&#x2019;s or employee&#x2019;s computer, you can configure it to report back to you via email when monthly or weekly network traffic exceeds a certain threshold. DU Meter will let you know if someone is breaking your rules (For example using peer-to-peer software to share films and music). Since DU Meter 5, the software can even prevent any further Internet connectivity once the alert condition has been met, without any user intervention","last_updated":"2017-12-03T12:05:11.395Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b005ac47d437e49a9b86b5b9baa057c6880c85f","dn":"DU Meter v7.24 Build 4765 Final   Patch - [SH]","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"0b005ac47d437e49a9b86b5b9baa057c6880c85f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,0,90,196,125,67,126,73,169,184,107,91,155,170,5,124,104,128,200,95]},"name":"DU Meter v7.24 Build 4765 Final   Patch - [SH]","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
