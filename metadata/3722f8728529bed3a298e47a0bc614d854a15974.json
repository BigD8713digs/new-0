Now comes his most engrossing work yet. Beginning in the 1850s, Bradley introduces us to the prominent Americans who made their fortunes in the China opium trade. As they - good Christians all - profitably addicted millions, American missionaries arrived, promising salvation for those who adopted Western ways.\r\n\r\nAnd that was just the beginning.\r\n\r\nFrom drug dealer Warren Delano to his grandson, Franklin Delano Roosevelt; from the port of Hong Kong to the towers of Princeton University; from the era of Appomattox to the age of the A-Bomb, The China Mirage explores a difficult century that defines US-Chinese relations to this day.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-07-01T12:14:04.945Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:3722f8728529bed3a298e47a0bc614d854a15974","dn":"The China Mirage by James Bradley EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"3722f8728529bed3a298e47a0bc614d854a15974","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,34,248,114,133,41,190,211,162,152,228,122,11,198,20,216,84,161,89,116]},"name":"The China Mirage by James Bradley EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
