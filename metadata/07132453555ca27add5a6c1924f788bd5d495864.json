The truths include statements such as &#x2018;It Has To Work.&#x2019; and &#x2018;Good, Fast, Cheap: Pick any two (you can&#x2019;t have all three).&#x2019;. This memo will be the underlying story line throughout the talk, as each truths has a corresponding position within the artist&#x2019;s artistic practice. \r\n <a href=\"\nhttp://cdn.media.ccc.de/congress/2016/h264-hd/33c3-8191-eng-deu-The_12_Networking_Truths_hd.mp4\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttp://cdn.media.ccc.de/congress/2016/h264-hd/33c3-8191-eng-deu-The_12_Networking_Truths_hd.mp4</a>","last_updated":"2017-04-25T12:39:32.729Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:07132453555ca27add5a6c1924f788bd5d495864","dn":"33c3-8191-eng-deu-The_12_Networking_Truths_hd.mp4","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"07132453555ca27add5a6c1924f788bd5d495864","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,19,36,83,85,92,162,122,221,90,108,25,36,247,136,189,93,73,88,100]},"name":"33c3-8191-eng-deu-The_12_Networking_Truths_hd.mp4","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
