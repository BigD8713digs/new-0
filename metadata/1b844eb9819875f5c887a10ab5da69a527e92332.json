Based on Ray Romano&apos;s actual life, the show also took much of its material from Phil&apos;s equally, and hysterically, dysfunctional family characters and experiences.\r\n\r\nBesides being one of the funniest books ever written about television, You&apos;re Lucky You&apos;re Funny is one of the most illuminating, Phil offers an unprecedented look at the making of a hit show, considering everything from casting to writing to production to managing egos to keeping a series fresh after it has comfortably settled in for the long haul.\r\n\r\nFor anyone who loves comedy, for the millions of devoted fans of Everybody Love Raymond, and for all the aspiring writers who are edging their way toward Hollywood, You&apos;re Lucky You&apos;re Funny will be a gift and an inspiration.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-07-01T12:13:05.106Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b844eb9819875f5c887a10ab5da69a527e92332","dn":"You're Lucky You're Funny by Phil Rosenthal EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"1b844eb9819875f5c887a10ab5da69a527e92332","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,132,78,185,129,152,117,245,200,135,161,10,181,218,105,165,39,233,35,50]},"name":"You're Lucky You're Funny by Phil Rosenthal EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
