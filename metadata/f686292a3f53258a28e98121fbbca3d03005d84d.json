And that ought to be enough. But it is never enough.\r\n\r\nIn 2016, Michael acted as reluctant minder to his son, Abraham Chabon, then 13, on a trip to Paris Men&#x2019;s Fashion Week.\r\n\r\nPossessed of a precocious sense of style, Abe was in his element chatting with designers he idolised and turning a critical eye to the most &apos;lit&apos; runway looks; Chabon Sr., whose interest in clothing stops at &apos;thrift-shopping for vintage Western shirts&apos;, was too hot.\r\n\r\nDespite his own indifference, however, what emerged was a deep respect for his son&apos;s passion, for his bravery in the face of conformity, and a sense of awe in seeing him transform into his own person.\r\n\r\nWith &apos;My Son, the Prince of Fashion&apos; at its centre, this collection features gems on the magic and mysteries of fatherhood. Whether you know the joy and struggles of being a father or were shaped by one, you will find a home in these stunning essays.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-05-21T12:00:53.510Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:f686292a3f53258a28e98121fbbca3d03005d84d","dn":"Pops: Fatherhood in Pieces by Michael Chabon EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"f686292a3f53258a28e98121fbbca3d03005d84d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,134,41,42,63,83,37,138,40,233,129,33,251,188,163,208,48,5,216,77]},"name":"Pops: Fatherhood in Pieces by Michael Chabon EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
