Inspired by games such as Shadow of Mordor, Assassins Creed and Mount &amp; Blade. But with more... cubes.\r\nYou&apos;ve returned home after being on holiday for 3,729 years.\r\n\r\nBe transformed from a Human, into a Warcube.\r\nCapture outposts and explore the world&apos;s secrets.\r\nFind treasures lost in ages past, as well as things not so treasured...\r\nLaunch yourself from catapults, to go places you probably ought not to. This is a physics based game in Early Access after all...\r\n\r\nWhile playing you may experience\r\nDynamic slow motion and speed ramping, similar to 300, but with cubes.\r\nHighly realistic cube physics...very complex stuff.\r\nA multitude of arrows being shot at you, as well as swords, axes and spears waved in your direction.\r\nExtreme combo kills in slow motion to make you look your best.\r\n\r\nNever has there been a game with this many cubes, that wasn&apos;t a Minecraft knockoff.\r\nThese cubes were made for battle, not building","last_updated":"2018-04-20T14:22:28.242Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:d5fe7a18e2f593906ea94cd22d2840934125fde5","dn":"Warcube [L] [ENG] (2017) (0.0.16v1)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"d5fe7a18e2f593906ea94cd22d2840934125fde5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,254,122,24,226,245,147,144,110,169,76,210,45,40,64,147,65,37,253,229]},"name":"Warcube [L] [ENG] (2017) (0.0.16v1)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
