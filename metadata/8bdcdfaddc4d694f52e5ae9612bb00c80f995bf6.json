However, the only downside of using such a new framework is manually writing form controls.  Material Design allows us to build Angular apps quickly and effortlessly, similar to how bootstrap works with CSS.  We will start first by scaffolding an Angular Material application, then customizing the layout and UI/UX.  Next, we will start exploring the Angular Material components starting with some navigation menu and icons.The goal here is to show that its also possible to use Angular Material components  to build apps quickly.   Later in this section, we will use a more advanced menu system where Angular Material is essentially taking over the whole application layout, with a side menu component.\r\n\r\nWho is the target audience?\r\n\r\n    Beginning or Intermediate Angular programmers. If you already know Material and have already build enterprise level apps, you already know this material.\r\n    Anyone who has used Angular before. Material will help any Angular programmer understand Angular and build faster.\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n\r\n    Some familiarity with Angular. If you have done any exercises in Angular, you know enough to do this course.\r\n    Either a Mac or PC. If you have Linux you can use the same code, but we do not go through Linux installations of Angular","last_updated":"2018-07-11T12:12:07.261Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:8bdcdfaddc4d694f52e5ae9612bb00c80f995bf6","dn":"Udemy - Material for Angular 6 - UI UX Ivy League Instructor","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"8bdcdfaddc4d694f52e5ae9612bb00c80f995bf6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,220,223,173,220,77,105,79,82,229,174,150,18,187,0,200,15,153,91,246]},"name":"Udemy - Material for Angular 6 - UI UX Ivy League Instructor","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
