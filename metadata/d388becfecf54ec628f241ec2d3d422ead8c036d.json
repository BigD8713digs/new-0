Hopelessly Human 7:10\r\n\r\nThis is the definitive Kansas recording and includes their most famous tune, &quot;Dust in the Wind.&quot; The band is in peak form and also churned out the single &quot;Point of Know Return,&quot; which is still played daily on classic rock stations. While their pop-oriented approach and standard rock guitar sound helped define the classic rock sound of the &apos;70s, careful listening reveals that this band&apos;s talent goes beyond colleagues such as Bachman-Turner Overdrive and Boston. Their arrangements and time signatures more accurately reflect the music of Yes and Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer. &quot;Paradox&quot; and &quot;The Spider&quot; are both excellent examples of their progressive approach. Unfortunately, the band always struggled to maintain a healthy balance of progression combined with pop. That made for such awkward moments here as &quot;Portrait (He Knew)&quot; and &quot;Lightning&apos;s Hand.&quot; Yet despite the minor inconsistencies and a dated sound, their interplay and superior musicianship make this both an essential classic rock and progressive rock recording. - Robert Taylor, AMG","last_updated":"2017-06-18T12:01:39.416Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:d388becfecf54ec628f241ec2d3d422ead8c036d","dn":"Kansas 1977 Point Of Know Return (vinyl)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"d388becfecf54ec628f241ec2d3d422ead8c036d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,136,190,207,236,245,78,198,40,242,65,236,45,61,66,46,173,140,3,109]},"name":"Kansas 1977 Point Of Know Return (vinyl)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
