Part field science, part conservation science, Backyard Bears looks at black bears&#x2014;and other animals around the globe&#x2014;who are rapidly becoming our neighbors in urban and suburban areas.\r\nNorth Carolina&apos;s black bears were once a threatened species, but now their numbers are rising in and around Asheville. Can humans and bears live compatibly? What are the long-term effects for the bears? Author Amy Cherrix follows the scientists who, in cooperation with local citizens, are trying to answer to these questions and more.\r\n\r\nAbout the Author\r\nAmy Cherrix holds a Master&#x2019;s degree in children&#x2019;s literature from Simmons College and works as a children&#x2019;s book buyer at a fiercely independent bookstore.
