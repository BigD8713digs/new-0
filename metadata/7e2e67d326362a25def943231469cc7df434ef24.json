Seen through the eyes of Jan Zumbach, fighter ace and adventurer, it tells how the Poles, driven across Europe by the German war machine, finally made their last stand. Flying Hurricanes for the RAF over Britain, they became a key component in the legend of &#x2018;The Few&#x2019;. Up against the might of the Luftwaffe they hoped that, by saving Great Britain from Nazi invasion, they were keeping the dream of a free Poland alive.\n \n COVER <a href=\" https://imgmak.com/image/S73\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\"> https://imgmak.com/image/S73</a>\n \n MEDIAINFO\n Container = Matroska (mkv)\n Duration = 01:47:37.000\n Filesize = 3 GiB\n --Video\n Codec info = AVC Main@L3.1 | V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\n Resolution = 1280x530\n Display AR = 2.415 | 2.40:1\n Bitrate = 4 069 kb/s\n Framerate = CFR 24.000\n Color space = YUV\n Chroma subsampling = 4:2:0\n Encoder = \n --Audio\n Codec info = AC-3 | A_AC3\n Channels = 6\n Bitrate = CBR 384 kb/s\n Samplerate = 48.0 kHz\n Language = English\n \n SCREENS\n  <a href=\" https://imgmak.com/image/S7G\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\"> https://imgmak.com/image/S7G</a>\n \n  <a href=\" https://imgmak.com/image/S7H\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\"> https://imgmak.com/image/S7H</a>\n \n  <a href=\" https://imgmak.com/image/S7v\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\"> https://imgmak.com/image/S7v</a>\n \n  <a href=\" https://imgmak.com/image/S7y\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\"> https://imgmak.com/image/S7y</a>\n \n  <a href=\" https://imgmak.com/image/S76\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\"> https://imgmak.com/image/S76</a>\n \n  <a href=\" https://imgmak.com/image/S79\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\"> https://imgmak.com/image/S79</a>","last_updated":"2018-09-07T12:04:25.325Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e2e67d326362a25def943231469cc7df434ef24","dn":"Hurricane.2018.720p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-CMRG[TGx]","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"7e2e67d326362a25def943231469cc7df434ef24","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,46,103,211,38,54,42,37,222,249,67,35,20,105,204,125,244,52,239,36]},"name":"Hurricane.2018.720p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-CMRG[TGx]","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
