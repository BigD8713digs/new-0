Putting it down.&quot; (Miami Herald)\r\nThe new novel from Liane Moriarty, the #1 New York Times best-selling author of The Husband&#x2019;s Secret, Big Little Lies, and What Alice Forgot, about how sometimes we don&#x2019;t appreciate how extraordinary our ordinary lives are until it&#x2019;s too late.\r\nSix responsible adults. Three cute kids. One small dog. It&#x2019;s just a normal weekend. What could possibly go wrong? In Truly Madly Guilty, Liane Moriarty turns her unique, razor-sharp eye towards three seemingly happy families.\r\nSam and Clementine have a wonderful, albeit, busy life: they have two little girls, Sam has just started a new dream job, and Clementine, a cellist, is busy preparing for the audition of a lifetime. If there&#x2019;s anything they can count on, it&#x2019;s each other.\r\nClementine and Erika are each other&#x2019;s oldest friends. A single look between them can convey an entire conversation.
