But have you ever heard of:\r\n\r\nAlice Ball, the chemist who developed an effective treatment for leprosy - only to have the credit taken by a man?\r\n\r\nMary Sherman Morgan, the rocket scientist whose liquid fuel compounds blasted the first US satellite into orbit?\r\n\r\nHuang Daopo, the inventor whose weaving technology revolutionized textile production in China centuries before the cotton gin?\r\n\r\nSmart women have always been able to achieve amazing things, even when the odds were stacked against them. In Wonder Women, author Sam Maggs tells the stories of the brilliant, brainy, and totally rad women in history who broke barriers as scientists, engineers, mathematicians, adventurers, and inventors. Also features interviews with real-life women in STEM careers, an extensive bibliography, and a guide to women-centric science and technology organizations - all to show the many ways the geeky girls of today can help to build the future","last_updated":"2017-06-15T12:01:33.349Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:aad806ec65598c5c4067a5590f48fe45da961897","dn":"Sam Maggs - Wonder Women 2016 RETAiL ePUB eBOOK-DiSTRiBUTiON","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"aad806ec65598c5c4067a5590f48fe45da961897","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,216,6,236,101,89,140,92,64,103,165,89,15,72,254,69,218,150,24,151]},"name":"Sam Maggs - Wonder Women 2016 RETAiL ePUB eBOOK-DiSTRiBUTiON","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
