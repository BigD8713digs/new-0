R. Ward&apos;s thrilling finale to her Bourbon Kings series, the Bradford family dynasty teeters on the edge of collapse after the murder of their patriarch - and a shocking arrest.\r\n\r\nAt first the death of William Baldwine, the head of the Bradford family, was ruled a suicide. But then his eldest son and sworn enemy, Edward, came forward and confessed to what was, in fact, a murder. Now in police custody, Edward mourns not the disintegration of his family or his loss of freedom...but the woman he left behind. His love, Sutton Smythe, is the only person he has ever truly cared about, but as she is the CEO of the Bradford Bourbon Company&apos;s biggest competitor, any relationship between them is impossible. And then there&apos;s the reality of the jail time that Edward is facing.\r\n\r\nLane Baldwine was supposed to remain in his role of playboy, forever in his big brother Edward&apos;s shadow. Instead he has become the new head of the family and the company. Convinced that Edward is covering for someone else, Lane and his true love, Lizzie King, go on the trail of a killer - only to discover a secret that is as devastating as it is game changing.\r\n\r\nAs Lane rushes to discover the truth and Sutton finds herself irresistibly drawn to Edward in spite of his circumstances, the lives of everyone at Easterly will never be the same again. For some this is good; for others it could be a tragedy beyond imagining. Only one thing is for certain: Love survives all things. Even murder.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-08-02T12:01:01.941Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d89c92b56d5289efe4993518148cacd3c98b55d","dn":"Devil's Cut (Bourbon Kings series_book 3) by J R Ward ePUB eBOOK","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"9d89c92b56d5289efe4993518148cacd3c98b55d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,137,201,43,86,213,40,158,254,73,147,81,129,72,202,205,60,152,181,93]},"name":"Devil's Cut (Bourbon Kings series_book 3) by J R Ward ePUB eBOOK","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
