Also stars John Carradine, George Zucco and Ramsay Ames.\r\n\r\nIt was filmed from August 23-September 1, 1943, but not released until June 30, 1944 (copyrighted 1943). The final film in this series (The Mummy&apos;s Curse) was released 6 months later in December of the same year.\r\n\r\nI used a DVD print of the film with the Svengoolie segments edited in appropriately ( better picture quality for the film) and the original Air Date for this recording was 12-31-2016.\r\n\r\nEnjoy and requests are Welcome !! Unfortunately, Pirate Bay doesn&apos;t have a notification system for messages, so yours may go unread for some time.
