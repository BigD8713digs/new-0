Cooper - Our Ultimate Reality, Life, the Universe and Destiny of Mankind (pdf) - roflcopter2110\r\n <a href=\"\nhttps://extraimage.net/image/TqUL\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://extraimage.net/image/TqUL</a>\r\n\r\n&quot;From the earliest days of thinking man, people the world over have pondered the nature of the Universe, our planet, and of ourselves. What does it all mean? Why am I here? What is the real purpose of my life? What will happen to me after I die? Will I return once again for another life on Earth?&quot; So starts the first paragraph of this book, summarising and encapsulating very succinctly both the reason I was inspired to write Our Ultimate Reality and a concise summary of the contents contained therein. As we approach the end of a great age for humanity, increasingly more people from all walks of what we know as &quot;life&quot; are asking what it all means for them, for their families and for their future existence on this planet we call &quot;Earth&quot;. Our Ultimate Reality, Life, the Universe and Destiny of Mankind is your complete reference and guide for realising the Divine heritage of each and every one of us as equal aspects of our Creator, a life of perfect happiness, health, abundance, fulfilment and Spiritual evolution. This book has been written in a modern, understandable, non-mystical way, setting out in a concise, logical, easy to follow format, all you need to know in order to understand, pursue and realise your own true potential during this pivotally important era. I wish you every possible success as you follow your own true destiny on the path of return to our Divine Creator from Whom we came in the beginning, and wish that this book will prove to be your valuable guide and companion","last_updated":"2017-09-10T12:08:51.714Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:269fb3cefc483900a5ce84b10e172a2dbf509e89","dn":"Adrian P.
