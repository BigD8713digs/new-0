DERRINGER plays with total control and almost flawless technique. He could have spoiled it by including pyrotechnics alien to the blues ( I am sure he could be as showy as the next axe slinger ), but refrains and keeps everything tastefull and fairly true to the best of the originals. ( not many can play as well as he can ). It must be said that his vocals are OK, but no more than that. His choice of material is mostly brilliant, but a couple of tracks are questionable ( RUNNIN BLUE / FUNKY MUSIC / STILL ALIVE AND WELL ).However KEY TO THE HIGHWAY / BLUES DELUXE / KILLING FLOOR and HIDE AWAY 1962 are worth the price alone. This is on par with the best blues offerings from GARY MOORE and should be added to your collection of outstanding electric blues masters","last_updated":"2017-05-27T08:55:32.251Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd41c7f0dfbcaf1a72ebf28424bc31f5cb3cf949","dn":"Rick Derringer-Blues Deluxe (excellent electric blues guitar)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"fd41c7f0dfbcaf1a72ebf28424bc31f5cb3cf949","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,65,199,240,223,188,175,26,114,235,242,132,36,188,49,245,203,60,249,73]},"name":"Rick Derringer-Blues Deluxe (excellent electric blues guitar)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
