If not for her friend Nichole, Beth would never have met Sam Carney, although first impressions have left Beth with serious doubts. Sam is everything Beth is not - and her parents&apos; worst nightmare: a tattooed auto mechanic who&apos;s rough around the edges. Reserved and smart as a whip, Beth isn&apos;t exactly Sam&apos;s usual beer-drinking, pool-playing type of woman, either.\r\n\r\nBut if not for an awkward setup one evening, Beth might never have left early and been involved in a car crash. And if not for Sam - who witnessed the terrifying ordeal, rushed to her aid, and stayed with her until help arrived - Beth might have been all alone, or worse. Yet as events play out, Sam feels compelled to check on Beth almost daily at the hospital - even bringing his guitar to play songs to lift her spirits. Soon their unlikely friendship evolves into an intense attraction that surprises them both.\r\n\r\nBefore long, Beth&apos;s strong-willed mother, Ellie, blows into town spouting harsh opinions, especially about Sam, and reopening old wounds with Sunshine. When shocking secrets from Sam&apos;s past are revealed, Beth struggles to reconcile her feelings. But when Beth goes a step too far, she risks losing the man and the life she&apos;s come to love.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-09-23T12:01:42.075Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:b62d688a66269ae436ab273284b3ccc116542bb7","dn":"If Not for You_ A Novel by Debbie Macomber ePUB eBOOK-ZAK","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"b62d688a66269ae436ab273284b3ccc116542bb7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,45,104,138,102,38,154,228,54,171,39,50,132,179,204,193,22,84,43,183]},"name":"If Not for You_ A Novel by Debbie Macomber ePUB eBOOK-ZAK","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
