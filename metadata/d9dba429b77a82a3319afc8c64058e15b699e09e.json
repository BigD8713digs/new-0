This is the department of careful improvisation and much of this works in the area of electro-acoustic sound treatments, even when it comes to playing the instruments as such. Each of these players consider his instrument(s) as a an object, a piece, an element that generates sound and together they craft some pretty intense stuff; they always listen closely to what the others are doing and respond and react when needed or simply do nothing when required. Quite intense at various times, due to the amount of sound information and sometimes because due to it&apos;s absence. That it perhaps contains all the usual things around such improvised matters, but in fact this is a great release. Intense, concentrated, but also playful and not entirely without humour. Quite a nice release indeed.  - Frans de Waard, Vital weekly","last_updated":"2017-07-30T12:04:02.024Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9dba429b77a82a3319afc8c64058e15b699e09e","dn":"Buttner, Lettow, Rodrigues, Torres 2014 Zwei Mal Zwei","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"d9dba429b77a82a3319afc8c64058e15b699e09e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,219,164,41,183,122,130,163,49,154,252,140,100,5,142,21,182,153,224,158]},"name":"Buttner, Lettow, Rodrigues, Torres 2014 Zwei Mal Zwei","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
