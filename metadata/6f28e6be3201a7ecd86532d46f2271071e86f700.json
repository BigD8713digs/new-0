Instead the Atthakavagga points to a direct and simple approach for attaining peace without requiring the adherence to doctrine. The value of the teachings it contains is not in the profundity of their philosophy or in their authority as scripture; rather, the value is found in the results they bring to those who live by them. Instead of doctrines to be believed, the Book of Eights describes means or practices for realizing peace. Gil Fronsdal&apos;s rigorous translation with commentary reveals the text to be of interest not only to Buddhists, but also to the ever-growing demographic of the spiritual-but-not-religious, who seek a spiritual life outside the structures of religion.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-09-26T12:04:36.400Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f28e6be3201a7ecd86532d46f2271071e86f700","dn":"The Buddha before Buddhism_ Wisdom from the Early Teachings by G","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"6f28e6be3201a7ecd86532d46f2271071e86f700","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,40,230,190,50,1,167,236,216,101,50,212,111,34,113,7,30,134,247,0]},"name":"The Buddha before Buddhism_ Wisdom from the Early Teachings by G","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
