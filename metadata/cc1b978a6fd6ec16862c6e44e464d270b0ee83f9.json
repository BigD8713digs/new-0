Indeed with Tamsin Grieg and Malvolia they have given a new \r\ntwist to the role playing in the play.  The featurette has some interviews \r\nbut I would read those after viewing. \r\n\r\n  Down a couple pages You can find Shakespeare&apos;s Globe on Screen Twelfth Night.  In that production Mark Rylance plays Olivia to a standing- with- no- elbow- room audience of the only Globe dvd performance using &quot;original practices.&quot;  As you can see the role playing in the NTLive show has a certain kind of mirror effect with the original practices version at the Globe.\r\n\r\nNotes written  November 26th  2017","last_updated":"2017-11-30T12:07:45.255Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc1b978a6fd6ec16862c6e44e464d270b0ee83f9","dn":"NTLive Shakespeare's Twelfth Night (2017)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"cc1b978a6fd6ec16862c6e44e464d270b0ee83f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,27,151,138,111,214,236,22,134,44,110,68,228,100,210,112,176,238,131,249]},"name":"NTLive Shakespeare's Twelfth Night (2017)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
