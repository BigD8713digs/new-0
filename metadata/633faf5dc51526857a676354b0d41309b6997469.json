Through her contemporary investigation, she stumbles onto a trail of long-hidden family secrets that connect her to Sarah. Julia finds herself compelled to retrace the girl&apos;s ordeal, from that terrible term in the Vel d&apos;Hiv&apos;, to the camps, and beyond. As she probes into Sarah&apos;s past, she begins to question her own place in France, and to reevaluate her marriage and her life.\r\n\r\nTatiana de Rosnay offers us a brilliantly subtle, compelling portrait of France under occupation and reveals the taboos and silence that surround this painful episode.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-07-18T12:00:20.537Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:633faf5dc51526857a676354b0d41309b6997469","dn":"Sarah's Key by Tatiana de Rosenay epub RtR","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"633faf5dc51526857a676354b0d41309b6997469","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,63,175,93,197,21,38,133,122,103,99,84,176,212,19,9,182,153,116,105]},"name":"Sarah's Key by Tatiana de Rosenay epub RtR","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
