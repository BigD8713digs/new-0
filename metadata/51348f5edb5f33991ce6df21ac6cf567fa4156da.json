Schlafend Erreicht Odysseus Ithaka 4:48\r\n\r\nust a cursory inspection of its extraordinary instrumentation will give listeners a reasonable idea of what Michael Vogt&apos;s Argonautika sounds like: blown and beaten electrified tubas, a vocoder, &quot;overdriven electronic devices,&quot; a saxetuba (i.e., an amplified tuba with a saxophone mouthpiece), and &quot;noisy, crackling&quot; tapes, all of which combine to produce some of the most ominous and unearthly tones imaginable. That is the point of the album, a loose retelling of Greek myths in seven sonic tableaux; and Vogt&apos;s distorted tuba sonorities paint vivid and sometimes disturbing scenes that suggest a strange, supernatural journey into deep and dangerous realms. Since Vogt provides the barest information about his methods in the liner notes, one must assume that he plays all the instrumental parts himself, and handles the electronic processing of materials with minimal assistance. In the sense that he manipulates sounds through various electronic means, Vogt&apos;s work is a descendant of the musique concr&#xE8;te experiments of the 1950s; and though his equipment may be more advanced and efficient, the music sounds uncannily like the early experimental works of Var&#xE8;se and Xenakis in its rawness and darkness. - Blair Sanderson, AMG","last_updated":"2017-07-15T12:02:03.955Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:51348f5edb5f33991ce6df21ac6cf567fa4156da","dn":"Michael Vogt 2004 Argonautika","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"51348f5edb5f33991ce6df21ac6cf567fa4156da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,52,143,94,219,95,51,153,28,230,223,33,172,108,245,103,250,65,86,218]},"name":"Michael Vogt 2004 Argonautika","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
