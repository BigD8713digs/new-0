But the tables are turned when they find out they must judge themselves! Then they&apos;re thrown in the deep end when People Magazine editor-in-chief Jess Cagle splits them into two teams to judge and evaluate mentors Bobby Flay and Giada De Laurentiis on their own dishes. What the finalists don&apos;t know is that the bottom two on each panel will compete in a sudden death cook-off, and two finalists will be sent packing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal Air Date: 01-Jul-2018","last_updated":"2018-07-03T12:12:54.817Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:e1a6fb681c499fc759f9021bd547f48dba0888be","dn":"Food.Network.Star.S14E04.Panic.on.the.Panel.HDTV.x264-NY2.mkv","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"e1a6fb681c499fc759f9021bd547f48dba0888be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,166,251,104,28,73,159,199,89,249,2,27,213,71,244,141,186,8,136,190]},"name":"Food.Network.Star.S14E04.Panic.on.the.Panel.HDTV.x264-NY2.mkv","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
