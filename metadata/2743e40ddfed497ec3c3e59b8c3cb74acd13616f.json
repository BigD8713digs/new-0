Between 1647 and 1697, at least\r\nthirty-four men and women from across the state were formally charged with\r\nwitchcraft. Eleven were hanged. In New Haven, William Meeker was accused of\r\ncutting off and burning his pig&#x2019;s ears and tail as he cast a bewitching spell.\r\nAfter the hanging of Fairfield&#x2019;s Goody Knapp, magistrates cut down and searched\r\nher body for the marks of the devil. Through newspaper clippings, court\r\nrecords, letters and diaries, author Cynthia Wolfe Boynton uncovers the dark\r\nhistory of the Connecticut witch trials","last_updated":"2018-07-22T12:14:24.798Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:2743e40ddfed497ec3c3e59b8c3cb74acd13616f","dn":"Connecticut Witch Trials: The First Panic in the New World .epub","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"2743e40ddfed497ec3c3e59b8c3cb74acd13616f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,67,228,13,223,237,73,126,195,195,229,155,140,60,183,74,205,19,97,111]},"name":"Connecticut Witch Trials: The First Panic in the New World .epub","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
