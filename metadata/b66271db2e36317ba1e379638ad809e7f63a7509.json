Feeling ashamed of your family situation.\r\n\r\nWhat was really good about it was that how the bullying and events in school happened felt real. I could relate to it strongly and recognize those events from my school years.\r\n\r\nIt was how it happens in Europe at least. If you compare the way the bullying is done in a normal Hollywood studio film, this felt more real.\r\n\r\nThe other real strength in this film is the acting. It is directed superbly and also the role of the mother is a very good one. Her character is strongly written.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut with it&apos;s weakness, it was still a very good film","last_updated":"2017-10-23T12:05:41.286Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:b66271db2e36317ba1e379638ad809e7f63a7509","dn":"Sebbe (2010).ENG Subs","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"b66271db2e36317ba1e379638ad809e7f63a7509","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,98,113,219,46,54,49,123,161,227,121,99,138,216,9,231,246,58,117,9]},"name":"Sebbe (2010).ENG Subs","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
