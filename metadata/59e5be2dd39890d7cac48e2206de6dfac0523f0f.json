When a good friend disappears without a trace, Raf&apos;s efforts to find him will lead gradually and then suddenly right into the thick of a massive corporate conspiracy. And along the way, he falls in love with a stunningly beautiful young woman, only to discover that there is far more to Cherish than meets the eye.\r\n\r\nCombining the pace, drama, and explosive plot twists of a thriller with his trademark intellectual, linguistic, and comedic pyrotechnics, Glow is Ned Beauman&apos;s most compelling and virtuosic novel yet.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-09-22T12:26:54.189Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:59e5be2dd39890d7cac48e2206de6dfac0523f0f","dn":"Glow by Ned Beauman EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"59e5be2dd39890d7cac48e2206de6dfac0523f0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,229,190,45,211,152,144,215,202,196,142,34,6,222,109,250,192,82,63,15]},"name":"Glow by Ned Beauman EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
