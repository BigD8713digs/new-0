The Triumph of Art\r\nThink Renaissance and you think of Italy. But in the 15th and 16th centuries, the great Islamic empires experienced their own extraordinary cultural flowering. The two phenomena did not unfold in separate artistic universes - they were acutely conscious of, and in competition with, each other and mutually open to influences flowing both ways. The fifth film in Civilisations goes east and west with Simon Schama - to Papal Rome, but also to Ottoman Istanbul and Mughal Lahore and Agra, exploring those connections and rivalries, and examining how the role of artists from the different traditions of west and east developed in the years that followed the Renaissances.\r\n\r\nTechnical Spec\r\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC High L4.1\r\nVideo Bitrate: CRF 21.5 (~3133Kbps)\r\nVideo Resolution: 1920x1080\r\nFrame Rate: 25 FPS\r\nAudio Codec: AAC-LC\r\nAudio Bitrate: Q=0.45 VBR 48KHz (~128Kbps)\r\nAudio Channels: 2\r\nRun-Time: 59 mins\r\nNumber of Parts: 9\r\nPart Size: 1.34 GB\r\nSource: HDTV\r\nSubtitles: Merged","last_updated":"2018-03-30T12:10:49.366Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:92c79a207bcbeec57683a86c6b5bbca89390556c","dn":"BBC Civilisations 5of9 1080p HDTV x264-MVGroup","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"92c79a207bcbeec57683a86c6b5bbca89390556c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,199,154,32,123,203,238,197,118,131,168,108,107,91,188,168,147,144,85,108]},"name":"BBC Civilisations 5of9 1080p HDTV x264-MVGroup","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
