Of course Glenn Hughes use to be the singer/bassist for Deep Purple while Joe Lynn Turner was the singer for Rainbow for a spell. Together they create one infectious and memorable AOR disc. The production is outstanding, as is the songwriting and musicianship. This is in part due to the inclusion of several very well known guest musicians, including guitarist Paul Gilbert and ex-Thin Lizzy/Whitesnake axeman John Sykes. Besides co-singing on every song but one, Glenn Hughes also plays bass on much of the album. \r\n\r\nTracklist Disk 1\r\n\r\n1 - Intro.mp3\r\n2 - Hold On.mp3\r\n3 - You Can&apos;t Stop Rock &apos;n&apos; Roll.mp3\r\n4 - Death Alley Driver.mp3\r\n5 - Losing My Head.mp3\r\n6 - Alone I Breathe.mp3\r\n7 - Mistreated.mp3\r\n8 - Street Of Dreams.mp3\r\n\r\nDisk 2\r\n\r\n1 - Gettin&apos; Tighter.mp3\r\n2 - Bass Intro.mp3\r\n3 - You Keep On Moving.mp3\r\n4 - I Surrender.mp3\r\n5 - Ride The Storm.mp3\r\n6 - Devil&apos;s Road.mp3\r\n7 - Spotlight Kid.mp3\r\n8 - Burn.mp3\r\n9 - King Of Dreams.mp3\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are a few of these out there if you like.
