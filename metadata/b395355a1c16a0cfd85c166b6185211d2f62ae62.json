He was awarded the Icelandic Prize for Literature and has been nominated four times for the Nordic Council Prize for Literature.\n\nHe is best known for his epic and elemental trilogy of novels -- HEAVEN AND HELL (2007), THE SORROW OF ANGELS (2009), and THE HEART OF MAN (2011) -- set in a wintery Iceland before the end of the nineteenth century, when the population of that magical island relied on fishing for their survival.  The story revolves round &quot;the boy&quot;, an orphan with no name or age.  A rural Icelandic triptych unfolds on the fringes of the inhabited world, where the snowstorms of winter seem to go on forever.  J&#xF3;n Kalman exposes the human soul in graceful and lyrical descriptions of the barren landscape and the harsh lives of the fishermen and villagers, and in this conclusion to this audacious trilogy, he brings a poet&apos;s eye and a philosopher&apos;s insight to a tale worthy of the sagasmiths of old.  Boyd Tomkin wrote in The Independent that &quot;[his] immersive prose swells, thunders and sparkles with all the shifting moods of the sea on an Icelandic summer&apos;s day.&quot;\n\nHis most recent work, FISH HAVE NO FEET (2013), was longlisted for the 2017 Man Booker International Prize.\n\n\nThe following books, all translated by Philip Roughton, are in ePUB format unless otherwise noted:\n\n* Fish Have No Feet (MacLehose, 2016)\n* Heart of Man, The (MacLehose, 2015)\n* Heaven and Hell (MacLehose, 2011) -- ePUB + PDF\n* Sorrow of Angels, The (MacLehose, 2013)\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nCONTACT ME: You can reach me with comments, suggestions, requests, error reports, etc., at TPB&apos;s forum, SuprBay (you will need to register an account): <a href=\" https://pirates-forum.org/User-workerbee\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\"> https://pirates-forum.org/User-workerbee</a>  \n\nPLEASE HELP TO SEED!
