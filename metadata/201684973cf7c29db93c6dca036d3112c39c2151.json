We&apos;re told that learning is all self-discipline, that we must confine ourselves to designated study areas, turn off the music, and maintain a strict ritual if we want to ace that test, memorize that presentation, or nail that piano recital.\r\nBut what if almost everything we were told about learning is wrong?\r\n\r\nAnd what if there was a way to achieve more with less effort?\r\nIn How We Learn, award-winning science reporter Benedict Carey sifts through decades of education research and landmark studies to uncover the truth about how our brains absorb and retain information. What he discovers is that, from the moment we are born, we are all learning quickly, efficiently, and automatically; but in our zeal to systematize the process we have ignored valuable, naturally enjoyable learning tools like forgetting, sleeping, and daydreaming. Is a dedicated desk in a quiet room really the best way to study? Can altering your routine improve your memory? Are there times when distraction is good? Is ignorance always bad? Is repetition necessary? Carey&apos;s search for answers to these questions yields cunning strategies that make learning more a part of our everyday lives--and less of a chore.\r\n\r\nGenre: Non-Fiction &gt; psychology, learning","last_updated":"2018-09-22T12:18:45.967Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:201684973cf7c29db93c6dca036d3112c39c2151","dn":"How We Learn by Benedict Carey (.epub) ","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"201684973cf7c29db93c6dca036d3112c39c2151","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,22,132,151,60,247,194,157,185,60,109,202,3,109,49,18,195,156,33,81]},"name":"How We Learn by Benedict Carey (.epub) ","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
