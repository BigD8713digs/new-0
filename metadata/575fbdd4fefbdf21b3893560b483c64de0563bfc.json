It sustainably provided enough food to allow cities, nations, and empires to grow, but it did so with a different emphasis.\r\n\r\nWhere agriculture encouraged stability, fishing demanded movement. It frequently required a search for new and better fishing grounds; its technologies, centered on boats, facilitated movement and discovery; and fish themselves, when dried and salted, were the ideal food - lightweight, nutritious, and long-lasting - for traders, travelers, and conquering armies.\r\n\r\nThis history of the long interaction of humans and seafood tours archaeological sites worldwide to show readers how fishing fed human settlement, rising social complexity, the development of cities, and ultimately the modern world.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-10-03T12:03:31.428Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:575fbdd4fefbdf21b3893560b483c64de0563bfc","dn":"Fishing_ How the Sea Fed Civilization by Brian Fagan ePUB eBOOK-","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"575fbdd4fefbdf21b3893560b483c64de0563bfc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,95,189,212,254,251,223,33,179,137,53,96,180,131,198,77,224,86,59,252]},"name":"Fishing_ How the Sea Fed Civilization by Brian Fagan ePUB eBOOK-","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
