He is widely considered among the major authors of the 20th century in Italy.\n\nPavese moved in anti-Fascist circles and was imprisoned by the government in 1935 for his activities.  Between 1943 and 1945 he lived with partisans of the anti-Fascist Resistance in the hills of Piedmont.  After World War II Pavese joined the Italian Communist Party and worked on the party&apos;s newspaper.  The bulk of his novels and short stories were published during these years.\n\nSearchingly alert to nuances of speech, feeling, and atmosphere, and remarkably varied, his novels offer a panoramic vision, at once sensual and finely considered, of a time of tumultuous change.  Four of his major works are presented in SELECTED WORKS, in translations by R. W. Flint that were hailed by literary critic Leslie Fiedler as &quot;absolutely lucid and completely incantatory.&quot;  THE BEACH (1941) is a wry summertime comedy of sexual and romantic misunderstandings, while THE DEVIL IN THE HILLS (1948) is an engaging road novel about three young men roaming the hills in high summer who stumble on mysteries of love and death.  THE HOUSE ON THE HILL (1949) is an extraordinary novel of war in which a teacher flees through a countryside that is both beautiful and convulsed with terror.  AMONG WOMEN ONLY (1949) tells of a fashion designer who enters the affluent world she has always dreamed of, only to find herself caught up in an eerie dance of destruction.\n\nPartly through the influence of Melville, Pavese became preoccupied with myth, symbol, and archetype.  One of his most striking books is DIALOGUES WITH LEUC&#xD2; (1947), poetically written conversations about the human condition.  His last book and the novel many consider his finest, THE MOON AND THE BONFIRES (1950), is a bleak, yet compassionate story of a hero who tries to find himself and learn what happened in his native village over the long, terrible years of Fascism, and discovers that the past continues to haunt the present.  THE BURNING BRAND: DIARIES 1935-1950, published posthumously in 1952, is striking chronicle of the author&apos;s inner life.\n\n\nThe following books are in PDF format unless otherwise noted:\n\n\n                                == FICTION ==\n\n* Among Women Only (Noonday, 1959).
