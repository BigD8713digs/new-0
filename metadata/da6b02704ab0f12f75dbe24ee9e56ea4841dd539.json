Why, they wondered, would he turn down a life of relative luxury to relocate to an armed compound in a breakaway region of the world&apos;s number one failed state? To achieve his mission, Starr would have to overcome profound cultural differences, broken promises, and threats to his safety and that of his staff. It Takes a School is the story of how an abstract vision became a transformative reality, as Starr set out to build a school in a place forgotten by the world. It is the story of a skeptical and clan-based society learning to give way to trust. And it is the story of the students themselves, including a boy from a family of nomads who took off on his own in search of an education and a girl who waged a hunger strike in order to convince her strict parents to send her to Abaarso.\r\n\r\nAbaarso has placed 40 graduates and counting in American universities, from Harvard to MIT, and sends Somaliland a clear message: its children can compete with anyone in the world. Now the initial question Starr was asked demands another: &quot;If such a success can happen in an unrecognized breakaway region of Somalia, can it not happen anywhere?&quot;\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-07-11T12:00:21.048Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:da6b02704ab0f12f75dbe24ee9e56ea4841dd539","dn":"Jonathan Starr - It Takes a School 2017 RETAiL ePUB eBOOK-DiSTRi","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"da6b02704ab0f12f75dbe24ee9e56ea4841dd539","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,107,2,112,74,176,241,47,117,219,226,78,233,229,110,164,132,29,213,57]},"name":"Jonathan Starr - It Takes a School 2017 RETAiL ePUB eBOOK-DiSTRi","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
