Einstein famously quipped that God does not play dice with the universe, and Schr&#xF6;dinger is equally well known for his thought experiment about the cat in the box who ends up &quot;spread out&quot; in a probabilistic state, neither wholly alive nor wholly dead. Both of these famous images arose from these two men&apos;s dissatisfaction with quantum weirdness and with their assertion that underneath it all, there must be some essentially deterministic world. Even though it was Einstein&apos;s own theories that made quantum mechanics possible, both he and Schr&#xF6;dinger could not bear the idea that the universe was, at its most fundamental level, random. \r\n\r\nAs the Second World War raged, both men struggled to produce a theory that would describe in full the universe&apos;s ultimate design, first as collaborators, then as competitors. They both ultimately failed in their search for a grand unified theory - not only because quantum mechanics is true but because Einstein and Schr&#xF6;dinger were also missing a key component: of the four forces we recognize today (gravity, electromagnetism, the weak force, and the strong force), only gravity and electromagnetism were known at the time. \r\n\r\n..\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-12-26T12:08:13.793Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:7bd1b2f66508a127b72071917ad4185d817bdeab","dn":"Einstein's Dice and Schrodinger's Cat by Paul Halpern EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"7bd1b2f66508a127b72071917ad4185d817bdeab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,209,178,246,101,8,161,39,183,32,113,145,122,212,24,93,129,123,222,171]},"name":"Einstein's Dice and Schrodinger's Cat by Paul Halpern EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
