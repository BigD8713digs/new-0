This lightweight container system is easier to deploy and more flexible than traditional VMs. Built for simplicity and speed, it radically reduces your reliance on manual system administration for tasks like configuring servers, creating disposable (and portable!) development environments, and predictably rolling out applications on unknown systems. While the idea behind Docker is simple, it can have a major impact on how software is developed and deployed. Docker in Practice is a hands-on guide to over 100 specific techniques that can be used to get the most out of Docker. Following a cookbook-style Problem/Solution/Discussion format, this practical handbook offers instantly-useful solutions for important areas like effortless server maintenance and configuration, deploying microservices, creating safe environments for experimentation","last_updated":"2018-05-05T12:02:13.137Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e6ff311c35b372517f5588ec6aacee36fba036f","dn":"Docker in Practice.pdf","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"8e6ff311c35b372517f5588ec6aacee36fba036f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,111,243,17,195,91,55,37,23,245,88,142,198,170,206,227,111,186,3,111]},"name":"Docker in Practice.pdf","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
