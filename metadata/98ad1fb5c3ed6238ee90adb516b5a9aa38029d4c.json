A folk-rock style singer/songwriter, whose lyrics were the focus of much of his best work, he just never seemed to be that essential to take in live, which is why this 45-minute concert for German television dating from 1979 is a modest surprise. Stewart and his band not only do a fairly lively show before a studio audience, but the camera work is so mobile that the visuals never get boring. Additionally, the sound is so clean that it puts to shame some of Stewart&apos;s older CDs for quality. The performances are fresh and spirited, on material ranging from &quot;SoHo (Needless to Say)&quot; to more recent songs like &quot;Time Passages,&quot; &quot;Year of the Cat,&quot; and &quot;On the Border.&quot; If there is a flaw, it&apos;s the absence of &quot;Roads to Moscow,&quot; but considering that this performance was aimed at a German audience, that song might&apos;ve fallen on deaf (or at least unsympathetic) ears. The other drawback is that not all of Stewart&apos;s material here is that memorable -- &quot;Palace of Versailles,&quot; which runs more than five minutes, is rather tuneless, and &quot;Valentina Way&quot; isn&apos;t much better, but it does at least benefit from a nice tempo and a few decent hooks. Stewart plays a mix of acoustic and electric guitars backed by a septet that does a good job of recreating the songs&apos; original sounds in a live context. The video transfer from SECAM to NTSC does reveal some artifacting -- momentary, intermittent horizontal lines -- but it is, otherwise, extremely sharp, bright, and pleasing.\r\n\r\nScreen Ratio: 4:3\r\nAudio Track: Dolby Digital Stereo\r\nRunning Time: 45 mins\r\n\r\nTRACKS LISTING:\r\n1 On The Border\r\n2 So Ho (Needless To Say)\r\n3 Palace Of Versailles\r\n4 Valentine Way\r\n5 Year Of The Cat\r\n6 Song On The Radio","last_updated":"2017-07-26T12:03:43.940Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:98ad1fb5c3ed6238ee90adb516b5a9aa38029d4c","dn":"Al Stewart The Best Of Musikladen","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"98ad1fb5c3ed6238ee90adb516b5a9aa38029d4c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,173,31,181,195,237,98,56,238,144,173,181,22,181,169,170,56,2,157,76]},"name":"Al Stewart The Best Of Musikladen","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
