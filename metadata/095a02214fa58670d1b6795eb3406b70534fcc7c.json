It was originally released on 29 May 1995, on the label EMI in the United Kingdom and on 6 June 1995 by Columbia in the United States.[3]\r\n\r\nThe album was recorded during the band&apos;s Division Bell Tour in 1994, specifically the UK and European leg, which ran from July to October 1994.\r\nUnlike Delicate Sound of Thunder, David Gilmour and record producer James Guthrie have stated that no parts of the songs were re-recorded in the studio (James Guthrie confirmed this in an interview with Pink Floyd fanzine Brain Damage). However, the band and Guthrie fixed songs that had bad notes (as heard on some bootlegs) by lifting solos and corrected vocal lines from other performances as the band recorded most of the European leg. The CD claimed that it was mixed in &quot;Q Sound&quot; which produces a 3D audio effect even on a two channel stereo system.\r\nBut this is one of the &quot;Bootlegs&quot; Enjoy and share\r\n\r\nTracklist\r\n\r\nDisk 1\r\n01 Shine On You Crazy Diamond.mp3\r\n02 Learning To Fly.mp3\r\n03 High Hopes.mp3\r\n04 Take It Back.mp3\r\n05 Coming Back To Life.mp3\r\n06 Sorrow.mp3\r\n07 Keep Talking.mp3\r\n08 Another Brick In The Wall.mp3\r\n09 One Of These Days.mp3\r\n10 Speak To Me - Breathe.mp3\r\n11 On The Run.mp3\r\n\r\nDisk 2\r\n\r\n12 Time - Breathe.mp3\r\n13 The Great Gig In The Sky.mp3\r\n14 Money.mp3\r\n15 Us And Them.mp3\r\n16 Any Colour You Like.mp3\r\n17 Brain Damage.mp3\r\n18 Eclipse.mp3\r\n19 Wish You Were Here.mp3\r\n20 Comfortably Numb.mp3\r\n21 Run Like Hell.mp3\r\n\r\n\r\nPersonnel\r\n\r\nPink Floyd\r\n\r\nDavid Gilmour &#x2013; lead vocals, guitar\r\nNick Mason &#x2013; drums\r\nRichard Wright &#x2013; keyboards, backing vocals, lead vocals on &quot;Astronomy Domine&quot;, &quot;Time&quot;, and &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot;\r\nAdditional personnel\r\nGuy Pratt &#x2013; bass, backing vocals, co-lead vocals on &quot;Run Like Hell&quot;\r\nJon Carin &#x2013; keyboards, backing vocals, co-lead vocals on &quot;Hey You&quot;\r\nSam Brown &#x2013; backing vocals, first vocalist on &quot;The Great Gig in the Sky&quot;\r\nDurga McBroom &#x2013; backing vocals, second vocalist on &quot;The Great Gig in the Sky&quot;\r\nClaudia Fontaine &#x2013; backing vocals, third vocalist on &quot;The Great Gig in the Sky&quot;\r\nTim Renwick &#x2013; guitar, backing vocals\r\nDick Parry &#x2013; saxophone\r\nGary Wallis &#x2013; percussion","last_updated":"2018-01-28T12:10:32.203Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:095a02214fa58670d1b6795eb3406b70534fcc7c","dn":"Pink Floyd - Earls Court, London[2-CD]1994 ak","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"095a02214fa58670d1b6795eb3406b70534fcc7c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,90,2,33,79,165,134,112,209,182,121,94,179,64,107,112,83,79,204,124]},"name":"Pink Floyd - Earls Court, London[2-CD]1994 ak","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
