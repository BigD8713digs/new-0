How does a remote-controlled car move? And what makes lights on TVs and microwaves blink? The technology around you may seem like magic, but most of it wouldn&#x2019;t run without electricity.\r\n\r\nElectronics for Kids demystifies electricity with a collection of awesome hands-on projects. In Part 1, you&#x2019;ll learn how current, voltage, and circuits work by making a battery out of a lemon, turning a metal bolt into an electromagnet, and transforming a paper cup and some magnets into a spinning motor. In Part 2, you&#x2019;ll make even more cool stuff as you:\r\n&#x2013;Solder a blinking LED circuit with resistors, capacitors, and relays\r\n&#x2013;Turn a circuit into a touch sensor using your finger as a resistor\r\n&#x2013;Build an alarm clock triggered by the sunrise\r\n&#x2013;Create a musical instrument that makes sci-fi soundsThen, in Part 3, you&#x2019;ll learn about digital electronics&#x2014;things like logic gates and memory circuits&#x2014;as you make a secret code checker and an electronic coin flipper. Finally, you&#x2019;ll use everything you&#x2019;ve learned to make the LED Reaction Game&#x2014;test your reaction time as you try to catch a blinking light!With its clear explanations and assortment of hands-on projects, Electronics for Kids will have you building your own circuits in no time","last_updated":"2018-01-28T12:03:48.310Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e8f216e96b0b2cc5d20d7d8a032cb9cb521ff1a","dn":"Electronics for Kids - Play with Simple Circuits and Experiment ","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"9e8f216e96b0b2cc5d20d7d8a032cb9cb521ff1a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,143,33,110,150,176,178,204,93,32,215,216,160,50,203,156,181,33,255,26]},"name":"Electronics for Kids - Play with Simple Circuits and Experiment ","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
