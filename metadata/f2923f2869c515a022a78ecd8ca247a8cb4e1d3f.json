This book is the result of a bet between Marion and Don Wollheim, her editor for the Darkover novels at DAW Books. In addition, it&apos;s her response to the Gor novels - where men were men and women were slaves - that were also being published by DAW Books. Yes, this book does start out with a heroine who has been captured and is being sold as a slave, who has amnesia and remembers nothing of her life before the trip across the desert with the slavers - and, due to a head injury, remembers mercifully little of that. But she does know that she would rather fight in the arena than be a harlot for the men who do, and that choice changes the rest of the book. In a Gor-style novel the woman would become less her own person, eventually learning to be a contented and obedient slave. In this book, even while the heroine, called Zadieyek of Gyre, remains a slave, she is something quite different from the typical &quot;slave girl&quot; - she grows and develops, always searching for her memory and her past, convinced that this is not how her life is supposed to be. And, of course, she&apos;s right.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-04-25T12:04:01.078Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2923f2869c515a022a78ecd8ca247a8cb4e1d3f","dn":"Warrior Woman by Marion Zimmer Bradley AZW","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"f2923f2869c515a022a78ecd8ca247a8cb4e1d3f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,146,63,40,105,197,21,160,34,167,142,205,140,162,71,168,203,78,29,63]},"name":"Warrior Woman by Marion Zimmer Bradley AZW","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
