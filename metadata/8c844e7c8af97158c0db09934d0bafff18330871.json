Woefully inexperienced, they took control of a luxury game lodge where the rich and famous went to sip gin and tonics with lions and elephants.\r\n\r\nTrouble soon followed. The couple&apos;s lives were threatened daily by snakes, elephants, baboons, and a hyena with a plastic fetish. Not to mention the endless - and often insurmountable - challenge of keeping their five-star guests fed in a world where the closest supermarket was an air flight away. Among others, their guests included a famous Hollywood director, some French aristocrats, a Mafia lawyer, world-famous singers, and the England cricket captain. Lighthearted and humorous, Torn Trousers will enthrall you with its unique look at life in wild Africa.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-05-15T12:01:20.032Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c844e7c8af97158c0db09934d0bafff18330871","dn":"Torn Trousers by Andrew St. Pierre White, Gwynn White EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"8c844e7c8af97158c0db09934d0bafff18330871","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,132,78,124,138,249,113,88,192,219,9,147,77,11,175,255,24,51,8,113]},"name":"Torn Trousers by Andrew St. Pierre White, Gwynn White EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
