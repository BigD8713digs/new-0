The file is self-explanatory for the most part. It is an upscale to 720p of the original DVD. The 5.1 AC3 is 1:1 copy and the 2.0 stereo AC3 is an encode to 256 kbps. Both are 48 kHz. The 5.1 audio is the first audio track.\r\n \r\nThere are 7 subtitle languages. English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese and Japanese.  You must have your player set to on for them to show. They are only active when a band member speaks words such as &quot;Come on!&quot; that are not part of the original studio song. This is precisely the same as the original DVD.\r\n\r\nI think you will find that you enjoy this lots more than the original, due to no blocks and a just a general overall better picture.\r\n\r\nThe MPEG-4 and AC3 files are fully compliant for game consoles. You can remux to m2ts using TSMuxer or use something like Serviio with transcode on (because of .mkv container, it is necessary.)\r\n\r\nThere are chapters and they are named to the song.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy and please seed!","last_updated":"2017-11-04T12:00:39.867Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef2f9819afa37404a8ee75605dbcd81488a1fe05","dn":"Dream Theater Score (Radio City Music Hall 720p Upscaled)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"ef2f9819afa37404a8ee75605dbcd81488a1fe05","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,47,152,25,175,163,116,4,168,238,117,96,93,188,216,20,136,161,254,5]},"name":"Dream Theater Score (Radio City Music Hall 720p Upscaled)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
