Conrad convincingly invents an entire country, Costaguana, and sets it afire as warlords compete for power and a fortune in silver.\r\n\r\nSe&#xF1;or Gould, adamant that his silver should not become spoil for his enemies, entrusts it to his faithful longshoreman, Nostromo, a local hero of sorts whom Se&#xF1;or Gould believes to be incorruptible. Nostromo accepts the mission as an opportunity to increase his own fame. But when his exploit fails to win him the rewards he had hoped for, he is consumed by a corrupting resentment.\r\n\r\nNostromo, relevant both as literature and as a brilliant social study, ambitiously brings to life Latin American history and the politics of an underdeveloped country","last_updated":"2017-06-26T12:01:49.515Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:43cf5aca018aaec793a9cf3fa8f42a95e980c591","dn":"Nostromo by Joseph Conrad epub RtR","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"43cf5aca018aaec793a9cf3fa8f42a95e980c591","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,207,90,202,1,138,174,199,147,169,207,63,168,244,42,149,233,128,197,145]},"name":"Nostromo by Joseph Conrad epub RtR","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
