Actually we&apos;re all playing games. Forty years ago, Games People Play revolutionized our understanding of what really goes on during basic social interactions. More than five million copies later, Dr. Eric Berne&apos;s classic is as astonishing &amp; revealing as it was on the day it was first published. \r\nWe play games all the time: sexual games, marital games, power games with our bosses, &amp; competitive games with friends. Detailing status contests like &quot;Martini&quot;; (I know a better way), to lethal couples combat like &quot;If It Weren&apos;t For You&quot;; &amp; &quot;Uproar,&quot;; to flirtation favorites like &quot;The Stocking Game&quot;; &amp; &quot;Let&apos;s You &amp; Him Fight,&quot;; Berne exposes the secret ploys &amp; unconscious maneuvers that rule our intimate lives. Explosive when it first appeared, Games People Play is now widely recognized as the most original &amp; influential popular psychology book of our time. It&apos;s as powerful &amp; eye-opening as ever","last_updated":"2018-06-07T12:07:55.008Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:14581126084474209795d9d714242f4b5c9088a7","dn":"Games People Play - Eric Berne (1964) (Epub)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"14581126084474209795d9d714242f4b5c9088a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,88,17,38,8,68,116,32,151,149,217,215,20,36,47,75,92,144,136,167]},"name":"Games People Play - Eric Berne (1964) (Epub)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
