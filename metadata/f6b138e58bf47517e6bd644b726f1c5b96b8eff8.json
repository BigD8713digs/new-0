Long-standing nautical traditions of the evening are extended in Stanford&apos;s Songs of the Sea, featuring Canadian baritone Gerald Finley. The centenary of the end of the Great War is marked with a new work from Roxanna Panufnik, which also rounds off the season&apos;s original premieres and features BBC Singers and BBC Symphony Chorus.\r\nThe evening includes music by Hindemith, Berlioz and Charles Hubert Parry, who is celebrated 100 years after his death with a performance of Blest Pair of Sirens.
