They have the right to be. In the Black feminist tradition of Audre Lorde, Brittney Cooper reminds us that anger is a powerful source of energy that can give us the strength to keep on fighting. \r\n\r\nFar too often, Black women&apos;s anger has been caricatured into an ugly and destructive force that threatens the civility and social fabric of American democracy. But Cooper shows us that there is more to the story than that. Black women&apos;s eloquent rage is what makes Serena Williams such a powerful tennis player. It&apos;s what makes Beyonc&#xE9;&apos;s girl power anthems resonate so hard. It&apos;s what makes Michelle Obama an icon. Eloquent rage keeps us all honest and accountable. It reminds women that they don&apos;t have to settle for less. \r\n\r\nWhen Cooper learned of her grandmother&apos;s eloquent rage about love, sex, and marriage in an epic and hilarious front-porch confrontation, her life was changed. And it took another intervention, this time staged by one of her homegirls, to turn Brittney into the fierce feminist she is today. In Brittney Cooper&apos;s world, neither mean girls nor f--kboys ever win. But homegirls emerge as heroes. This book argues that ultimately feminism, friendship, and faith in one&apos;s own superpowers are all we really need to turn things right side up again. \r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-04-26T12:06:26.552Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ca689ecc396ff73ab633d141d689201d6c30f1e","dn":"Eloquent Rage by Brittney Cooper EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"7ca689ecc396ff73ab633d141d689201d6c30f1e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,166,137,236,195,150,255,115,171,99,61,20,29,104,146,1,214,195,15,30]},"name":"Eloquent Rage by Brittney Cooper EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
