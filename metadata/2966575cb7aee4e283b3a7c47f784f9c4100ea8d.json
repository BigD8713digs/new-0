With features like multi-caret editing, column/block editing and multi-select, it&apos;s a simple text editor when you want it to be, and a multi-cursor power editor when you need it to be.\n\n\nThemes\nChoose one of our core themes or try our beautiful user-contributed themes to get UltraEdit looking exactly how you&apos;d like it to. Take it a step further by modifying your theme or creating a new one from scratch, then contribute it back for the rest of our users to enjoy.\n\n\nMulti-caret/multi-select\nUltraEdit features the most powerful and intuitive multi-caret editing and multi-selection capabilites in the business. Once your cursors or selections are where you want them to be, you can copy, cut, paste, select and delete just the same as you normally would.\n\n\nSearch\nIf it can be searched for, UltraEdit will find it. But search is almost the wrong word. With the power to search with regular expressions, search across files, find a needle in a 4GB haystack, or just quickly find a word you&apos;re looking for, this isn&apos;t search. This is omniscience.\n\n\nColumn Mode\nWhen editing horizontally just isn&apos;t quite good enough, Column Mode is there for you. Use Column Mode to intuitively edit along the Y axis anywhere in your document. It&apos;s just one of the many powerful ways UltraEdit helps you edit tabular data or code files.\n\n\nIntegrated FTP, SSH &amp; Telnet\nWhether you need to make quick edits to a file on a server or upload a massive codebase, UltraEdit&apos;s integrated FTP capabilities and SSH/Telnet make it easy to work with remote files and interact with servers from a single, powerful application.\n\nCustomizable UI\nOur menu system has been rebuilt from the ground up to make it even more customizable than ever. Our deeply customizable new menu can be laid out however you&apos;d like. Set yourself up with Ribbon mode for a familiar look and feel. Or maybe you prefer the simple toolbar with only your most commonly needed features. The possibilities are endless.\n\nEdit large files\nUltraEdit is built to edit the large files that causes other text editors to crash. People who deal with databases and large log files absolutely love our product for this very reason.\n\n4k UHD support\nUltraEdit looks great on Retina and other ultra high-definition displays. If you haven&apos;t upgraded yet, no need to worry. We&apos;ll be ready for you when you do.\n\nMulti-platform\nUltraEdit is available for Windows, Mac and Linux. Even if you&apos;ve got one of those distros nobody&apos;s heard of, there&apos;s a good chance we may be able to help you.\n\n3 for 1 licenses\nYour personal UltraEdit license is good for up to 3 machines on any combination of platforms. Want to run on two Macs and a Windows box? You&apos;re all set!\n\nOfficial Website: https://www.ultraedit.com/","last_updated":"2017-06-25T12:05:17.675Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:2966575cb7aee4e283b3a7c47f784f9c4100ea8d","dn":"IDM UltraEdit v24.10.0.24 x64","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"2966575cb7aee4e283b3a7c47f784f9c4100ea8d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,102,87,92,183,174,228,226,131,179,167,196,127,120,79,156,65,0,234,141]},"name":"IDM UltraEdit v24.10.0.24 x64","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
