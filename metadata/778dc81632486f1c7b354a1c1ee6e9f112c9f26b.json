By 1947, after two centuries of British rule, it had decreased six-fold.\r\n\r\nBeyond conquest and deception, the Empire blew rebels from cannon, massacred unarmed protesters, entrenched institutionalised racism, and caused millions to die from starvation. British imperialism justified itself as enlightened despotism for the benefit of the governed, but Shashi Tharoor takes on and demolishes this position, demonstrating how every supposed imperial &apos;gift&apos; from the railways to the rule of law was designed in Britain&apos;s interests alone. He goes on to show how Britain&apos;s Industrial Revolution was founded on India&apos;s deindustrialisation, and the destruction of its textile industry.\r\n\r\nIn this bold and incisive reassessment of colonialism, Tharoor exposes to devastating effect the inglorious reality of Britain&apos;s stained Indian legacy.\r\n\r\nHardcover: 288 pages\r\nPublisher: C Hurst &amp; Co Publishers Ltd (2 Mar. 2017)","last_updated":"2017-09-03T12:02:26.582Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:778dc81632486f1c7b354a1c1ee6e9f112c9f26b","dn":"Inglorious Empire: What the British Did to India","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"778dc81632486f1c7b354a1c1ee6e9f112c9f26b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,141,200,22,50,72,111,28,123,53,74,28,30,230,233,241,18,201,242,107]},"name":"Inglorious Empire: What the British Did to India","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
