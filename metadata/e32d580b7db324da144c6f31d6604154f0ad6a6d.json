Convolutional neural networks are one of the most successful deep learning approaches: self-driving cars rely heavily on this algorithm. First you will learn about densly connected neural networks and its problems. The next chapter are about convolutional neural networks: theory as well as implementation in Java with the deeplearning4j library. The last chapters are about recurrent neural networks and the applications!\r\nWho is the target audience?\r\n\r\n    Anyone who wants to understand deep learning and convolutional neural networks in Java\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n\r\n    Some math (derivatives and matrix operations)\r\n    Java basics (classes, objects etc.)\r\n\r\nLast updated 3/2018","last_updated":"2018-10-22T12:02:59.547Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:e32d580b7db324da144c6f31d6604154f0ad6a6d","dn":"Udemy - Artificial Intelligence III - Deep Learning in Java","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"e32d580b7db324da144c6f31d6604154f0ad6a6d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,45,88,11,125,179,36,218,20,76,111,49,214,96,65,84,240,173,106,109]},"name":"Udemy - Artificial Intelligence III - Deep Learning in Java","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
