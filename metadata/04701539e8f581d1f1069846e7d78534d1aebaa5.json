His goal, he claims, is for the government to recognize the parts as people and to give them proper burial. But when the corpse goes missing, a wave of eerie murders sweeps the city, and reports stream in of a horrendous-looking criminal who, though shot, cannot be killed.\r\n\r\nHadi soon realizes he&apos;s created a monster, one that needs human flesh to survive - first from the guilty, and then from anyone in its path. A prizewinning novel by &quot;Baghdad&apos;s new literary star&quot; (The New York Times), Frankenstein in Baghdad captures with white-knuckle horror and black humor the surreal reality of contemporary Iraq.\r\n\r\nWinner of the International Prize for Arabic Fiction\r\n\r\nWinner of France&apos;s Grand Prize for Fantasy\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-01-26T12:05:06.935Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:04701539e8f581d1f1069846e7d78534d1aebaa5","dn":"Frankenstein in Baghdad by Ahmed Saadawi EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"04701539e8f581d1f1069846e7d78534d1aebaa5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,112,21,57,232,245,129,209,241,6,152,70,231,215,133,52,209,174,186,165]},"name":"Frankenstein in Baghdad by Ahmed Saadawi EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
