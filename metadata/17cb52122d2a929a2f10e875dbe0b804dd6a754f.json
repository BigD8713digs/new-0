Returning with their first new album since 2014, it sees them travel even further into the electronic pulses of synths and beats while retaining the dreamy, psychedelic vibes. \r\nThis band sure know how to create melodies. Huge and swirling sounds build from the moment this record starts and just keep going from beginning to end. The dramatic beats and twists on tracks such as &#x2018;All You Sad Boys&#x2019; are phenomenal and just grab your attention from the moment they begin. Spacey and filled with dreamy landscapes, this record has the perfect title, just listen to &#x2018;Melodista&#x2019; as proof of this. The blending of male and female vocals on this record is so slickly done throughout this record. This duo harmonise together so well on Saturn Days, in particular on tracks such as &#x2018;Crash&#x2019; where the vocals sound superb and with writing this intriguing and thoughtful, this is all something to behold as this record continues on. Sha Sabi&#x2019;s vocals working in the background in particular are striking and add delicate notes to dark melodies. \r\nA unique and ethereal record that keeps giving until the very end, Saturn Days is an almighty album. Powerful melodies that can only be crafted with the expertise of this pair, United Ghosts return with a fabulous collection of songs. \r\n\r\nTracklist: \r\n01. Waves.flac \r\n02.
