At home, they&apos;re the stereotypical parents of stereotypical kids; at work, they pose as travel agents; but at night, they weave a web of confidants, lovers, dupes, and historical figures from the Reagan-era Cold War. The startlingly realistic plot twists force the viewer to consider the real cost of an undeclared war, what it takes to protect one&apos;s beliefs, if it&apos;s worth it, and if it actually worked for either side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGame of Thrones S07E01:&#xA0;Dragonstone:&#xA0;Jon organizes the defense of the North. Cersei tries to even the odds.
