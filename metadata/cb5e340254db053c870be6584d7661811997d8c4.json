Constant quality RF = 22.50 was used unless the resulting encode was too large (over 7000kbps) or too small (under 3500kbps). In those cases the RF was adjusted so the encode was just within the desired range of 3500kbps-7000kbps. The audio was sourced from DTS-HD 5.1 and the subtitles are passthrough from the BluRay (i.e. no OCR). The subtitles are italics for riffing and they note who is riffing - Jonah, Crow, or Tom - and if they are speaking or singing.\r\n\r\nThe following logos were removed or shortened so when playing an episode it immediately starts with an SOL establishing shot. After the stinger scene at the end of the episode, 3.5seconds of the silent Satellite of Love LLC logo is shown and then the episode ends. The documentary was fully encoded including the opening and closing logo. Including some removed beginning and ending black frames, the total change in time is about 17-18seconds less for each episode compared to the BluRay.\r\n\r\nOpening logo:\r\n*Netflix(open) ~5sec - completely removed\r\n\r\nClosing logos:\r\n* Satellite of Love LLC ~4.0sec - shortened by ~0.5sec\r\n* Abominable Pictures ~1.9sec - completely removed\r\n* Shout Factory ~4.0sec - completely removed\r\n* Netflix(close) ~5.3sec - completely removed\r\n\r\nPlease check out other shares of MST3K, Cinematic Titanic, The Film Crew, Rifftrax, Battlestar Galactica, DC Comics, Gotham, Star Trek, Star Wars, audiobooks, documentaries, music and more at your favorite sharing sites.\r\nThanks","last_updated":"2018-06-29T12:01:11.269Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb5e340254db053c870be6584d7661811997d8c4","dn":"Mystery Science Theater 3000 MST3K Season11 s11 BluRay AVC AC3","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"cb5e340254db053c870be6584d7661811997d8c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,94,52,2,84,219,5,60,135,11,230,88,77,118,97,129,25,151,216,196]},"name":"Mystery Science Theater 3000 MST3K Season11 s11 BluRay AVC AC3","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
