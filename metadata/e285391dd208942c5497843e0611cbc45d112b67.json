Borger recounts how Radovan Karad&#x17E;ic and Ratko Mladic - both now on trial in The Hague - were finally tracked down and describes the intrigue behind the arrest of Slobodan Milosevic, the Yugoslav president who became the first head of state to stand before an international tribunal for crimes perpetrated in a time of war.\r\n\r\nBased on interviews with former special forces soldiers, intelligence officials, and investigators from a dozen countries - most speaking about their involvement for the first time - this book reconstructs a 14-year manhunt carried out almost entirely in secret. Indicting the worst war criminals that Europe had known since the Nazi era, the ICTY ultimately accounted for all 161 suspects on its wanted list, a feat never before achieved in political and military history.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-08-30T12:09:34.917Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:e285391dd208942c5497843e0611cbc45d112b67","dn":"The Butcher's Trail_ How the Search for Balkan War Criminals Bec","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"e285391dd208942c5497843e0611cbc45d112b67","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,133,57,29,210,8,148,44,84,151,132,62,6,17,203,196,93,17,43,103]},"name":"The Butcher's Trail_ How the Search for Balkan War Criminals Bec","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
