Alicia, an official tour guide, assures David Cole, on camera, that the &quot;gas chamber&quot; in the main camp that is shown to visitors is in its original, unaltered state. Then Dr. Franciszek Piper, head curator of the Auschwitz State Museum, acknowledges to Cole that this &quot;gas chamber&quot; is actually a postwar creation. This video also tackles other Holocaust claims, including the &quot;human soap&quot; fable. This video affirms what French scholar Dr. Robert Faurisson had already established, and what Holocaust skeptics had maintained for years: that fraudulent &quot;proofs&quot; of homicidal gassings were produced after the end of World War II, and that visitors to the Auschwitz camp site have been systematically deceived for decades. British historian David Irving was fined 10,000 marks by a German court, and banned from Germany, for having said what Dr. Piper casually acknowledges here. Defenders of the orthodox Holocaust story were understandably rattled by this video. Jewish groups sought to ban newspaper advertisements for it. Prof. Yehuda Bauer, a prominent Israeli Holocaust specialist, called it &quot;a powerful and dangerous video.&quot;\r\n\r\nPlease share this information far and wide, burn the video to DVDs or put it on USB thumbdrives and give them out to friends, family and others.\r\n\r\nPlease seed as long as possible, at least to a ratio of 1.100, thank you :)\r\n\r\nGeneral           : David Cole Interviews Dr. Franciszek Piper.mp4\r\nFormat            : MPEG-4 at 366 kb/s\r\nLength            : 168 MiB for 1 h 4 min 14 s 258 ms\r\n\r\nVideo #0          : AVC at 235 kb/s\r\nAspect            : 320 x 240 (1.333) at 25.000 fps\r\n\r\nAudio #0          : AAC at 126 kb/s\r\nInfos             : 2 channels, 44.1 kHz\r\n\r\nScreens: <a href=\"\nhttps://s19.postimg.cc/hde2atk0z/vlcsnap-2018-07-14-01h40m10s127.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://s19.postimg.cc/hde2atk0z/vlcsnap-2018-07-14-01h40m10s127.png</a> <a href=\"\nhttps://s19.postimg.cc/i2wun6sab/vlcsnap-2018-07-14-01h40m21s531.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://s19.postimg.cc/i2wun6sab/vlcsnap-2018-07-14-01h40m21s531.png</a> <a href=\"\nhttps://s19.postimg.cc/8id80bidv/vlcsnap-2018-07-14-01h40m28s536.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://s19.postimg.cc/8id80bidv/vlcsnap-2018-07-14-01h40m28s536.png</a> <a href=\"\nhttps://s19.postimg.cc/oglxqeulf/vlcsnap-2018-07-14-01h41m11s743.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://s19.postimg.cc/oglxqeulf/vlcsnap-2018-07-14-01h41m11s743.png</a> <a href=\"\nhttps://s19.postimg.cc/h0mo4melv/vlcsnap-2018-07-14-01h41m57s938.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://s19.postimg.cc/h0mo4melv/vlcsnap-2018-07-14-01h41m57s938.png</a> <a href=\"\nhttps://s19.postimg.cc/rap33vjwz/vlcsnap-2018-07-14-01h42m11s210.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://s19.postimg.cc/rap33vjwz/vlcsnap-2018-07-14-01h42m11s210.png</a>","last_updated":"2018-07-14T12:09:15.302Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:398cad517bfb5a69f6a5f02058f3144d4d23538c","dn":"David Cole Interviews Dr. Franciszek Piper (1992)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"398cad517bfb5a69f6a5f02058f3144d4d23538c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,140,173,81,123,251,90,105,246,165,240,32,88,243,20,77,77,35,83,140]},"name":"David Cole Interviews Dr. Franciszek Piper (1992)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
