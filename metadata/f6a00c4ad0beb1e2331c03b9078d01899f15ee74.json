When he couldn&apos;t pry money for his jail from the city treasury, he organized a rock concert benefit for the jail. He got a taste of prison life from the other side of the bars, serving five days in San Mateo County Jail (not his own) for defying a court order to evict tenants.\r\n\r\nSince taking office, Sheriff Hongisto has built a playground for the children of jail visitors, started a venereal disease treatment program, ended censorship of prisoner mail and named an ombudsman to handle inmate and staff complaints. &#xA0;Supervisor John Barbagelata says Our sheriff is an outright revolutionary,&#x201D; the supervisor continued, &#x201C;He&apos;s a dangerous man.&#x201D; &#xA0; &#xA0;Sounds kinda cool for a Cop huh?\r\nSo Im posting this Show that was mentioned. .He was progressive thats a winner by me.and makes him worthy of note. After All he convinced Crosby,Nash and Young so theres that\r\nAlright Enough...\r\n\r\nTracklist\r\n.01 Wooden Ships\r\n02 I Used To Be A King\r\n03 Lee Shore\r\n04 Harvest\r\n05 Only Love Can Break Your Heart\r\n06 talk about prison benefi\r\n07 Southbound Train\r\n08 talk intro to Crosby solo segment.\r\n09 Almost Cut My Hair\r\n10 Page 43\r\n11 talk intro to Nash solo segment\r\n12 And So It Goes\r\n13 Immigration Man\r\n14 Heart Of Gold\r\n15 Needle And The Damage Done\r\n16 KSAN announcer + talk about Prison Benefit\r\n17 Teach Your Children\r\n18 Military Madness\r\n19 Chicago\r\n20 talk Bill Graham outro","last_updated":"2018-11-05T12:18:25.054Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6a00c4ad0beb1e2331c03b9078d01899f15ee74","dn":"Crosby, Nash and Neil Young - Hongisto Benefit,Winterland 1972 a","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"f6a00c4ad0beb1e2331c03b9078d01899f15ee74","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,160,12,74,208,190,177,226,51,28,3,185,7,141,1,137,159,21,238,116]},"name":"Crosby, Nash and Neil Young - Hongisto Benefit,Winterland 1972 a","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
