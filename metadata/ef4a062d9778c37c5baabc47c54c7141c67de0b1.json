The powers that be don&#x2019;t care about the people who died, they only care about their bottom line.\r\n\r\nSilicon valley doesn&#x2019;t want any competition, they want to maintain their monopoly. When given the choice between free speech and restricted speech people will flock to the free platform.\rand Twitter began banning people randomly sometimes with no reason given, so people flocked to free speech platforms , like Vk, minds, Gab, now they&apos;re trying to ban that too leaving no place to go.\r\n\r\nWill there be no vestige of free speech on the internet?\r\n\r\nGeneral           : The Censorship of Free Speech Platform Gab sets a Dangerous Precedent.mp4\r\nFormat            : MPEG-4 at 425 kb/s\r\nLength            : 7.10 MiB for 2 min 20 s 226 ms\r\n\r\nVideo #0          : AVC at 289 kb/s\r\nAspect            : 854 x 480 (1.779) at 30.000 fps\r\n\r\nAudio #0          : AAC at 128 kb/s\r\nInfos             : 2 channels, 44.1 kHz\r\nLanguage          : en\r\n\r\nScreens: <a href=\"\nhttps://extraimage.net/images/2018/10/30/368279119d2e117d9e1f968cf21a2df8.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://extraimage.net/images/2018/10/30/368279119d2e117d9e1f968cf21a2df8.png</a> <a href=\"\nhttps://extraimage.net/images/2018/10/30/9fed2ec6906e4d365bf3a5a58f2adc3d.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://extraimage.net/images/2018/10/30/9fed2ec6906e4d365bf3a5a58f2adc3d.png</a> <a href=\"\nhttps://extraimage.net/images/2018/10/30/121c450ef41b840b014dda410aaac5ee.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://extraimage.net/images/2018/10/30/121c450ef41b840b014dda410aaac5ee.png</a>","last_updated":"2018-10-30T12:44:41.796Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef4a062d9778c37c5baabc47c54c7141c67de0b1","dn":"The Censorship of Free Speech Platform Gab sets a Dangerous Prec","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"ef4a062d9778c37c5baabc47c54c7141c67de0b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,74,6,45,151,120,195,124,91,170,188,71,197,76,113,65,198,125,224,177]},"name":"The Censorship of Free Speech Platform Gab sets a Dangerous Prec","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
