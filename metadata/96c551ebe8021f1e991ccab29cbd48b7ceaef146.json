You&apos;ll read advice on coping with adversity, reflections on happiness and the good life and powerful personal testimonies of putting Stoicism into practise. But you&apos;ll also read about the links between Stoicism and psychotherapy, Stoicism and mindfulness meditation and the unexpected places Stoicism can pop up in modern culture. This book will be of interest to both academics and non-academics alike and is about the varied ways in which the 2,300 year old philosophy as a way of life remains relevant to the concerns and needs of the present day. \r\n\r\nThe Stoicism Today project is comprised of a team of psychotherapists and academics working together to create modern-day resources for practising Stoicism, the classical philosophy as a way of life first practised over 2,300 years ago in Greece and Rome. The project had led to four international Stoic Weeks (November 2012-2015), the last of which was followed by over 3,000 people worldwide.
