It&apos;s not merely a turn of phrase. Two months after U2 unleashed Songs of Innocence on the world, Bono injured himself in a bicycle accident so severe he suspected he may never play guitar again. He recovered, but his misfortune derailed plans for the band to wrap up Songs of Experience swiftly, so U2 decided to take their time. A version of the record neared completion in 2016, but that year&apos;s twin elections of Brexit and Trump spurred U2 to revise the album, as they decided they couldn&apos;t release a record that didn&apos;t address such cataclysmic political events. Retro-conning the existing Songs of Experience material to suit the political climate wasn&apos;t the easiest task and the album often shows its seams, particularly when Bono decides to tackle the crisis head-on: the line &quot;Democracy is flat on its back, Jack&quot; arrives with a thud on &quot;The Blackout,&quot; but it&apos;s nothing compared to &quot;American Soul,&quot; an ode to real America where the singer and the band engage in a battle of hams. Here, U2 feel trapped between their history and the pull of the year, and they wind up seeming diminished. For the first time, they seem smaller than life","last_updated":"2017-12-04T12:04:56.808Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c7f1f765862897742c6baf57c999e06fd01aa51","dn":"U2 - Songs Of Experience (Deluxe) (2017) [24.96 FLAC]","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"2c7f1f765862897742c6baf57c999e06fd01aa51","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,127,31,118,88,98,137,119,66,198,186,245,124,153,158,6,253,1,170,81]},"name":"U2 - Songs Of Experience (Deluxe) (2017) [24.96 FLAC]","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
