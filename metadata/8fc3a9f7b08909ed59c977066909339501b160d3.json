And who knew that Heinrich Himmler, Tutankhamun and the history of needlework are linked to napalm and Victorian orphans?\r\nHistories of the Unexpected not only presents a new way of thinking about the past, but also reveals the everyday world around us as never before.\r\n\r\nGenre: Non-Fiction &gt; History","last_updated":"2018-10-06T12:29:47.630Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:8fc3a9f7b08909ed59c977066909339501b160d3","dn":"Histories of the Unexpected by Sam Willis (.epub)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"8fc3a9f7b08909ed59c977066909339501b160d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,195,169,247,176,137,9,237,89,201,119,6,105,9,51,149,1,177,96,211]},"name":"Histories of the Unexpected by Sam Willis (.epub)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
