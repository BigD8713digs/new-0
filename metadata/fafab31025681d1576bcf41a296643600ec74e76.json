Now in its fifth edition, the book has been comprehensively rewritten and updated whilst maintaining the clarity of its predecessors. Two new chapters discuss `in vivo` and `dietary` antioxidants, the first emphasising the role of peroxiredoxins and integrated defence mechanisms which allow useful roles for ROS, and the second containing new information on the role of fruits, vegetables, and vitamins in health and disease. This new edition also contains expanded coverage of the mechanisms of oxidative damage to lipids, DNA, and proteins (and the repair of such damage), and the roles played by reactive species in signal transduction, cell survival, death, human reproduction, defence mechanisms of animals and plants against pathogens, and other important biological events. \r\n\r\n---\r\n <a href=\"\nhttp://dlfeb.com/book/free-radicals-in-biology-and-medicine/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttp://dlfeb.com/book/free-radicals-in-biology-and-medicine/</a>","last_updated":"2017-07-23T12:01:10.199Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:fafab31025681d1576bcf41a296643600ec74e76","dn":"FREE RADICALS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"fafab31025681d1576bcf41a296643600ec74e76","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,250,179,16,37,104,29,21,118,188,244,26,41,102,67,96,14,199,78,118]},"name":"FREE RADICALS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
