His intimate firsthand account provides an affectionate, if not always uncritical, insight into this complex, troubled, but ultimately deeply fascinating woman.\r\n\r\nPacked with anecdotes - and now revised with a new chapter containing material about Diana&apos;s so-called &apos;rock&apos;, her butler, Paul Burrell - this extraordinary account is the most intimate portrait of Diana to date and a record of the events that unfolded around her during the most crucial period of her life.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-09-07T12:01:59.030Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:a91e1844554a3813f372d139f60e536c21251d9a","dn":"Diana_ Closely Guarded Secret by Ken Wharfe ePUB eBOOK-ZAK","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"a91e1844554a3813f372d139f60e536c21251d9a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,30,24,68,85,74,56,19,243,114,209,57,246,14,83,108,33,37,29,154]},"name":"Diana_ Closely Guarded Secret by Ken Wharfe ePUB eBOOK-ZAK","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
