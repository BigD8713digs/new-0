We are convinced that you will soon get familiar with the many options of this universal tool for finding files of all types, wherever they may hide on your computer or in your network.\r\n\r\nFind-it will find any file, anywhere on your disc or the entire network - with any criteria you give. Above all: it scans files for their content. You may even look up files containing multiple phrases in any desired logical combination using logical operators (and / or / not). Find-it will find contents in almost any file format, even when packed within a ZIP, CAB or mail attachements and (using a remote controlled freeware tool) even PDF. Find-it only has to pass on full text retrieval inside bitmaps (i.e. scanned documents) mails contained in client databases and some file formats using unicode.\r\n\r\nFinding files by their content, at ligthning speed, without prior indexing! The tool will crawl through your directories or drives with high speed. If you have 20 GB of data and look for any file created within the last month, containing a special combination of phrases, it will be found within less than a minute. If you are able to apply further astrictions (i.e: type of file) the scan may even be finished within seconds. Even if you really have to scan all files withount any astriction like date or type even on a mediocre computer Find-it will process more than 500 Megabytes of Data per Minute.\r\n\r\nLists of found files are presented as virtual folder, looking similar to the Windows Explorer. Found files may be copied, moved, run, viewed, zipped and handled any way you want to handle them. Lists of found files can be stored for further use. Queries can be stored and repeated any time you want. Lists of found files may be searched for other criteria, exported to html or plain text&#x2026;. there is merely nothing you can&apos;t do","last_updated":"2018-07-11T12:01:54.119Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f3f1950b65e740ab6b4792a55b54529eaff13d2","dn":"Find-it 5.3 Beta 3   KeyGen","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"2f3f1950b65e740ab6b4792a55b54529eaff13d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,63,25,80,182,94,116,10,182,180,121,42,85,181,69,41,234,255,19,210]},"name":"Find-it 5.3 Beta 3   KeyGen","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
