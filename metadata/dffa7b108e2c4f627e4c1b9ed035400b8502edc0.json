Drawn from a trove of rare archival footage, audio recordings, and interviews (including Simone&apos;s remarkable private diaries), this nuanced examination of Nina Simone&apos;s life highlights her musical inventiveness and unwavering quest for equality while laying bare the personal demons that plagued her from the time of her Jim Crow childhood in North Carolina to her self-imposed exile in Liberia and Paris later in life.\r\n\r\nHarnessing the singular voice of Miss Simone herself and incorporating candid reflections from those who knew her best, including her only daughter, Light brings us face to face with a legend, examining the very public persona and very private struggles of one of our greatest artists.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-02-05T12:03:09.952Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:dffa7b108e2c4f627e4c1b9ed035400b8502edc0","dn":"What Happened, Miss Simone by Alan Light EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"dffa7b108e2c4f627e4c1b9ed035400b8502edc0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,250,123,16,142,44,79,98,126,76,27,158,208,53,64,11,133,2,237,192]},"name":"What Happened, Miss Simone by Alan Light EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
