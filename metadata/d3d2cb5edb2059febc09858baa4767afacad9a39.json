In this perilous and shocking campaign season, The New York Times columnist traces the psychologies and pathologies in one of the nastiest and most significant battles of the sexes ever. Dowd has covered Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton since the &apos;90s. She was with the real estate mogul when he shyly approached his first Presidential rope line in 1999, and she won a Pulitzer Prize that same year for her penetrating columns on the Clinton impeachment follies. Like her best-sellers, Bushworld and Are Men Necessary?, The Year of Voting Dangerously will feature Dowd&apos;s trademark cocktail of wry humor and acerbic analysis in dispatches from the political madhouse. If America is on the escalator to hell, then The Year of Voting Dangerously is the perfect guide for this surreal, insane ride","last_updated":"2017-06-10T12:00:54.429Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3d2cb5edb2059febc09858baa4767afacad9a39","dn":"Maureen Dowd - The Year of Voting Dangerously 2016 RETAiL ePUB e","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"d3d2cb5edb2059febc09858baa4767afacad9a39","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,210,203,94,219,32,89,254,188,9,133,139,170,71,103,175,172,173,154,57]},"name":"Maureen Dowd - The Year of Voting Dangerously 2016 RETAiL ePUB e","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
