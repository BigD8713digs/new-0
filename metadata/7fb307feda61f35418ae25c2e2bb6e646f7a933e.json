Believe me, I&apos;ve looked. The Hebrew subtitles are hardcoded into the video unfortunately. You can find episode 1 with English subtitles on YouTube.\r\n\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\nShababnikim, features a group of four Haredi students who study at a yeshiva in Jerusalem. One of them, Gedalya, is on the straight and narrow, while the other three prefer their Talmud study with a side of hanging out in the park, shopping at the mall and general goofing off. Shababnik is a Hebrew slang word for a Haredi youth who is off the path - but not entirely. Shababnikim don&apos;t leave the community, but stretch the limits of appropriate behavior and dilute the focus on intense study","last_updated":"2018-04-30T12:11:12.468Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:7fb307feda61f35418ae25c2e2bb6e646f7a933e","dn":"Shababnikim.S01.720p.HDTV.x264-Yonidan","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"7fb307feda61f35418ae25c2e2bb6e646f7a933e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,179,7,254,218,97,243,84,24,174,37,194,226,187,110,100,111,122,147,62]},"name":"Shababnikim.S01.720p.HDTV.x264-Yonidan","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
