A being of great power, she has hidden herself on Earth in the guise of a meek college student. This mini-series follows the misadventures of the witch as she is tracked and hunted down by a Fetch: a sort of celestial bounty hunter. Hired by one or more of the darker gods in existence, the story combines wry humor with horror to reveal the invisible world of gods and monsters that surround us all on the mortal plane. This is a surefire hit with any fan of Gaiman&#x2019;s Sandman series or the myriad specials that have come out since that nominal work&#x2019;s completion, and as a benefit, well written by Bill Willingham, a staple writer of the Vertigo &#x201C;bullpen.&#x201D;","last_updated":"2017-12-05T12:07:28.644Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:85a40eefd8acee8929976320b85eaa71caae8976","dn":"Sandman Presents - The Thessaliad (2002)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"85a40eefd8acee8929976320b85eaa71caae8976","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,164,14,239,216,172,238,137,41,151,99,32,184,94,170,113,202,174,137,118]},"name":"Sandman Presents - The Thessaliad (2002)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
