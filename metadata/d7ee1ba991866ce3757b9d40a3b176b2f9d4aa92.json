Rick Warren will guide you through a personal 42-day spiritual journey that will transform your answer to life&apos;s most important question: What on earth am I here for? Knowing God&apos;s purpose for creating you will reduce your stress, focus your energy, simplify your decisions, giving meaning to your life, and, most important, prepare you for eternity. This recording offers a blueprint for Christian living in the 21st century-a lifestyle based on God&apos;s eternal purposes.

In the tradition of Oswald Chambers, Rick Warren offers distilled wisdom on the essence of what life is all about. Full of hope and challenge, The Purpose-Driven Life will be a classic treasured by generations to come. \r\n\r\n-- Also --\r\n\r\nDo you like oldies? Check out MaxiMusic!
