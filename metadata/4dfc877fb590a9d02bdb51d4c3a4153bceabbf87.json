The book presents in-depth reviews of basic concepts and detailed explorations of complex subjects, including classifications and practical topologies, with sample results based on an up-to-date survey of the field.\r\n\r\nPacked with case studies, this state-of-the-art handbook covers topics such as modeling, steady state, and transients as well as control, design, and testing of linear machines and drives. It includes discussion of types and applications&#x2015;from small compressors for refrigerators to MAGLEV transportation&#x2015;of linear electric machines. Additional topics include low and high speed linear induction or synchronous motors, with and without PMs, with progressive or oscillatory linear motion, from topologies through modeling, design, dynamics, and control.\r\n\r\nWith a breadth and depth of coverage not found in currently available references, this book includes formulas and methods that make it an authoritative and comprehensive resource for use in R&amp;D and testing of innovative solutions to new industrial challenges in linear electric motion/energy automatic control","last_updated":"2018-08-16T12:02:30.344Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:4dfc877fb590a9d02bdb51d4c3a4153bceabbf87","dn":"Linear Electric Machines, Drives, and MAGLEVs Handbook (PDF)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"4dfc877fb590a9d02bdb51d4c3a4153bceabbf87","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,252,135,127,181,144,169,208,43,219,81,212,195,164,21,59,206,171,191,135]},"name":"Linear Electric Machines, Drives, and MAGLEVs Handbook (PDF)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
