Toxicology is the study of poisons, and this series details the study of the molecular basis by which a vast array of agents encountered in the human environment and produced by the human body itself manifest themselves as toxins. Not strictly limited to documenting these examples, the series is also concerned with the complex web of chemical and biological events that give rise to toxin-induced symptoms and disease. The new technologies that are being harnessed to analyze and understand these events will also be reviewed by leading workers in the field","last_updated":"2018-07-08T12:10:18.670Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:4b9921e92d3f27c2ef707dd179664dd7d05cdf9d","dn":"Advances in Molecular Toxicology: Vol.8","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"4b9921e92d3f27c2ef707dd179664dd7d05cdf9d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,153,33,233,45,63,39,194,239,112,125,209,121,102,77,215,208,92,223,157]},"name":"Advances in Molecular Toxicology: Vol.8","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
