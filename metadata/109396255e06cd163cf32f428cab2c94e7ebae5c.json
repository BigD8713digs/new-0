After a 51-day standoff, the conflict ends when an FBI assault leads to a fire that engulfs the compound, killing 76 Branch Davidians, including Koresh. Told from the perspectives of those who were there, including chief FBI negotiator Gary Noesner and survivor David Thibodeau, the six-part scripted series &quot;Waco&quot; dramatizes one of the most misunderstood stories in American history","last_updated":"2018-02-08T12:12:36.420Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:109396255e06cd163cf32f428cab2c94e7ebae5c","dn":"Waco.S01E03.720p.HDTV.x264.[370MB]","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"109396255e06cd163cf32f428cab2c94e7ebae5c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,147,150,37,94,6,205,22,60,243,47,66,140,171,44,148,231,235,174,92]},"name":"Waco.S01E03.720p.HDTV.x264.[370MB]","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
