Now pilots are the heroes of what&apos;s left of the human race, and becoming one has always been Spensa&apos;s dream. Since she was a little girl, she has imagined soaring skyward and proving her bravery. But her fate is intertwined with her father&apos;s--a pilot himself who was killed years ago when he abruptly deserted his team, leaving Spensa&apos;s chances of attending flight school at slim to none.\r\n\r\nNo one will let Spensa forget what her father did, yet fate works in mysterious ways. Flight school might be a long shot, but she is determined to fly. And an accidental discovery in a long-forgotten cavern might just provide her with a way to claim the stars.\r\n\r\nGenre: Fiction &gt; Sci-Fi/Fantasy","last_updated":"2018-11-07T12:21:41.674Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:eeae33c9f9bd216459a6f5a19b36d42c7fb70313","dn":"Skyward (Skyward #1) by Brandon Sanderson (.epub)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"eeae33c9f9bd216459a6f5a19b36d42c7fb70313","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,174,51,201,249,189,33,100,89,166,245,161,155,54,212,44,127,183,3,19]},"name":"Skyward (Skyward #1) by Brandon Sanderson (.epub)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
