But armies have developed sophisticated ways of overcoming this instinctive aversion. And contemporary civilian society, particularly the media, replicates the army&apos;s conditioning techniques, and, according to Lt. Col. Dave Grossman&apos;s thesis, is responsible for our rising rate of murder among the young.\r\n\r\nUpon its initial publication, ON KILLING was hailed as a landmark study of the techniques the military uses to overcome the powerful reluctance to kill, of how killing affects soldiers, and of the societal implications of escalating violence. Now, Grossman has updated this classic work to include information on 21st-century military conflicts, recent trends in crime, suicide bombings, school shootings, and more. The result is a work certain to be relevant and important for decades to come","last_updated":"2018-04-30T12:11:10.360Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:6710af2d879b405f4b75bb1b0cdabe7f800aad76","dn":"Dave Grossman - On Killing: The Psychological Cost of Learning","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"6710af2d879b405f4b75bb1b0cdabe7f800aad76","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,16,175,45,135,155,64,95,75,117,187,27,12,218,190,127,128,10,173,118]},"name":"Dave Grossman - On Killing: The Psychological Cost of Learning","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
