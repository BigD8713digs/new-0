Ironic and detached, the author shows us the totalitarian World-state through the eyes of a product of that state, scientist Leo Kall. Kall has invented a drug, kallocain, which denies the privacy of thought and is the final step towards the transmutation of the individual human being into a &#x201C;happy, healthy cell in the state organism.&#x201D; For, says Leo, &#x201C;from thoughts and feelings, words and actions are born. How then could these thoughts and feelings belong to the individual? Doesn&#x2019;t the whole fellow-soldier belong to the state? To whom should his thoughts and feelings belong then, if not to the state?&#x201D;\r\nAs the first-person record of Leo Kall, scientist, fellow-soldier too late disillusioned to undo his previous actions, Kallocain achieves a chilling power and veracity that place it among the finest novels to emerge from the strife-torn Europe of the twentieth century","last_updated":"2017-11-02T12:06:23.588Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:97e1c77edd0120eb5978e2df3a5596cf239afed6","dn":"Karin Boye: Kallocain","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"97e1c77edd0120eb5978e2df3a5596cf239afed6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,225,199,126,221,1,32,235,89,120,226,223,58,85,150,207,35,154,254,214]},"name":"Karin Boye: Kallocain","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
