The next day, he&apos;s sent to stay with his grandmother in the small coastal community of Melahatchie, where a young girl named Baize Shephard has recently disappeared.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving, City is given a strange book without an author called Long Division. He learns that one of the book&apos;s main characters is also named City Coldson - but Long Division is set in 1985. This 1985 City, along with his friend and love-object, Shalaya Crump, discovers a way to travel into the future and steals a laptop and cell phone from an orphaned teenage rapper called&#x2026;Baize Shephard.\r\n\r\nThey ultimately take these with them all the way back to 1964, to help another time-traveler they meet protect his family from the Klan.\r\n\r\nCity&apos;s two stories ultimately converge in the mysterious work shed behind his grandmother&apos;s, where he discovers the key to Baize&apos;s disappearance.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-09-14T12:03:03.491Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:95ff9f11c15b5589990766c656200fcf01f3d63e","dn":"Long Division by Kiese Laymon EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"95ff9f11c15b5589990766c656200fcf01f3d63e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,255,159,17,193,91,85,137,153,7,102,198,86,32,15,207,1,243,214,62]},"name":"Long Division by Kiese Laymon EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
