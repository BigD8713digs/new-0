Contributions include essays from established and up-and-coming writers, performers, and critics, including actors Ally Sheedy and Gabrielle Union and writers Amy Jo Burns, Lyz Lenz, and Claire Schwartz.\r\n\r\nCovering a wide range of topics and experiences, from an exploration of the rape epidemic embedded in the refugee crisis to first-person accounts of child molestation, this collection is often deeply personal and is always unflinchingly honest. Like Rebecca Solnit&apos;s Men Explain Things to Me, Not That Bad will resonate with every listener, saying &quot;something in totality that we cannot say alone&quot;.\r\n\r\nSearing and heartbreakingly candid, this provocative collection both reflects the world we live in and offers a call to arms insisting that &quot;not that bad&quot; must no longer be good enough.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-07-01T12:12:39.723Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:24f8512bf6fe4cc38ca8b721067844ae19118e88","dn":"Not That Bad: Dispatches from Rape Culture by Roxane Gay EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"24f8512bf6fe4cc38ca8b721067844ae19118e88","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,248,81,43,246,254,76,195,140,168,183,33,6,120,68,174,25,17,142,136]},"name":"Not That Bad: Dispatches from Rape Culture by Roxane Gay EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
