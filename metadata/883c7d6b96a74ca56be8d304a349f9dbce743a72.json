As if flying back to Phoenix to bury a childhood friend wasn&apos;t hell enough, a cloud of volcanic ash traveling from overseas delayed her flight back home to Boston. Her last ditch attempt to salvage the trip was thwarted by an arrogant Scotsman, Caleb Scott, who steals a first class seat out from under her. Then over the course of their journey home, their antagonism somehow lands them in bed for the steamiest layover Ava&apos;s ever had. And that&apos;s all it was - until Caleb shows up on her doorstep. \r\n\r\nWhen pure chance pulls Ava back into Caleb&apos;s orbit, he proposes they enjoy their physical connection while he&apos;s stranded in Boston. Ava agrees, knowing her heart&apos;s in no danger since a) she barely likes Caleb and b) his existence in her life is temporary. Not long thereafter Ava realizes she&apos;s made a terrible error because as it turns out Caleb Scott isn&apos;t quite so unlikeable after all. When his stay in Boston becomes permanent, Ava must decide whether to fight her feelings for him or give into them. But even if she does decide to risk her heart on Caleb, there is no guarantee her stubborn Scot will want to risk his heart on her....\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-10-14T12:09:31.814Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:883c7d6b96a74ca56be8d304a349f9dbce743a72","dn":"Fight or Flight by Samantha Young EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"883c7d6b96a74ca56be8d304a349f9dbce743a72","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,60,125,107,150,167,76,165,107,232,211,4,163,73,249,219,206,116,58,114]},"name":"Fight or Flight by Samantha Young EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
