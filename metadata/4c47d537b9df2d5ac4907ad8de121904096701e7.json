The year that The Wizard of Oz and Gone with the Wind were made. Detective Craine has spent his life working as a studio fixer, whitewashing the misdemeanours and crimes committed by the studio players and stars. But now he&apos;s trying to turn his back on that life following the recent death of his wife as he&apos;s determined to be a better parent to his young son.\r\n\r\nBut then Craine&apos;s services are called upon one last time. MGM need him to smooth over the press coverage of the suicide of one of their producers. And soon, what should be a straightforward case proves anything but when connections are made between it and a brutal murder across town. And that&apos;s just the start of the story.\r\n\r\nIt&apos;s only a matter of time before Craine must decide whether to follow orders, or to attempt to redeem a career of concealment by going in search of the ugly truth. It&apos;s a choice he knows that cannot end well.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-10-13T12:08:55.050Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c47d537b9df2d5ac4907ad8de121904096701e7","dn":"The Pictures (Detective Craine, Book 1) by Guy Bolton EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"4c47d537b9df2d5ac4907ad8de121904096701e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,71,213,55,185,223,45,90,196,144,122,216,222,18,25,4,9,103,1,231]},"name":"The Pictures (Detective Craine, Book 1) by Guy Bolton EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
