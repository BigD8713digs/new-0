He goes to the hospital, remembers the doctors and the commotion, but when he wakes up it all seems like a dream. However, if that was a dream how do you explain waking up in another body and in another world? Little Wallie finds himself in the physique of a barbarian swordsman, accompanied by both an eccentric priest babbling about the Goddess and a voluptuous slave girl. Is this a rude awakening or a dream come true?\r\n\r\nWhat in the world will Wallie do now that he&apos;s found himself stranded in a strange realm? Well it just so happens that the Goddess is in need of a swordsman. It won&apos;t be easy but if he succeeds he will have everything he wants. If he doesn&apos;t, things could get ugly.\r\n\r\nWallie is reluctant but sees his chance. If only he had the faintest clue as to the adventure he is about to unleash! If only he could imagine the forces that will be out to vanquish him!\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-09-22T12:32:16.835Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4b9b12591f3ba5035f549de4348495280c4a7ea","dn":"The Reluctant Swordsman by Dave Duncan EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"c4b9b12591f3ba5035f549de4348495280c4a7ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,185,177,37,145,243,186,80,53,245,73,222,67,72,73,82,128,196,167,234]},"name":"The Reluctant Swordsman by Dave Duncan EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
