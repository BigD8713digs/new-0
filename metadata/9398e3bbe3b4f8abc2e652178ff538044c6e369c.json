A ferocious riff on women in superhero comics\r\n\r\nFrom the New York Times bestselling author Catherynne Valente comes a series of linked stories from the points of view of the wives and girlfriends of superheroes, female heroes, and anyone who&#x2019;s ever been &#x201C;refrigerated&#x201D;: comic book women who are killed, raped, brainwashed, driven mad, disabled, or had their powers taken so that a male superhero&#x2019;s storyline will progress.\r\n\r\nIn an entirely new and original superhero universe, Valente subversively explores these ideas and themes in the superhero genre, treating them with the same love, gravity, and humor as her fairy tales. After all, superheroes are our new fairy tales and these six women have their own stories to share","last_updated":"2017-08-04T12:01:07.136Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:9398e3bbe3b4f8abc2e652178ff538044c6e369c","dn":"The Refrigerator Monologues - Catherynne M.
