The book starts by describing the etiology, microscopical appearance, production of odor, epidemiology and pathogenesis, direction of peripheral spreading, differential and clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of antinomycosis. The book then discusses cytology and morphology, distribution, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of aerobic actinomycetes. Saprophytism; parasitism; the classification and morphology of leptotrichia; chief bacteria and cocci in the mouth; and Actinomyces odontolyticus, a new species of antinomycete regularly isolated from deep carious dentine, are also looked into. The book further tackles the discovery of antibiotics and the role of antibiotics in the treatment of actinomycosis. The text also describes the nature and properties, group divisions, mode of action, investigations of sensitivities, methods of administration, and the side effects and toxic effects of penicillin. Antibiotic production in soil; problems of generic nomenclature; relation of actinomycetes to bacteria and fungi; and the classification systems of actinomycetes are also considered. Dental and medical professionals will find the book useful","last_updated":"2017-06-12T12:02:42.820Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:ccf526c97ffa2cc81f5d8e69058a70e476ebc2ce","dn":"Actinomycosis 2nd ed","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"ccf526c97ffa2cc81f5d8e69058a70e476ebc2ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,245,38,201,127,250,44,200,31,93,142,105,5,138,112,228,118,235,194,206]},"name":"Actinomycosis 2nd ed","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
