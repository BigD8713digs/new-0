Frater and W.M. Goss\r\nSpringer | November 2017 | ISBN-10: 3319655981 | ePUB/True PDF | 209 Pages | 8.70/13.8 mb \r\n\r\nThis is the story of Bernie Mills, Chris Christiansen, Paul Wild and Ron Bracewell, members of a team of radio astronomers that would lead Australia, and the world, into this new field of research. Each of the four is remembered for his remarkable work: Mills for the development the cross type instrument that now bears his name; Christiansen for the application of rotational synthesis techniques; Wild for the masterful joining of observations and theory to elicit the nature of the solar atmosphere; Bracewell for his contribution to imaging theory.\r\nAs well, these Four Pillars are remembered for creating a remarkable environment for scientific discovery and for influencing the careers of future generations. Their pursuit of basic science helped pave the way for technological developments in areas ranging from Wi-Fi to sonar to medical imaging to air navigation, and for underpinning the foundations of modern cosmology and astrophysics.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n1 Introduction  . . . 1\r\n2 Beginnings: Some Basics and Some History  . . . 7\r\n3 BernieMills: Cross-Type Telescopes and Discrete Radio Sources . . . 23\r\n4 Chris Christiansen: Telescope Design and Earth-Rotational Synthesis . . . 59\r\n5 Paul Wild: Radio Astronomy and the Sun  . . . 91\r\n6 Ron Bracewell: Mathematics and Imaging  . . . 131\r\n7 Influences of the Four Pillars Beyond Radio Astronomy  . . . 153\r\n8 Conclusions  . . . 167\r\nAppendix A: What Is a Radio Telescope?  . . . 169\r\nAppendix B: Paul Wild: The Beer Disaster of November 1957  . . . 181\r\nAppendix C: Supercomputing Cluster  . . . 183\r\nAppendix D: Time Line of Key Events  . . . 185\r\nAppendix E: Dramatis Personae for Four Pillars of Radio Astronomy . . . 189\r\nAppendix F: Abbreviations  . . . 193\r\nIndex . . . 195\r\n <a href=\"\nhttps://s1.postimg.org/8tfvqs2ugf/Four_Pillars_of_Radio_Astronomy.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://s1.postimg.org/8tfvqs2ugf/Four_Pillars_of_Radio_Astronomy.jpg</a>","last_updated":"2017-10-31T12:12:56.666Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:7866e16dc1d6c324f8a874cb1128e18bc2843ef4","dn":"Four Pillars of Radio Astronomy (gnv64)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"7866e16dc1d6c324f8a874cb1128e18bc2843ef4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,102,225,109,193,214,195,36,248,168,116,203,17,40,225,139,194,132,62,244]},"name":"Four Pillars of Radio Astronomy (gnv64)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
