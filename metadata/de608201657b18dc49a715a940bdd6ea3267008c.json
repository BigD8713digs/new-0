The idea behind the project is to create a classic &apos;90&apos;s era sound hip-hop album which will run parallel with a retro game themed to specifically reflect the album&apos;s musical content, with each audio track corresponding to a level within the retro game in all aspects.\r\n\r\nThe digital copy of music album &quot;Binary Gospell LP&quot; by Saint Ignatius of Cyberspace will be made via digital download and via mobile app, supported on Android, iOS, and Windows platforms, and the digital download of the retro game will have the accessibility and compatibility options of PICO-8 web cart player, or exported to stand-alone HTML5, Windows, Mac and Linux apps.\r\n\r\nThe autographed limited edition hard copy (CD), Hoodie, and T-Shirt rewards will be available for shipping worldwide.\r\n\r\nFinally, anyone wishing to pledge for the top-level reward will receive all rewards, with the addition of a autographed Raspberry Pi which was used in the creation process of this project. The top-level reward is limited to one person only.\r\n\r\nor Donate in Crypto:\r\n\r\nBTC: 1Pu1ymV3gb622E3GcTRPt2YZmomMzKyHES\r\nETH: 0x700f358098df656c57abecb2c61f664efdd1f97d\r\nLTC: LTbXoG7UXaLhJCA1dbyoCgQvc2mSR67eTk","last_updated":"2018-09-07T12:10:19.780Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:de608201657b18dc49a715a940bdd6ea3267008c","dn":"Raspberry Pi Project: Retro Game and Hip-Hop Album","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"de608201657b18dc49a715a940bdd6ea3267008c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,96,130,1,101,123,24,220,73,167,21,169,64,189,214,234,50,103,0,140]},"name":"Raspberry Pi Project: Retro Game and Hip-Hop Album","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
