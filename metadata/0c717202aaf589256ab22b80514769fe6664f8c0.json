It transformed not only the states-system of the Continent but the whole climate of European moral and political thought. The overwhelming triumph of German military might, evoking general admiration and imitation, introduced an era of power politics, which was to reach its disastrous climax in 1914.\r\n\r\nFirst published in 1961 and now with a new introduction, The Franco-Prussian War is acknowledged as the definitive history of one of the most dramatic and decisive conflicts in the history of Europe.\r\n\r\nSir Michael Howard was the Regius Professor of Modern History at the University of Oxford from 1980-1989. He was Professor of History at Yale University from 1989-1993.\r\n\r\nPaperback: 532 pages\r\nPublisher: Routledge; 2nd edition (November 11, 2001)","last_updated":"2017-09-03T12:01:58.149Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c717202aaf589256ab22b80514769fe6664f8c0","dn":"The Franco-Prussian War: The German Invasion of France 1870/1","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"0c717202aaf589256ab22b80514769fe6664f8c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,113,114,2,170,245,137,37,106,178,43,128,81,71,105,254,102,100,248,192]},"name":"The Franco-Prussian War: The German Invasion of France 1870/1","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
