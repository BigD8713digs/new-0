Antidotes are very few and hard to come by. Confront not only zombies, but the same soldiers as you. After all, only one of the survivors will receive the main prize, the antidote. Look for weapons or take them away from dead enemies. Do not become zombie food yourself, stay alive! And remember, it&#x2019;s each man for himself","last_updated":"2017-11-19T12:09:32.564Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b7852ccd9d4ffe4cb9dcc3d794eb70b911a63ee","dn":"Dead City","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"8b7852ccd9d4ffe4cb9dcc3d794eb70b911a63ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,120,82,204,217,212,255,228,203,157,204,61,121,78,183,11,145,26,99,238]},"name":"Dead City","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
