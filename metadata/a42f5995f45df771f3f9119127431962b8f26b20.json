Happyaku Bikuni supposedly became immortal as the result of eating mermaid&apos;s flesh, and lived for eight hundred years before finally disappearing into a cave in Wakasa. Now the nun only seeks death from her various lovers, though she can never seem to achieve it.\r\n\r\nSacred Mother Kannon has numerous ties to In the Realm of the Senses. Wakamatsu was the line producer and was responsible for hiring many cast/crew members. Eiko Matsuda returns as the lead in one her infrequent appearances, as do cinematographer Hideo Ito and composer Minoru Miki.\r\n\r\nScreenplay by frequent Oshima collaborator Mamoru Sasaki. A young Renji Ishibashi also makes an appearance.\r\n\r\nSubtitles by nitroblast for ADC\r\nTranscription assistance by quaisnord","last_updated":"2018-04-23T12:06:20.356Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:a42f5995f45df771f3f9119127431962b8f26b20","dn":"Seibo Kannon daibosatsu (K&ocirc;ji Wakamatsu, 1977) 1080p","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"a42f5995f45df771f3f9119127431962b8f26b20","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,47,89,149,244,93,247,113,243,249,17,145,39,67,25,98,184,242,107,32]},"name":"Seibo Kannon daibosatsu (K&ocirc;ji Wakamatsu, 1977) 1080p","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
