Often considered the most elegant tank design of the war, it embodied a balance of firepower, armour protection, and mobility unmatched by any other tank of the period. This new study by German armour expert Thomas Anderson draws upon original German archival material to tell the story of the birth of the Panther in response to the Soviet tanks encountered in 1941. He then analyzes its success on the battlefield and the many modifications and variants that also came into play. Illustrated throughout with rare photographs and drawings, many of which have never been published in English before, this is a unique history of one of the most famous tanks of World War II","last_updated":"2017-09-23T12:01:51.368Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3e94df60519025ba3eab491fadd6732592adff9","dn":"Panther (Osprey General Military)(2017) - True PDF - zeke23","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"c3e94df60519025ba3eab491fadd6732592adff9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,233,77,246,5,25,2,91,163,234,180,145,250,221,103,50,89,42,223,249]},"name":"Panther (Osprey General Military)(2017) - True PDF - zeke23","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
