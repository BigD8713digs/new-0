The hippies failed politically, but their cultural influence changed the world. Everything from the environmental movement to the explosion in alternative health practices to the birth of feminism all grew out of this moment. And most surprising of all, we trace how hippie ideas first imagined on LSD went on to shape the information age itself.\r\n\r\n(with soft subtitles) \r\n\r\nFirst broadcast: 16 June 2017\r\nDuration: 1 hour","last_updated":"2017-06-17T12:03:41.477Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd928a97803a0272116fd88116ae449631d38ef4","dn":"The Summer of Love - How Hippies Changed the World S01E02","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"fd928a97803a0272116fd88116ae449631d38ef4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,146,138,151,128,58,2,114,17,111,216,129,22,174,68,150,49,211,142,244]},"name":"The Summer of Love - How Hippies Changed the World S01E02","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
