Most of us treat it as a regrettable, even shameful, event best overlooked. In truth, failure can be a game-changing strategic resource that can help you and your organization achieve the greater success you crave.\r\n\r\nThe Other &quot;F&quot; Word shows how successful leaders and teams are putting failure to work every day - to re-engage employees, spark innovation, and accelerate growth. Authors Danner and Coopersmith - with their rare blend of senior-level executive experience, global advising, teaching acumen and cross-discipline perspective - share these valuable new practices, and show how they can improve results across your organization. Based on exclusive interviews with prominent leaders and insightful examples from their own in-depth work, the book features a practical seven-stage framework to liberate failure as a force to advance your leadership agenda. After all, everyone creates and confronts failure on a daily basis. Why not use it to your advantage? The Other &quot;F&quot; Word shows you how to:\r\n\r\nStart an open, productive conversation about failure across your organization\r\nReduce the fear of failure that stifles initiative, creativity, and engagement\r\nAnticipate, prepare for, and respond to failure, so you can leverage it when it happens\r\nHarness failure as a catalyst to drive innovation, improve performance, and strengthen culture\r\n\r\nFailure&apos;s like gravity - pervasive and powerful. Whether you&apos;re a leader or team member of a startup, a growing business, or an established enterprise, failure is today&apos;s lesson for tomorrow. Let The Other &quot;F&quot; Word show you how to apply this lesson and take your company where it needs to go.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-12-09T12:07:07.668Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:1acf903d9f0dc7622f2d273d5c1e321cc37990a2","dn":"The Other 'F' Word_ How Smart Leaders .. by John Danner EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"1acf903d9f0dc7622f2d273d5c1e321cc37990a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,207,144,61,159,13,199,98,47,45,39,61,92,30,50,28,195,121,144,162]},"name":"The Other 'F' Word_ How Smart Leaders .. by John Danner EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
