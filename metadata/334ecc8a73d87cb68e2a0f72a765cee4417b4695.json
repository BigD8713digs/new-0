City is sprawling, technocratic, and rests hundreds of feet above the coastline on the creaking shoulders of a giant wooden pier. When the narrator&apos;s single mother, whom he left behind in City, falls out of contact, he fears the worst: his mother is homeless and subsequently to be deported under City to the Pier. On his desperate search to find his mother, he encounters ecoterrorists wearing plush animal suits, City&apos;s all-powerful Mayor who is infatuated with magic refrigerators and outlaw campaigns, and an over-sexed priest who may or may not have ESP, but who is most certainly his deadbeat dad.\r\n\r\nWhether rebelling against regimented and ridiculous Farm life, exploring the consumer-obsessed world of City, experiencing the suffering of the homeless in Pier, or confronting the secrets of his own childhood, Swallowing a Donkey&apos;s Eye&apos;s narrator is a hilarious, neurotic, and rage-filled Quixote searching for his mother, his own dignity, and the meaning of humanity.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-06-03T12:11:10.464Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:334ecc8a73d87cb68e2a0f72a765cee4417b4695","dn":"Swallowing a Donkey's Eye by Paul Tremblay MOBI","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"334ecc8a73d87cb68e2a0f72a765cee4417b4695","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,78,204,138,115,216,124,182,142,42,15,114,167,101,206,228,65,123,70,149]},"name":"Swallowing a Donkey's Eye by Paul Tremblay MOBI","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
