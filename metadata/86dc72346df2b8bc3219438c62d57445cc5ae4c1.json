If you study Seneca, you&apos;ll be in good company. He was popular with the educated elite of the Greco-Roman Empire, but Thomas Jefferson also had Seneca on his bedside table. Thought leaders in Silicon Valley tout the benefits of Stoicism, and NFL management, coaches, and players alike - from teams such as the Patriots and Seahawks - have embraced it because the principles make them better competitors. Stoicism is a no-nonsense philosophical system designed to produce dramatic real-world effects. Think of it as an ideal operating system for thriving in high-stress environments. This is your guide. \r\n\r\nListening Length: 8 hours and 51 minutes","last_updated":"2017-10-15T12:03:27.432Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:86dc72346df2b8bc3219438c62d57445cc5ae4c1","dn":"The Tao of Seneca Practical Letters from a Stoic Master Volume 1","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"86dc72346df2b8bc3219438c62d57445cc5ae4c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,220,114,52,109,242,184,188,50,25,67,140,98,213,116,69,204,90,228,193]},"name":"The Tao of Seneca Practical Letters from a Stoic Master Volume 1","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
