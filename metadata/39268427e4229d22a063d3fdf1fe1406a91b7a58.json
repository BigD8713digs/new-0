Robert Resnick,? Jearl Walker\r\nWiley | August 2013 | ISBN-10: 111823071X | 1440 Pages | PDF | 31.3 mb\r\n\r\nThis new edition offers most accurate, extensive and varied set of assessment questions of any course management program in addition to all questions including some form of question assistance including answer specific feedback to facilitate success. The text also offers multimedia presentations (videos and animations) of much of the material that provide an alternative pathway through the material for those who struggle with reading scientific exposition. Furthermore, the book includes math review content in both a self-study module for more in-depth review and also in just-in-time math videos for a quick refresher on a specific topic.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n1 Measurement 2 Motion Along a Straight Line 3 Vectors\r\n4 Motion in Two and Three Dimensions 5 Force and Motion&#x2014;I 6 Force and Motion&#x2014;II\r\n7 Kinetic Energy and Work 8 Potential Energy and Conservation of Energy 9 Center of Mass and Linear Momentum\r\n10 Rotation 11 Rolling, Torque, and Angular Momentum 12 Equilibrium and Elasticity\r\n13 Gravitation 14 Fluids 15 Oscillations 16 Waves&#x2014;I 17 WavesII\r\n18 Temperature, Heat, and the First Law of Thermodyn 19 The Kinetic Theory of Gases\r\n20 Entropy and the Second Law of Thermodynamics 21 Coulomb&apos;s Law 22 Electric Fields\r\n23 Gauss&apos; Law 24 Electric Potential 25 Capacitance 26 Current and Resistance\r\n27 Circuits 28 Magnetic Fields 29 Magnetic Fields Due to Currents 30 Induction and Inductance\r\n31 Electromagnetic Oscillations and Alternating Current 32 Maxwell&apos;s Equations; Magnetism of Matter\r\n33 Electromagnetic Waves 34 Images 35 Interference 36 Diffraction 37 Relativity\r\n38 Photons and Matter Waves 39 More About Matter Waves 40 All About Atoms 41 Conduction of Electricity in Solids\r\n42 Nuclear Physics 43 Energy from the Nucleus 44 Quarks, Leptons, and the Big Bang\r\nAPPENDICES\r\nANSWERS\r\nINDEX\r\n <a href=\"\nhttps://s7.postimg.org/96vlmb8vv/Fundamentals_of_Physics_Extended_10th_Ed.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://s7.postimg.org/96vlmb8vv/Fundamentals_of_Physics_Extended_10th_Ed.jpg</a>","last_updated":"2017-12-04T12:00:43.237Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:39268427e4229d22a063d3fdf1fe1406a91b7a58","dn":"Fundamentals of Physics Extended (10th Ed)(gnv64)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"39268427e4229d22a063d3fdf1fe1406a91b7a58","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,38,132,39,228,34,157,34,160,99,211,253,241,254,20,6,169,27,122,88]},"name":"Fundamentals of Physics Extended (10th Ed)(gnv64)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
