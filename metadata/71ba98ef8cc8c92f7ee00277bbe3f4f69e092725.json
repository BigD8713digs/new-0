CleanMyPC includes a suite of cleaning tools for Windows computers. The main cleaning component promises to remove gigabytes of files from a PC, and is backed up by five maintenance tools: Secure Erase, Complete Uninstall, Registry Maintenance, Autorun and Gadgets &amp; Extensions Manager. \r\n\r\n\r\nFEATURES - \r\nScanning \r\n* During a scan CleanMyPC analyzes your hard drive to find files which might be safely removed. They are split into four categories - &#x201C;Caches &amp; Logs&#x201D;, &#x201C;Help Files&#x201D;, &#x201C;Extra Languages&#x201D; and &#x201C;Trash &amp; Junk&#x201D;. Let?s walk through them to explain what exactly is found. \r\n\r\nCaches &amp; Logs \r\n* While Windows and applications run on your computer they usually store chunks of &#x201C;prepared&#x201D; data on the hard drive to expedite load. Those chunks are called &#x201C;Cache files&#x201D;. However, sometimes these applications do not remove the files and while some apps come with built-in &#x201C;cache control mechanisms&#x201D;, the majority of those (including the Windows itself) leave a significant amount of data sitting unneeded on your hard drive. CleanMyPC can identify those files and let you know which of them are safe to delete. Log files record the activity of Windows and applications and are usually used for informational purposes. Removing them will not affect the functionality of your applications but might recover you hard drive space. \r\n\r\nHelp Files \r\n* Most applications (as well as Windows itself) come with help files which contain information about program functionality and workflow. You can safely remove help files for the applications that you already use freely. CleanMyPC allows you to selectively remove help files by clicking the corresponding &#x201C;Help Files&#x201D; section of the sidebar and checking only those you want removed","last_updated":"2017-11-01T12:03:51.314Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:71ba98ef8cc8c92f7ee00277bbe3f4f69e092725","dn":"MacPaw CleanMyPC 1.8.9.1067   Crack [CracksNow]","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"71ba98ef8cc8c92f7ee00277bbe3f4f69e092725","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,186,152,239,140,200,201,47,126,224,2,119,187,227,244,246,158,9,39,37]},"name":"MacPaw CleanMyPC 1.8.9.1067   Crack [CracksNow]","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
