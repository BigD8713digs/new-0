Both groups rise to power through the exploitation of fear. Sometimes the fear derives from a pre-existing threat. At other times, crises are created or intensified to invoke a sense of panic and anxiety where none previously existed.\r\n\r\nThis pattern is as predictable as it is destructive. The end result is the same: a loss of liberty. Policies that are costly, oppressive, and harmful are supported by people who abandon any interest in freedom or personal responsibility in hopes of feeling safe.\r\n\r\nManufactured fear, with its negative impact on liberty, is a societal plague. There have been widespread casualties. We need an antidote. Feardom offers its readers a much-needed immunization.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-10-11T12:01:21.067Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:711825750d7830993f7f367c2f8c49cc115d67ff","dn":"Feardom by Connor Boyack EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"711825750d7830993f7f367c2f8c49cc115d67ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,24,37,117,13,120,48,153,63,127,54,124,47,140,73,204,17,93,103,255]},"name":"Feardom by Connor Boyack EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
