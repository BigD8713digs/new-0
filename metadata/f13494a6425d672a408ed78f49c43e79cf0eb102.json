England throws wave after wave of RAF bombers across the Channel, but somehow the Luftwaffe is able to shoot them down at will. The skies, indeed, the war itself seem to belong to Hitler.\r\n\r\nOn a Danish island across the North Sea, Harald Olufsen stumbles upon a secret German installation. With England preparing its largest aerial assault, what Harald has discovered may turn the course of the war, but the race to convey the information could have terrible consequences for everyone close to him. For his older brother, Arne, a pilot in the Danish air force, and for Arne&apos;s fiancee, Hermia, an intelligence analyst desperate to resurrect the foundering Danish resistance. And most of all, for Harald himself.\r\n\r\nFilled with knife-edge suspense and rich, tantalizing characters, this is Ken Follett writing at the top of his form, unforgettable storytelling from an unforgettable writer.\r\n\r\nDon&apos;t miss Ken Follet discussing the history of the thriller and its role in literature at the 92nd Street Y.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-12-25T12:06:02.401Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:f13494a6425d672a408ed78f49c43e79cf0eb102","dn":"Hornet Flight by Ken Follett EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"f13494a6425d672a408ed78f49c43e79cf0eb102","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,52,148,166,66,93,103,42,64,142,215,143,73,196,62,121,207,14,177,2]},"name":"Hornet Flight by Ken Follett EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
