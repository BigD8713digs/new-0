But the pressure each day to stay alive sends many in the group to the deepest depths of human cruelty, and Rick discovers that the overwhelming fear of the survivors can be more deadly than the zombies walking among them.\r\n\r\nFirst episode date: 31 October 2010\r\nTheme song: The Walking Dead theme song","last_updated":"2017-12-04T12:07:02.816Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:239e35495a5d560d207f164878d5be47bcef2c83","dn":"The.Walking.Dead.S08E07.720p.HDTV.x264.[Season.8.Episode.7]","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"239e35495a5d560d207f164878d5be47bcef2c83","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,158,53,73,90,93,86,13,32,127,22,72,120,213,190,71,188,239,44,131]},"name":"The.Walking.Dead.S08E07.720p.HDTV.x264.[Season.8.Episode.7]","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
