Missy had been his first love, and Miles fervently believes she will be his last. As a deputy sheriff in the North Carolina town of New Bern, Miles Ryan not only grieves for Missy, but longs to bring the unknown driver to justice.\r\n\r\nThen Miles meets Sarah Andrews. The second grade teacher of his son Jonah, Sarah had left Baltimore after a difficult divorce to start over in the gentler surroundings of New Bern. Perhaps it is her own emotional wounds that make her sensitive to the hurt she first sees in Jonah&apos;s eyes, and then his father&apos;s. Tentatively, Sarah and Miles reach out to each other. Soon, they are both laughing for the first time in years...and falling in love.\r\n\r\nNeither will be able to guess how closely linked they are to a shocking secret - one that will force them to question everything they ever believed in...and make a heartbreaking choice that will change their lives forever.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-07-04T12:00:22.734Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:ddbb6c6d29ef14639f7b6bebc9b72bd3b88e41e8","dn":"A Bend in the Road by Nicholas Sparks epub RtR","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"ddbb6c6d29ef14639f7b6bebc9b72bd3b88e41e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,187,108,109,41,239,20,99,159,123,107,235,201,183,43,211,184,142,65,232]},"name":"A Bend in the Road by Nicholas Sparks epub RtR","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
