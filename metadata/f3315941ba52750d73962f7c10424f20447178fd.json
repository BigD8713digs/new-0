So you&apos;ll love the Battles. Mo is about to hit the big 50, and some uncomfortable truths are becoming quite apparent. She doesn&apos;t understand either of her teenage kids, which for a child psychologist is fairly embarrassing. She has become grey. Inside and out. Her face has surrendered and is frightening children. Dora is about to hit the big 18 . . . and about to hit anyone who annoys her, especially her precocious younger brother Peter, who has a chronic Oscar Wilde fixation. Then there&apos;s Dad . . . who&apos;s just, well, Dad. A TINY BIT MARVELLOUS is the story of a modern family, all living in their own seperate bubbles, lurching towards meltdown. It is for anyone who has ever shared a home with that weird group of strangers we call relations.Oh, and there&apos;s a dog. Called Poo &apos;Funny, really enjoyable, highly recommended. A wonderful writer - witty, wise, poignant.&apos; Daily Mail &apos;Fresh, extremely funny.&apos; Sunday Times &apos;Very funny . . . moving, comforting, very amusing.&apos; Daily Mirror &apos;Hilarious. Chortle-out-loud turns of phrase, razor-sharp observations.&apos; Stylist &apos;Beautifully observed. Makes you laugh on every page and contains the funniest appraisal of smear tests that I have read.&apos; The Times &apos;Has she cracked it with her debut novel? Yes, actually, she has. Engaging from the first page . . . It&apos;s a new Dawn.&apos; Heat &apos;A hilarious and compelling read.&apos; Good Housekeeping &apos;A brilliantly observed, very funny novel of family life.&apos; Woman and Home","last_updated":"2018-06-02T12:14:54.792Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:f3315941ba52750d73962f7c10424f20447178fd","dn":"A Tiny Bit Marvellous - Dawn French Epub","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"f3315941ba52750d73962f7c10424f20447178fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,49,89,65,186,82,117,13,115,150,47,124,16,66,79,32,68,113,120,253]},"name":"A Tiny Bit Marvellous - Dawn French Epub","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
