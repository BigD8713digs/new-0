Her name is Cinnamon. Cin for short. Band mates Strat and Indy don&apos;t know anything about her except she&apos;s smart as hell and sexy as heaven. They can&apos;t agree who gets her, so they do the only thing two best friends could do. They declare her off limits to both of them.\r\n\r\nMargie, AKA Cinnamon-you-can-call-me-Cin, has a thing or two to tell these guys. Nobody &quot;gets&quot; her. She&apos;ll let them know which one she wants when she can decide between them. Until then, their little pledges and promises aren&apos;t her problem. Her family is her problem. Her friends. And the world-famous blues rocker who has her cornered. He&apos;s her problem too. This may be one problem she can&apos;t fix without some help.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-07-25T12:00:36.067Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:49602e77ff93f61f7e646e358bfb575de0f07949","dn":"Secret Sins by C D Reiss ePUB MOBI eBOOK-ZAK","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"49602e77ff93f61f7e646e358bfb575de0f07949","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,96,46,119,255,147,246,31,126,100,110,53,139,251,87,93,224,240,121,73]},"name":"Secret Sins by C D Reiss ePUB MOBI eBOOK-ZAK","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
