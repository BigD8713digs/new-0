DVD has a total running time of 58 minutes, and video quality is about 8/10.  Track listing is as follows:\r\n\r\nAsleep at the wheel\r\nAll I wanna be (is by your side)\r\nShow me the way\r\nRoad to the sun\r\nBlack Hole sun\r\nInterview\r\n\r\nThis region-free DVD-R is in NTSC format and will play on most Gaming consoles and DVD Players made since 2000, and comes in a FULL SIZE DVD case, with cover art and track listing.\r\n\r\nIt was the night I was both very lucky and very privileged to be a part of a crowd of less than 150 people to watch a very intimate acoustic concert, moderated interview, Q&amp;A, and signing by guitar legend Peter Frampton.  It was also the night he embarrassed me in front of the entire crowd for not knowing that he does not discuss anything about his 1978 film involvement of Sgt. Pepper&#x2019;s Lonely Hearts Club Band.\r\n <a href=\"\nhttps://imgur.com/tWLEBWP\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://imgur.com/tWLEBWP</a>\r\n <a href=\"\nhttps://imgur.com/gZ48JFJ\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://imgur.com/gZ48JFJ</a>\r\n <a href=\"\nhttps://imgur.com/oaXTpsO\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://imgur.com/oaXTpsO</a>","last_updated":"2017-09-24T12:01:43.885Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:365183699628edddf75dd26ee682f809e541a763","dn":"Peter Frampton - 2010-05-26 - Guitar Center Sessions - DVD5","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"365183699628edddf75dd26ee682f809e541a763","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,81,131,105,150,40,237,221,247,93,210,110,230,130,248,9,229,65,167,99]},"name":"Peter Frampton - 2010-05-26 - Guitar Center Sessions - DVD5","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
