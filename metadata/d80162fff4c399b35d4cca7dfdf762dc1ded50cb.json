Hartel , Joachim H. von Elbe, Randy Hofberger\r\nSpringer | October 2017 | ISBN 978-3-319-61740-4 | 536 Pages | PDF | 13.82 mb\r\n\r\nThis book examines both the primary ingredients and the processing technology for making candies. In the first section, the chemistry, structure, and physical properties of the primary ingredients are described, as are the characteristics of commercial ingredients. The second section explores the processing steps for each of the major sugar confectionery groups, while the third section covers chocolate and coatings. The manner in which ingredients function together to provide the desired texture and sensory properties of the product is analyzed, and chemical reactions and physical changes that occur during processing are examined. Trouble shooting and common problems are also discussed in each section.\r\nDesigned as a complete reference and guide, Confectionery Science and Technology provides personnel in industry with solutions to the problems concerning the manufacture of high-quality confectionery products.\r\n\r\nAbout the Authors\r\nRichard W. Hartel, is Professor of Food Engineering with the Department of Food Science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He conducts research on phase transitions in foods, primarily sugar confections, chocolate and ice cream. He teaches courses in Food Manufacturing, Food Preservation, Food Functionality, and Candy Science, as well as a freshman career orientation course.\r\nRandall (Randy) Hofberger is the principle of R &amp; D Candy Consultants LLC. Previously he had a long career at Nestle Confections USA in technical applications with an emphasis on caramels and chocolates. He has been an instructor at various confectionery courses including UW Resident Course in Confectionery Technology (candy school) and Retail Confectioners International (RCI).\r\nJoachim H. von Elbe, is Professor and Chairman Emeritus with the Department of Food Science at the University of Wisconsin. He served for 38 years teaching courses in food chemistry with emphasis on plant pigments, their use as food and pharmaceutical colorants, and color and texture changes in canned vegetables.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\nPart I Ingredient Chemistry and Functionality\r\n1 Chemistry of Bulk Sweeteners 3\r\n2 Physico-chemical Properties of Sweeteners in Confections  39\r\n3 Water  69\r\n4 Fats, Oils and Emulsifiers  85\r\n5 Starches, Proteins, Pectin, and Gums  125\r\n6 Other Ingredients  151\r\nPart II Sugar-Based Confections\r\n7 Compressed Tablets and Lozenges 189\r\n8 Hard Candy  211\r\n9 Fondants and Creams  245\r\n10 Caramel, Fudge and Toffee 273\r\n11 Aerated Confections  301\r\n12 Jellies, Gummies and Licorices  329\r\n13 Sugar and Sugar-Free Panned Confections 361\r\n14 Chewing and Bubble Gum 393\r\nPart III Chocolate and Compound Coatings\r\n15 Chocolate  423\r\n16 Compound Coatings  485\r\n17 Chocolate Panning  501\r\nGlossary  511\r\nIndex  517\r\n <a href=\"\nhttps://s1.postimg.org/9e425om0kf/Confectionery_Science_and_Technology.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://s1.postimg.org/9e425om0kf/Confectionery_Science_and_Technology.jpg</a>","last_updated":"2017-10-20T12:04:59.109Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:d80162fff4c399b35d4cca7dfdf762dc1ded50cb","dn":"Confectionery Science and Technology (gnv64)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"d80162fff4c399b35d4cca7dfdf762dc1ded50cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,1,98,255,244,195,153,179,93,76,202,125,253,247,98,220,29,237,80,203]},"name":"Confectionery Science and Technology (gnv64)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
