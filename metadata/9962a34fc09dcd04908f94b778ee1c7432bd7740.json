All these qualities have no doubt been at the root of\r\nhis success along with his clear intelligence I believe on matters he deals with\r\nregularly I should think.\r\n\r\n\r\nplease seed if you are able to - \r\nwith thanks kindly\r\n\r\nMichael Rizzo Chessman\r\n(moviesbyrizzo)\r\n\r\nI initially viewed this documentary on-line at kanopy.com - a free service to\r\nPublic library Card holders in areas serviced by them - and got this copy of it \r\nfor you folks here.
