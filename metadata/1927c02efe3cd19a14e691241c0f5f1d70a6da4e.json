The stated goal of the Cultural Revolution was to purge the country of bourgeois, capitalistic elements he claimed were threatening genuine communist ideology. Young students formed the Red Guards, vowing to defend the Chairman to the death, but soon rival factions started fighting each other in the streets with semiautomatic weapons in the name of revolutionary purity. As the country descended into chaos, the military intervened, turning China into a garrison state marked by bloody purges that crushed as many as one in 50 people.\r\n\r\nThe Cultural Revolution: A People&apos;s History, 1962-1976 draws for the first time on hundreds of previously classified party documents, from secret police reports to unexpurgated versions of leadership speeches. Frank Dik&#xF6;tter uses this wealth of material to undermine the picture of complete conformity that is often supposed to have characterized the last years of the Mao era.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-09-01T12:00:12.992Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:1927c02efe3cd19a14e691241c0f5f1d70a6da4e","dn":"The Cultural Revolution_ A People's History, 1962-1976 by Frank ","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"1927c02efe3cd19a14e691241c0f5f1d70a6da4e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,39,192,46,254,60,209,154,20,230,145,36,28,15,95,29,112,166,218,78]},"name":"The Cultural Revolution_ A People's History, 1962-1976 by Frank ","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
