His biggest musical influences are Bob Dylan, Woody Guthrie, James Brown and the Rolling Stones. Rolling Stone contributor Anthony DeCurtis said: &quot;Mellencamp has created an important body of work that has earned him both critical regard and an enormous audience. \r\n\r\nHis songs document the joys and struggles of ordinary people seeking to make their way, and he has consistently brought the fresh air of common experience to the typically glamour-addled world of popular music.&quot;\r\nJohnny Cash called Mellencamp &quot;one of the 10 best songwriters&quot; in music.\r\n\r\nJohn Mellencamp\r\nBowery Ballroom\r\nNew York City, New York\r\nOctober 6th, 1998\r\nFM Broadcast\r\n\r\n1.
