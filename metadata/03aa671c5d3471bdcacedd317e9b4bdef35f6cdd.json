With her brother&apos;s death, though devastated and in mourning, Reina is finally released from her prison vigil. Seeking anonymity, she moves to a sleepy town in the Florida Keys, where she meets Nesto Cadena, a recently exiled Cuban awaiting with hope the arrival of the children he left behind in Havana.\r\n\r\nThrough Nesto&apos;s love of the sea and capacity for faith, Reina comes to understand her own connections to the life-giving and destructive forces of the ocean that surrounds her as well as its role in her family&apos;s troubled history, and in their companionship she begins to find freedom from the burden of guilt she carries for her brother&apos;s crime.\r\n\r\nSet in the vibrant coastal and Caribbean communities of Miami; the Florida Keys; Havana, Cuba; and Cartagena, Colombia, with The Veins of the Ocean, Patricia Engel delivers a profound and riveting Pan-American story of fractured lives finding solace and redemption in the beauty and power of the natural world - and in one another.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-12-10T12:06:48.319Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:03aa671c5d3471bdcacedd317e9b4bdef35f6cdd","dn":"The Veins of the Ocean by Patricia Engel EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"03aa671c5d3471bdcacedd317e9b4bdef35f6cdd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,170,103,28,93,52,113,189,202,206,221,49,126,155,75,222,243,95,108,221]},"name":"The Veins of the Ocean by Patricia Engel EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
