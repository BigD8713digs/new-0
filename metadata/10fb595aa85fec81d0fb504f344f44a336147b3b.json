Steinbeck creates around the infamous Pippin the most hilarious royal court ever: Pippin&apos;s wife, Queen Marie, who &quot;might have taken her place at the bar of a very good restaurant&quot;; his uncle, a man of dubious virtue; his glamour-struck daughter and her beau, the son of the so-called &quot;egg king&quot; of Petaluma, California; and a motley crew of courtiers and politicians, guards and gardeners. This edition includes an introduction by Robert Morsberger and Katharine Morsberger.\n\nxx","last_updated":"2017-12-18T12:01:19.627Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:10fb595aa85fec81d0fb504f344f44a336147b3b","dn":"The Short Reign of Pippin IV by John Steinbeck EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"10fb595aa85fec81d0fb504f344f44a336147b3b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,251,89,90,168,95,236,129,208,251,80,79,52,79,68,163,54,20,123,59]},"name":"The Short Reign of Pippin IV by John Steinbeck EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
