Ganda, C. Alifirenka EPUB\r\n\r\nThe true story of an all-American girl and a boy from an impoverished city in Zimbabwe and the letter that changed both of their lives forever.\r\n\r\nIt started as an assignment. Everyone in Caitlin&apos;s class wrote to an unknown student somewhere in a distant place. All the other kids picked countries like France or Germany, but when Caitlin saw Zimbabwe written on the board, it sounded like the most exotic place she had ever heard of - so she chose it.\r\n\r\nMartin was lucky even to receive a pen-pal letter. There were only 10 letters and 40 kids in his class. But he was the top student, so he got the first one.\r\n\r\nThat letter was the beginning of a correspondence that spanned six years and changed two lives.\r\n\r\nIn this compelling dual memoir, Caitlin and Martin recount how they became best friends - and better people - through letters. Their story will inspire readers to look beyond their own lives and wonder about the world at large and their place in it.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-04-26T12:06:27.374Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:609347459ed241b0a1881a5cb22dc45a738b9737","dn":"I Will Always Write Back by M.
