With these very rich men leading the way, unions, libraries, public schools, common courtesy, and even government itself have been pushed aside to make way for supposedly efficient market-based encounters via the Internet.\r\n\r\nDonald Trump&apos;s election victory was an inadvertent triumph of the &quot;disruption&quot; that Silicon Valley has been pushing:and Twitter, eager to entertain their users, turned a blind eye to the fake news and the hateful ideas proliferating there. The Rust Belt states that shifted to Trump are the ones being left behind by a &quot;meritocratic&quot; Silicon Valley ideology that promotes an economy where, in the words of LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman, each of us is our own start-up. A society that belittles civility, empathy, and collaboration can easily be led astray. The Know-It-Alls explains how these self-proclaimed geniuses failed this most important test of democracy.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-11-07T12:02:37.206Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a6f0b93e87cb595387e5c6a7c0b3ca746219352","dn":"The Know-It-Alls_ The Rise of Silicon Valley by Noam Cohen EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"2a6f0b93e87cb595387e5c6a7c0b3ca746219352","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,111,11,147,232,124,181,149,56,126,92,106,124,11,60,167,70,33,147,82]},"name":"The Know-It-Alls_ The Rise of Silicon Valley by Noam Cohen EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
