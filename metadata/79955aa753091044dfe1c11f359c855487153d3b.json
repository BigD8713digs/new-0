Lee, Michael Korda, the New York Times best-selling biographer of Dwight D. Eisenhower, Ulysses S. Grant, and T. E. Lawrence, has written the first major biography of Lee in nearly 20 years, bringing to life America&apos;s greatest and most iconic hero. Korda paints a vivid and admiring portrait of Lee as a general and a devoted family man who, though he disliked slavery and was not in favor of secession, turned down command of the Union army in 1861 because he could not &quot;draw his sword&quot; against his own children, his neighbors, and his beloved Virginia. He was surely America&apos;s preeminent military leader, as calm, dignified, and commanding a presence in defeat as he was in victory. Lee&apos;s reputation has only grown in the 150 years since the Civil War, and Korda covers in groundbreaking detail all of Lee&apos;s battles and traces the making of a great man&apos;s undeniable reputation on both sides of the Mason-Dixon Line, positioning him finally as the symbolic martyr-hero of the Southern Cause.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-03-28T12:00:43.580Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:79955aa753091044dfe1c11f359c855487153d3b","dn":"Clouds of Glory by Michael Korda EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"79955aa753091044dfe1c11f359c855487153d3b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,149,90,167,83,9,16,68,223,225,193,31,53,156,133,84,135,21,61,59]},"name":"Clouds of Glory by Michael Korda EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
