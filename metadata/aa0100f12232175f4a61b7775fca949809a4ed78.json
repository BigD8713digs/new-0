With Habitat, Jensen joins the ranks of the large ensemble elite.\r\nJensen&apos;s inspirations come from different corners of the world, as she explores Afro-Peruvian ideals (&quot;Blue Yonder&quot;), expands on an idea born in Brooklyn (&quot;Sweet Adelphi&quot;), and reflects on her experiences in Haiti and the horrible earthquake that ravaged Port-au-Prince (&quot;Tumbledown&quot;). She manages to work with a global gaze, yet her music is spoken in a single language.\r\nAs of its release, Habitat is the clear frontrunner for large ensemble album of the year. Of course, the likelihood of the album and it&apos;s creator getting the same attention and credit as Schneider, Darcy James Argue, John Hollenbeck, and the like is slim, but that speaks to jazz&apos;s geographical biases rather than the merits of Christine Jensen and Habitat. - Dan Bilawsky, All About Jazz","last_updated":"2017-06-18T12:01:30.155Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa0100f12232175f4a61b7775fca949809a4ed78","dn":"Christine Jensen Jazz Orchestra 2013 Habitat","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"aa0100f12232175f4a61b7775fca949809a4ed78","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,1,0,241,34,50,23,95,74,97,183,119,95,202,148,152,9,164,237,120]},"name":"Christine Jensen Jazz Orchestra 2013 Habitat","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
