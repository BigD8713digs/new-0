Of the 108 Upanishads recognised and accepted as genuine by scholars, these 10 essential Upanishads have been extensively studied and interpreted upon by leading theologians including Mahatma Gandhi, Dr. Radhakrishnan, Rabindranath Tagore and Albert Einstein to name just a few.\r\n\r\nAn invaluable gift to humanity, the teachings contained in the Upanishads are relevant for all time. Since they are often in the form of lectures delivered by a teacher to a student, they inspired the &apos;Question-Answer&apos; format for this concise book. Easy to read, easier to understand &#x2013; The 10 Great Upanishads is a must read for those who want to benefit from the lessons the Upanishads have for everyone.\r\n\r\nPaperback: 148 pages\r\nPublisher: Yogi Impressions Books Pvt.
