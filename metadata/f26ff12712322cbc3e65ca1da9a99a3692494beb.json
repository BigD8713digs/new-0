Knowing your code through and through, it can boost your productivity with smart and relevant code completion, full coding assistance including customizable coding styles, keymaps and various project views, and instant navigation to a symbol&apos;s declaration or usages. \r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\nEasy start\r\nIt&#x2019;s surprisingly easy to start your CMake-based project in CLion, and files can be added to the project in one click.

Try smart completion, formatting and helpful views with code insight.\r\n\r\nNavigation &amp; Search\r\nFind your way through the code with instant navigation to a symbol, class or file. Inspect the calls or types hierarchy and easily search everywhere for nearly everything (including IDE settings).\r\n\r\nCode generation &amp; refactorings\r\nSave time on unnecessary typing while CLion generates code for you: from getters/setters to more complicated templates. Use refactorings to improve and clean up your code at the speed of thought.\r\n\r\nOn-the-fly code analysis\r\nWrite beautiful and correct code with CLion.
