A bagpipe CD is a particular challenge. A high beam spatial explorer, it is the kind of unstable phenomena that is hard to enjoyably reproduce on your stereo player. The first pipe recording session was an ensemble piece, the score including walks around the concert hall. The second, a solo multi-track session. The third with Rob Ramirez, recorded material was played back in the concert hall through an eight-channel MSP patch. A carnival of colliding pans, exits and entrances, re-recorded for stereo. For &apos;Sinister,&apos; an old cassette recorded at Amica Bunker was the original germ. A sequence of re-tuning and de-stringing, starting with six strings pitched across a whole-tone and ending with an improvisation on one string. This old piece was dusted off and reworked through an image of bell-ringing, another outdoors vernacular. -- David Watson","last_updated":"2017-08-12T12:00:56.336Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d2adff1ca2d6ddf9437e208dd27ca46825011ae","dn":"David Watson 2007 Fingering An Idea 2CD","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"3d2adff1ca2d6ddf9437e208dd27ca46825011ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,42,223,241,202,45,109,223,148,55,226,8,221,39,202,70,130,80,17,174]},"name":"David Watson 2007 Fingering An Idea 2CD","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
