It guides readers towards a richer understanding of the central concepts of classical Indian Buddhist thought, from the time of Buddha to the latest scholarly perspectives and controversies. Abstract and complex ideas are made understandable by the authors&apos; clear and engaging style. The second edition has been fully revised in light of new scholarship, in particular on Mah&#x101;y&#x101;na Buddhism and Tantric Buddhism, an often neglected and inadequately understood topic. As well as a detailed bibliography this authoritative resource now includes recommended further reading, study questions, a pronunciation guide and extensive glossary of terms, all aimed at helping students to develop their knowledge and appreciation of Buddhist thought.\r\n\r\nPaperback: 288 pages\r\nPublisher: Routledge; 2 edition (December 8, 2013)\r\nLanguage: English\r\nISBN-10: 0415571790\r\n <a href=\"\nhttps://www.amazon.co.uk/Buddhist-Thought-Complete-Introduction-Tradition/dp/0415571790\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://www.amazon.co.uk/Buddhist-Thought-Complete-Introduction-Tradition/dp/0415571790</a>","last_updated":"2018-08-20T12:01:47.002Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:e1b055d8b740e941e1aa45c9ebabc4dafc3cf5cd","dn":"Buddhist Thought: A Complete Introduction to the Indian Traditio","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"e1b055d8b740e941e1aa45c9ebabc4dafc3cf5cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,176,85,216,183,64,233,65,225,170,69,201,235,171,196,218,252,60,245,205]},"name":"Buddhist Thought: A Complete Introduction to the Indian Traditio","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
