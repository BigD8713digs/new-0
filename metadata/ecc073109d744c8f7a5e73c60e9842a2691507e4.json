Assiduously researched, deeply humane, and utterly definitive, Bloodlands will be required reading for anyone seeking to understand the central tragedy of modern history.\r\n\r\nBloodlands won twelve awards including the Emerson Prize in the Humanities, a Literature Award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, the Leipzig Award for European Understanding, and the Hannah Arendt Prize in Political Thought. It has been translated into more than thirty languages, was named to twelve book-of-the-year lists, and was a bestseller in six countries","last_updated":"2018-03-20T12:04:50.469Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:ecc073109d744c8f7a5e73c60e9842a2691507e4","dn":"Timothy Snyder Bloodlands.mobi","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"ecc073109d744c8f7a5e73c60e9842a2691507e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,192,115,16,157,116,76,143,122,94,115,198,14,152,66,162,105,21,7,228]},"name":"Timothy Snyder Bloodlands.mobi","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
