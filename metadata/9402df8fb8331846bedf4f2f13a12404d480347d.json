Now she is the only one with the power to face the darkness she unwittingly unleashed...right into the waiting hands of Tanith, the new Dragon Prince. Tanith has one goal in mind: destroy her enemies, raze their lands, and reign supreme in a new era where the Drakharin are almighty and the Avicen are nothing but a memory.\r\n\r\nThe war that has been brewing for centuries is finally imminent. But the scales are tipped. Echo might hold the power to face the darkness within the Dragon Prince, but she has far to go to master its overwhelming force. And now she&apos;s plagued by uncertainty. With Caius no longer by her side, she doesn&apos;t know if she can do it alone. Is she strong enough to save her home and the people she loves?\r\n\r\nWhether Echo is ready to face this evil is not the question. The war has begun, and there is no looking back. There are only two outcomes possible: triumph or death.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-05-07T12:05:44.104Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:9402df8fb8331846bedf4f2f13a12404d480347d","dn":"The Savage Dawn by Melissa Grey EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"9402df8fb8331846bedf4f2f13a12404d480347d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,2,223,143,184,51,24,70,190,223,79,47,19,161,36,4,212,128,52,125]},"name":"The Savage Dawn by Melissa Grey EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
