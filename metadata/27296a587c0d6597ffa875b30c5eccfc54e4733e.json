Always desperate for money, she&apos;s unscrupulous about how she gets it.\r\n\r\nNoel&apos;s mourning his godmother, Mattie, a former suffragette. Wise beyond his years, raised with a disdain for authority and an eclectic attitude toward education, he has little in common with other children and even less with the impulsive Vee, who hurtles from one self-made crisis to the next. The war&apos;s provided unprecedented opportunities for making money, but what Vee needs - and what she&apos;s never had - is a cool head and the ability to make a plan.\r\n\r\nOn her own she&apos;s a disaster. With Noel she&apos;s a team.\r\n\r\nTogether they cook up a scheme. Crisscrossing the bombed suburbs of London, Vee starts to make a profit, and Noel begins to regain his interest in life. But there are plenty of other people making money out of the war - and some of them are dangerous. Noel may have been moved to safety, but he isn&apos;t actually safe at all....\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-05-15T12:00:52.917Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:27296a587c0d6597ffa875b30c5eccfc54e4733e","dn":"Crooked Heart by Lissa Evans EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"27296a587c0d6597ffa875b30c5eccfc54e4733e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,41,106,88,124,13,101,151,255,168,117,179,12,94,204,252,84,228,115,62]},"name":"Crooked Heart by Lissa Evans EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
