He tries this on Raja Khanna alias Raja Dada, but in vain. When he comes to know his family, which consists of unmarried sister, Bharti, and an elderly and ailing mother, he decides that he must do something more to help Raja. Before he could think of anything, Raja is arrested for the murder of a police informer named Bichoo. Shankar destroys the evidence that links Raja to this murder, thus losing his job, facing criminal charges himself, and getting a jail sentence. When he comes out of jail, it is no longer the same Shankar - but one who is ready to join Raja as his criminal partner. But Raja is not the same petty criminal anymore - he has joined forces with international gangs of smugglers and may not quite be receptive to Shankar&apos;s request to join his gang. Shankar will now have to prove himself worthy of joining this ...\r\n\r\n\r\nFilm cast:      Shashi Kapoor, Neetu Singh, Vinod Khanna, Parveen Babi, Asrani, \r\n\r\n                Shabana Azmi, Kader Khan, Mac Mohan, Narendra Nath, Ranjeet, Om \r\n\r\n                Shiv Puri, Bhagwan, Leena Das, Durga Khote, Kishore Sahu\r\n\r\nSinger:         Asha Bhosle, Kishore Kumar, Lata Mangeshkar, Mohammed Rafi\r\n\r\nLyricist: \tAnand Bakshi\r\n\r\nMusic Director: Pyarelal, Laxmikant Kudalkar\r\n\r\nFilm Director: \tPrayagraj\r\n\r\nFilm Producer: \tShyam Sunder Shivadasani \r\n\r\nScreen///\r\n\r\n <a href=\"\nhttps://ibb.co/dFYzSv\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://ibb.co/dFYzSv</a>\r\n <a href=\"\nhttps://ibb.co/kvK67v\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://ibb.co/kvK67v</a>\r\n <a href=\"\nhttps://ibb.co/cRKHEa\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://ibb.co/cRKHEa</a>\r\n <a href=\"\nhttps://ibb.co/kTtoLF\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://ibb.co/kTtoLF</a>\r\n <a href=\"\nhttps://ibb.co/hK9CfF\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://ibb.co/hK9CfF</a>\r\n <a href=\"\nhttps://ibb.co/eG43LF\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://ibb.co/eG43LF</a>","last_updated":"2017-07-11T12:04:18.056Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:22070e849148273c6dfc7a1536004180afe26e9b","dn":"Chor Sipahee 1979-Hindi-(Shashi,Vinod,Shabana,Parveen)malikjee4","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"22070e849148273c6dfc7a1536004180afe26e9b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,7,14,132,145,72,39,60,109,252,122,21,54,0,65,128,175,226,110,155]},"name":"Chor Sipahee 1979-Hindi-(Shashi,Vinod,Shabana,Parveen)malikjee4","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
