Then the revolution happened, and everything changed.\r\n\r\nNow a powerful group called the Wolfpack controls the earth and its resources. Eden has lost everything to them. They killed her family and her friends, destroyed her home, and imprisoned her. But Eden refuses to die by their hands. She knows the coordinates to the only neutral ground left in the world, a place called Sanctuary Island, and she is desperate to escape to its shores.\r\n\r\nEden finally reaches the island and meets others resistant to the Wolves&#x2014;but the solace is short-lived when one of Eden&#x2019;s new friends goes missing. Braving the jungle in search of their lost ally, they quickly discover Sanctuary is filled with lethal traps and an enemy they never expected. \r\n\r\nThis island might be deadlier than the world Eden left behind, but surviving it is the only thing that stands between her and freedom","last_updated":"2017-08-04T12:00:58.616Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:29a6325ada825f843532c4e855fa5876690f08de","dn":"The Sandcastle Empire ~ Kayla Olson [Shades]epub","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"29a6325ada825f843532c4e855fa5876690f08de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,166,50,90,218,130,95,132,53,50,196,232,85,250,88,118,105,15,8,222]},"name":"The Sandcastle Empire ~ Kayla Olson [Shades]epub","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
