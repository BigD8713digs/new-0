But as she climbs the ladder of publishing success, she resolutely adheres to her father&apos;s admonition: men read crime thrillers by men only - and so Alexandra Winslow publishes under the pseudonym Alexander Green, her true identity known only to those closest to her and creating a double life that isolates her. Her secret life as the mysterious and brilliantly successful Alexander Green - and her own life as a talented young woman - expose her to the envious, the arrogant, and Hollywood players who have no idea who she really is. Always, the right time to open up seems just out of reach and would cost her dearly. Once her double life and fame are established, the price of the truth is always too high.\r\n&#xA9;2017 Danielle Steel (P)2017 Recorded Books","last_updated":"2017-09-20T12:11:13.057Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:981e41e2ba28b9138e18b85055c2f0078a644fd8","dn":"The Right Time audiobook by Danielle Steel [EarReaders]","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"981e41e2ba28b9138e18b85055c2f0078a644fd8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,30,65,226,186,40,185,19,142,24,184,80,85,194,240,7,138,100,79,216]},"name":"The Right Time audiobook by Danielle Steel [EarReaders]","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
