Through those letters, she enrolls in a kind of correspondence course, covering Socrates to Sartre, with a mysterious philosopher, while receiving letters addressed to another girl. Who is Hilde? And why does her mail keep turning up? To unravel this riddle, Sophie must use the philosophy she is learning - but the truth turns out to be far more complicated than she could have imagined.\r\n\r\nA riveting novel that is also an exploration of the great philosophical concepts of Western thought, Sophie&apos;s World, with more than 30 million copies in print, has fired the imaginations all over the world.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-09-30T12:03:32.949Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6bb1d224ea4a592bbca47718c750cfb8d57cb0c","dn":"Sophie's World by Jostein Gaarder EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"f6bb1d224ea4a592bbca47718c750cfb8d57cb0c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,187,29,34,78,164,165,146,187,202,71,113,140,117,12,251,141,87,203,12]},"name":"Sophie's World by Jostein Gaarder EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
