But it wasn&apos;t until she began studying the biblical texts in their original Hebrew and Greek - along with actually hiking the ancient paths of Israel - that she found the fulfillment of those desires.\r\n\r\nNow you can walk with Kathie on a journey through the spiritual foundations of her faith: \r\n\r\nThe Rock (Jesus Christ): Hear directly from Kathie about her life-changing and ever-deepening connection with Jesus, the Lover of her soul. \r\n\r\nThe Road (Israel): Explore dozens of ancient landmarks and historical sites from Israel, the promised land of God&apos;s covenant. \r\n\r\nThe Rabbi (God&apos;s Word): Go beyond a &quot;Sunday school&quot; approach to the Bible by digging into the original languages and deeper meanings of the Holy Scriptures. \r\n\r\nAs you journey through The Rock, The Road, and The Rabbi, you&apos;ll also find additional content from Messianic Rabbi Jason Sobel throughout the book. Jason&apos;s insight into the Hebrew language, culture, and heritage will open your eyes to the Bible like never before.\r\n\r\nCome! Begin your journey toward a deeper faith through The Rock, the Road, and the Rabbi.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-03-12T12:03:27.309Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:35b4693a76a661e41274cf49b8d37af2bc4eaf5a","dn":"The Rock, the Road, and the Rabbi by Kathie Lee Gifford EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"35b4693a76a661e41274cf49b8d37af2bc4eaf5a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,180,105,58,118,166,97,228,18,116,207,73,184,211,122,242,188,78,175,90]},"name":"The Rock, the Road, and the Rabbi by Kathie Lee Gifford EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
