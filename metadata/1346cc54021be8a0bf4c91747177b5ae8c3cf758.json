Hepburn: Beruseruku) is a Japanese dark fantasy manga series written and illustrated by Kentaro Miura. Set in a medieval Europe-inspired dark fantasy world, the story centers on the characters of Guts, a lone mercenary, and Griffith, the leader of a mercenary band called the &quot;Band of the Hawk&quot;. Themes of isolation, camaraderie, and the question of whether humanity is fundamentally good or evil pervade the story, as it explores both the best and worst of human nature. Both the manga and anime are noted for their use of graphic violence and sexual content.\r\n\r\nGuts (&#x30AC;&#x30C3;&#x30C4;? Gattsu) is a wandering mercenary whose entire world from birth is warfare and bloodshed. Born from a hanged corpse, the adoptive mother who rescued him dies from the plague when Guts is only two years old, and from then on Guts learns to fight in the mercenary band led by his adoptive father Gambino. Gambino is cruel to Guts even as he teaches the boy warfare, selling access to Guts to a rapist among the mercenaries and later attempting to murder Guts in a drunken rage. Guts flees after killing his adoptive father in self-defense","last_updated":"2017-05-31T11:05:01.447Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:1346cc54021be8a0bf4c91747177b5ae8c3cf758","dn":"Berserk Manga Complete Volumes 1 - 39  (Pdf, High Quality)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"1346cc54021be8a0bf4c91747177b5ae8c3cf758","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,70,204,84,2,27,232,160,191,76,145,116,113,119,181,174,140,60,247,88]},"name":"Berserk Manga Complete Volumes 1 - 39  (Pdf, High Quality)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
