Although a non-harmful cure (CBD) for many cancers has been discovered over a decade ago, big greedy pharmaceutical companies do not want us to use that or even know about it. They rather make their billions each year with toxic chemotherapy. And thus our loved ones keep on dying... while a cure is available.\r\n================================================================================\r\nKennedy Center Honors Carole King\r\nThe John F.
