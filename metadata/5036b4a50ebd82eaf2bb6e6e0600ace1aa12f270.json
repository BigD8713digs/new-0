At its helm, the mysterious Oyemi and her oracles seek out new recruits and root out evil plots. Then a prophecy suggests that someone from inside might bring about its downfall. And now the Regional Office is under attack.\r\n\r\nRecruited by a defector from within, Rose is a young assassin leading the attack, eager to stretch into her powers and prove herself on her first mission. Defending the Regional Office is Sarah, who may or may not have a mechanical arm and is fiercely devoted to the organization that took her in as a young woman in the wake of her mother&apos;s sudden disappearance. On the day that the Regional Office is attacked, Rose&apos;s and Sarah&apos;s stories will overlap, their lives will collide, and the world as they know it just might end.\r\n\r\nWeaving in a brilliantly conceived mythology, fantastical magical powers, teenage crushes, and kinetic fight scenes, The Regional Office Is Under Attack! is a seismically entertaining debut novel about revenge and allegiance and love.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-01-31T12:00:41.528Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:5036b4a50ebd82eaf2bb6e6e0600ace1aa12f270","dn":"The Regional Office Is Under Attack! by Manuel Gonzales EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"5036b4a50ebd82eaf2bb6e6e0600ace1aa12f270","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,54,180,165,14,189,130,234,242,187,110,110,6,0,172,225,170,18,242,112]},"name":"The Regional Office Is Under Attack! by Manuel Gonzales EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
