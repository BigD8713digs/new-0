Unlike other books that may focus on one specific addiction, this book covers a wide range of addictions in adolescents, including alcohol, cannabis, tobacco, eating, gambling, internet and video games, and sex addiction. Organized into three sections, the book begins with the classification and assessment of adolescent addiction. Section two has one chapter each on the aforementioned addictions, discussing for each the definition, epidemiology, risk factors, co-morbidity, course and outcome, and prevention and intervention. Section three discusses the assessment and treatment of co-morbid conditions in greater detail as well as the social and political implications of adolescent addictions.\r\n\r\nIntended to be of practical use to clinicians treating adolescent addiction, the book contains a wealth of information that will be of use to the researcher as well. Contributors to the book represent the US, Canada, the UK, New Zealand, and Australia","last_updated":"2017-06-23T12:00:25.130Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:389db40f0e26f74eb154857ee4c92be29c65d485","dn":"Adolescent Addiction - Epidemiology, Assessment, and Treatment","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"389db40f0e26f74eb154857ee4c92be29c65d485","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,157,180,15,14,38,247,78,177,84,133,126,228,201,43,226,156,101,212,133]},"name":"Adolescent Addiction - Epidemiology, Assessment, and Treatment","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
