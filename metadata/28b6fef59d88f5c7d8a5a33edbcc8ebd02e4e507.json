By the 10th century, England was a nation-state whose people were already starting to define themselves with reference to inherited common-law rights. The story of liberty is the story of how that model triumphed: How it was enshrined in a series of landmark victories - the Magna Carta, the English Civil War, the Glorious Revolution, the US Constitution - and how it came to defeat every international rival.\r\n\r\nToday we see those ideas abandoned and scorned in the places where they once went unchallenged. Inventing Freedom is a chronicle of the success of Anglosphere exceptionalism, and it is offered at a time that may turn out to be the end of the age of political freedom.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-11-04T12:01:26.429Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:28b6fef59d88f5c7d8a5a33edbcc8ebd02e4e507","dn":"Inventing Freedom by Daniel Hannan EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"28b6fef59d88f5c7d8a5a33edbcc8ebd02e4e507","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,182,254,245,157,136,245,199,216,165,163,62,219,204,142,189,2,228,229,7]},"name":"Inventing Freedom by Daniel Hannan EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
