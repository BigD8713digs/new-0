Windows, by design, allows programs to monopolize your CPU without restraint &#x2014; leading to freezes and hangs. Process Lasso&#x2019;s ProBalance (Process Balance) technology intelligently adjusts the priority of running programs so that badly behaved or overly active processes won&#x2019;t interfere with your ability to use the computer!\r\n\r\nProcess Lasso also offers an assortment of ways to take full control of how your CPUs are allocated to running programs. You can choose at what priority processes should run, and which CPUs (cores) should be assigned to them. You can also disallow certain programs from running, log all programs run, and so much more (see list below).\r\n\r\nOnce you install Process Lasso, it&#x2019;ll just start working. More advanced users can tweak the configuration, but you needn&#x2019;t touch anything to have it instantly improve your system responsiveness and prevent stalls in high load situations.\r\n\r\nFor network admins, Proces Lasso works wonderfully on Terminal Servers and in multi-user environments. We have many clients that have been using Process Lasso on their Terminal Servers for years.\r\n\r\nBest of all, Process Lasso is written in native C++, not .NET. This means it consumes very few system resources &#x2013; considerably less than any similar software","last_updated":"2018-10-12T12:20:07.250Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:63662fe45029c77a2bd436ffa16b62c7c4b7237e","dn":"Bitsum Technologies Process Lasso Pro 9.0.0.498 Multilingual Ful","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"63662fe45029c77a2bd436ffa16b62c7c4b7237e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,102,47,228,80,41,199,122,43,212,54,255,161,107,98,199,196,183,35,126]},"name":"Bitsum Technologies Process Lasso Pro 9.0.0.498 Multilingual Ful","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
