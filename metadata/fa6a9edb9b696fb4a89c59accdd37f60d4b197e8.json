As a member of the Skverers, one of the most insular Hasidic sects in the US, he knows little about the outside world - only that it is to be shunned. His marriage at 18 is arranged, and several children soon follow.\r\n\r\nDeen&apos;s first transgression - turning on the radio - is small, but his curiosity leads him to the library and, later, the Internet. Soon he begins a feverish inquiry into the tenets of his religious beliefs until, several years later, his faith unravels entirely. Now a heretic, he fears being discovered and ostracized from the only world he knows. His relationship with his family at stake, he is forced into a life of deception and begins a long struggle to hold on to those he loves most: his five children.\r\n\r\nIn All Who Go Do Not Return, Deen bravely traces his harrowing loss of faith while offering an illuminating look at a highly secretive world.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-07-03T12:13:55.153Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa6a9edb9b696fb4a89c59accdd37f60d4b197e8","dn":"All Who Go Do Not Return: A Memoir by Shulem Deen AZW","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"fa6a9edb9b696fb4a89c59accdd37f60d4b197e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,106,158,219,155,105,111,180,168,156,89,172,205,211,127,96,212,177,151,232]},"name":"All Who Go Do Not Return: A Memoir by Shulem Deen AZW","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
