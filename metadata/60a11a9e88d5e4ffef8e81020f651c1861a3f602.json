The Rebellion has learned of a sinister Imperial plot to bring entire worlds to their knees. Deep in Empire-dominated space, a machine of unimaginable destructive power is nearing completion. A weapon too terrifying to contemplate...and a threat that may be too great to overcome.\r\n\r\nIf the worlds at the Empire&apos;s mercy stand any chance, it lies with an unlikely band of allies: Jyn Erso, a resourceful young woman seeking vengeance; Cassian Andor, a war-weary rebel commander; Bodhi Rook, a defector from the Empire&apos;s military; Chirrut &#xCE;mwe, a blind holy man; his crack-shot companion, Baze Malbus; and K-2SO, a deadly Imperial droid turned against its former masters. In their hands rests the new hope that could turn the tide toward a crucial Rebellion victory - if only they can capture the plans to the Empire&apos;s new weapon.\r\n\r\nBut even as they race toward their dangerous goal, the specter of their ultimate enemy - a monstrous world unto itself - darkens the skies. Waiting to herald the Empire&apos;s brutal reign with a burst of annihilation worthy of its dreaded name: Death Star.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-10-23T12:01:19.278Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:60a11a9e88d5e4ffef8e81020f651c1861a3f602","dn":"Rogue One_ A Star Wars Story by Alexander Freed EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"60a11a9e88d5e4ffef8e81020f651c1861a3f602","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,161,26,158,136,213,228,255,239,142,129,2,15,101,28,24,97,163,246,2]},"name":"Rogue One_ A Star Wars Story by Alexander Freed EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
