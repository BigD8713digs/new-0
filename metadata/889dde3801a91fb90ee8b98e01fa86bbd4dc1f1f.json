Amadou &amp; Mariam fetish couple, are project ambassadors for solidarity and fight against hunger in Africa. All their songs link us to Malian culture, the country where they are born. The songs are all as much revendicatives, denouncing corruption, poverty and injustice that reign in some African countries. Their set knew how to create an atmosphere and a perfect communion with the audience. AMADOU &amp; MARIAM enabled the BALOISE SESSION public to have a better understanding of the Malian culture specificity. With them, we would be delighted to leave &#x201C;on a Sunday Bamako&#x201D;!\r\n\r\nSetlist:\r\n1. La Confusion\r\n2. Filaou Bessame\r\n3. Bofou Safou\r\n4. La R&#xE9;alit&#xE9;\r\n5. Sabali\r\n6.
