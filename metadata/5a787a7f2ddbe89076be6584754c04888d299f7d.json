The question of why there is pain and suffering in the world has confounded every generation; yet there has not been a major book from a Christian perspective exploring why they exist for many years.\r\n\r\nThe two classics in this area are When Bad Things Happen to Good People by Rabbi Harold S. Kushner, which was published more than thirty years ago, and C. S. Lewis&#x2019;s The Problem of Pain, published more than seventy years ago. The great secular book on the subject, Elisabeth Ku&#xA8;bler-Ross&#x2019;s On Death and Dying, was first published in 1969. It&#x2019;s time for a new understanding and perspective, and who better to tackle this complex subject than Timothy Keller?\r\n\r\nAs the pastor of Redeemer Presbyterian Church in Manhattan, Timothy Keller is known for the unique insights he shares, and his series of books has guided countless readers in their spiritual journeys. Walking with God through Pain and Suffering will bring a much-needed, fresh viewpoint on this important issue.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-11-05T12:01:30.642Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a787a7f2ddbe89076be6584754c04888d299f7d","dn":"Walking with God through Pain / Suffering by Timothy Keller EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"5a787a7f2ddbe89076be6584754c04888d299f7d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,120,122,127,45,219,232,144,118,190,101,132,117,76,4,136,141,41,159,125]},"name":"Walking with God through Pain / Suffering by Timothy Keller EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
