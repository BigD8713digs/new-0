His particular tragedy waited until he was primed to lose it all: In one spectacular night, a reckless driver shatters Ezra&apos;s knee, his athletic career, and his social life.\r\n\r\nNo longer a front-runner for Homecoming King, Ezra finds himself at the table of misfits, where he encounters new girl Cassidy Thorpe. Cassidy is unlike anyone Ezra&apos;s ever met - achingly effortless and fiercely intelligent.\r\n\r\nTogether, Ezra and Cassidy discover flash mobs, buried treasure, and a poodle that might just be the reincarnation of Jay Gatsby. But as Ezra dives into his new studies, new friendships, and new love, he learns that some people, like books, are easy to misread. And now he must consider: If one&apos;s singular tragedy has already hit, what happens when more misfortune strikes?\r\n\r\nRobyn Schneider&apos;s The Beginning of Everything is a lyrical, witty, and heart-wrenching novel about how difficult it is to play the part that people expect, and how new beginnings can stem from abrupt and tragic endings.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-08-20T12:00:42.287Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ba1692f771be39220e0c664f345d77e330deb70","dn":"The Beginning of Everything by Robyn Schneider ePUB eBOOK-ZAK","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"6ba1692f771be39220e0c664f345d77e330deb70","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,161,105,47,119,27,227,146,32,224,198,100,243,69,215,126,51,13,235,112]},"name":"The Beginning of Everything by Robyn Schneider ePUB eBOOK-ZAK","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
