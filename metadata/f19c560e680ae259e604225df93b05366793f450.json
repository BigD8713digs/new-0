His goal, like that of every fighter pilot, is to chalk up enough kills to become an ace. But things do not turn out as expected.\r\n\r\nMission after mission proves fruitless, and Connell finds his ability and his stomach for combat questioned by his fellow airmen: the brash wing commander, Imil; Captain Robey, an ace whose record is suspect; and finally, Lieutenant Pell, a cocky young pilot with an uncanny amount of skill and luck.\r\n\r\nDisappointment and fear gradually erode Connell&apos;s faith in himself, and his dream of making ace seems to slip out of reach. Then suddenly, one dramatic mission above the Yalu River reveals the depth of his courage and honor.\r\n\r\nOriginally published in 1956, The Hunters was James Salter&apos;s first novel. Based on his own experiences as a fighter pilot in the Korean War, it is a classic of wartime fiction.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-06-17T12:02:53.846Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:f19c560e680ae259e604225df93b05366793f450","dn":"The Hunters by James Salter EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"f19c560e680ae259e604225df93b05366793f450","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,156,86,14,104,10,226,89,230,4,34,93,249,59,5,54,103,147,244,80]},"name":"The Hunters by James Salter EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
