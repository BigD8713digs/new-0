He practiced and practiced, but by the time he was 15, he realized there was no place for a slow, white Jewish kid in the NBA. So he found another way to channel his obsession with sports: talking trash.\r\n\r\nIn This Book Has Balls, Rapaport uses his signature smack-talk style and in-your-face humor to discuss everything from why LeBron will never be like Mike to how Tiger needs the ladies to get his golf game back and how he once thought Mary Lou Retton was his true love. And, of course, why next year will be the year the New York Knicks win the championship. This book is a series of rants - some controversial, some affectionate, but all incredibly hilarious.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-11-17T12:00:38.730Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c7d10f4c97650c5ea633d813b0b927f02926b89","dn":"This Book Has Balls by Michael Rapaport EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"2c7d10f4c97650c5ea633d813b0b927f02926b89","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,125,16,244,201,118,80,197,234,99,61,129,59,11,146,127,2,146,107,137]},"name":"This Book Has Balls by Michael Rapaport EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
