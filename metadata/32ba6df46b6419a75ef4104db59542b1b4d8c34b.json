She can cripple mainframes and crash through firewalls, but that&#x2019;s not what makes her special. In Cat&#x2019;s world, people are implanted with technology to recode their DNA, allowing them to change their bodies in any way they want. And Cat happens to be a gene-hacking genius.\r\n\r\nThat&#x2019;s no surprise, since Cat&#x2019;s father is Dr. Lachlan Agatta, a legendary geneticist who may be the last hope for defeating a plague that has brought humanity to the brink of extinction. But during the outbreak, Lachlan was kidnapped by a shadowy organization called Cartaxus, leaving Cat to survive the last two years on her own.\r\n\r\nWhen a Cartaxus soldier, Cole, arrives with news that her father has been killed, Cat&#x2019;s instincts tell her it&#x2019;s just another Cartaxus lie. But Cole also brings a message: before Lachlan died, he managed to create a vaccine, and Cole needs Cat&#x2019;s help to release it and save the human race.\r\n\r\nNow Cat must decide who she can trust: The soldier with secrets of his own? The father who made her promise to hide from Cartaxus at all costs? In a world where nature itself can be rewritten, how much can she even trust herself?\r\n\r\nGenre: Fiction &gt; Mystery &amp; Thriller","last_updated":"2018-11-03T12:19:58.276Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:32ba6df46b6419a75ef4104db59542b1b4d8c34b","dn":"This Mortal Coil by Emily Suvada (.epub)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"32ba6df46b6419a75ef4104db59542b1b4d8c34b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,186,109,244,107,100,25,167,94,244,16,77,181,149,66,177,180,216,195,75]},"name":"This Mortal Coil by Emily Suvada (.epub)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
