This selection from the Subh&#xE2;shit&#xE2;vali, a celebrated verse anthology compiled by Vallabhadeva in c. fifteenth-century Kashmir, offers a rich variety of erotic poetry and a wealth of lyrical and gnomic verse. One section is given to earthy humour and cynical satire seldom available in English renditions. Also included are invocations and\r\n\r\nallegories, panegyrics and pen-pictures, sage observations and stark musings. The sweep of these verses is matched by the eclectic array of contributors-from illustrious poets like Vyasa and Valmiki,\r\n\r\nKalidasa and Bana to others now mostly forgotten.\r\n\r\n\r\nPaperback: 208 pages\r\nPublisher: Penguin Classics (25 Oct. 2012)\r\nLanguage: English\r\nISBN-10: 0143101366\r\nISBN-13: 978-0143101369","last_updated":"2017-07-01T12:01:53.129Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:c1f12b5c67110109b2b761db1b1fd7cebba0cfc6","dn":"Subhashitavali: An Anthology of Comic, Erotic and Other Verse ","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"c1f12b5c67110109b2b761db1b1fd7cebba0cfc6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,241,43,92,103,17,1,9,178,183,97,219,27,31,215,206,187,160,207,198]},"name":"Subhashitavali: An Anthology of Comic, Erotic and Other Verse ","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
