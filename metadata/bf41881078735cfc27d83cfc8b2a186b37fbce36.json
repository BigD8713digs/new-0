His newest book is an utter flop, the critics have turned against him, relatives near and far hound him for money. While his wife plans a lavish holiday party for their ever-expanding family and circle of friends, Dickens has visions of the poor house. But when his publishers try to blackmail him into writing a Christmas book to save them all from financial ruin, he refuses. And a serious bout of writer&apos;s block sets in. Frazzled and filled with self-doubt, Dickens seeks solace in his great palace of thinking, the city of London itself. On one of his long night walks in a once-beloved square, he meets the mysterious Eleanor Lovejoy, who might be just the muse he needs. As Dickens&apos; deadlines close in, Eleanor propels him on a Scrooge-like journey that tests everything he believes about generosity, friendship, ambition, and love. The story he writes will change Christmas forever.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-10-31T12:01:12.186Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf41881078735cfc27d83cfc8b2a186b37fbce36","dn":"Mr. Dickens and His Carol by Samantha Silva EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"bf41881078735cfc27d83cfc8b2a186b37fbce36","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,65,136,16,120,115,92,252,39,216,60,252,139,42,24,107,55,251,206,54]},"name":"Mr. Dickens and His Carol by Samantha Silva EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
