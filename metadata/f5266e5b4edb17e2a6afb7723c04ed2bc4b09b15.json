The problem goes beyond banks deemed Too Big to Fail to almost every large corporation, including  American pharmaceutical companies and auto manufacturers and beyond.\r\n\r\n The Chickenshit Cluban inside reference to prosecutors too scared of failure and too daunted by legal impediments to do their jobsexplains why.\r\n\r\n A character-driven narrative, the book tells the story from inside the Department of Justice. The complex and richly reported story spans the last decade and a half of prosecutorial fiascos, corporate lobbying, trial losses, and culture shifts that have stripped the government of the will and ability to prosecute top corporate executives.\r\n\r\n The book begins in the 1970s, when the government pioneered the notion that top corporate executives, not just seedy crooks, could commit heinous crimes and go to prison. The book travels to trading desks on Wall Street, to corporate boardrooms and the offices of prosecutors and F.B.I agents.\r\n\r\n These revealing looks provide context for the evolution of the Justice Departments approach to pursuing corporate criminals through the early days and into the Justice Department of today. \r\n\r\nExposing one of the most important scandals of our time, The Chickenshit Club provides a clear, detailed explanation as to how our Justice Department has come to avoid, bungle, and mismanage the fight to bring these alleged criminals to justice","last_updated":"2017-07-11T12:00:23.249Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5266e5b4edb17e2a6afb7723c04ed2bc4b09b15","dn":"The Chickenshi: Why the Justice Department Fails to Prosec","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"f5266e5b4edb17e2a6afb7723c04ed2bc4b09b15","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,38,110,91,78,219,23,226,166,175,183,114,60,4,237,43,196,176,155,21]},"name":"The Chickenshi: Why the Justice Department Fails to Prosec","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
