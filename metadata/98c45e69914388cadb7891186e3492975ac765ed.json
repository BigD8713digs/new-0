Gautam, M.C. Chattopadhyaya (BH, 2016).pdf\r\n\r\nNanomaterials for Wastewater Remediation introduces techniques for nanoparticle formation and their benefits in environmental cleanup, as well as their recent advances and applications in wastewater treatment. The book follows a sequential approach for the treatment of wastewater, presenting state-of-the-art techniques for the characterization and measurement of nanomaterials.\r\n\r\nNanoparticles represent a promising new technology for wastewater remediation, not only because of their high treatment efficiency, but also for their cost effectiveness, as they have the flexibility for in situ and ex situ applications. New methods for developing nanomaterials with less environmental risk are described. Nanomaterials such as magnetic nanoparticles and graphene-based nanocomposites are discussed in detail. Also includes in-depth analyses of the ecotoxicological impacts of nanomaterials and the latest findings on the transport and fate of nanomaterials in the environment.\r\n\r\nCovers methods for the characterization of nanomaterials using advanced instrumental techniques\r\nIncludes innovative methods for developing new nanomaterials while lessening their environmental risk\r\nProvides the latest methods for determining the transport and fate of nanomaterials in the environment\r\nDiscusses in detail nanomaterials such as magnetic nanoparticles and graphene-based nanocomposites","last_updated":"2017-06-08T12:00:44.387Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:98c45e69914388cadb7891186e3492975ac765ed","dn":"Nanomaterials for Wastewater Remediation","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"98c45e69914388cadb7891186e3492975ac765ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,196,94,105,145,67,136,202,219,120,145,24,110,52,146,151,90,199,101,237]},"name":"Nanomaterials for Wastewater Remediation","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
