Nahin [epub]\r\n\r\nBoolean algebra, also called Boolean logic, is at the heart of the electronic circuitry in everything we use&#x2015;from our computers and cars, to home appliances. How did a system of mathematics established in the Victorian era become the basis for such incredible technological achievements a century later?\r\n\r\nIn The Logician and the Engineer, Paul Nahin combines engaging problems and a colorful historical narrative to tell the remarkable story of how two men in different eras&#x2015;mathematician and philosopher George Boole and electrical engineer and pioneering information theorist Claude Shannon&#x2015;advanced Boolean logic and became founding fathers of the electronic communications age. Nahin takes readers from fundamental concepts to a deeper and more sophisticated understanding of modern digital machines, in order to explore computing and its possible limitations in the twenty-first century and beyond.\r\n\r\nHardcover: 248 pages\r\nPublisher: Princeton University Press (October 28, 2012)","last_updated":"2018-01-01T12:04:27.173Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2b3a9255115012200ae850d73260f8132addbbe","dn":"The Logician and the Engineer: George Boole and Claude Shannon","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"f2b3a9255115012200ae850d73260f8132addbbe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,179,169,37,81,21,1,34,0,174,133,13,115,38,15,129,50,173,219,190]},"name":"The Logician and the Engineer: George Boole and Claude Shannon","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
