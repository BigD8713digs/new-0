And God, there were terrible things.&#x201D; It&#x2019;s about her childhood in the northwest of England with her beautiful, careworn mother Marcia; the man formerly known as Dad (half fun, half frightening); and her little brother Roo, who sees things written in the stars.\r\n \r\nIt&#x2019;s also about the surreal magic of adolescence, about growing up and discovering the power and fear of sexuality, about pitch-gray days of pills and powder and connection. It&#x2019;s about damage and pain, but also joy. Told with raw intensity and shocking honesty, The Terrible is a memoir of going under, losing yourself, and finding your voice","last_updated":"2018-09-19T12:16:49.290Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:4aabfcc8121be7fd7640ccf63768c53fa74fa57a","dn":"Yrsa Daley-Ward - The Terrible- A Storyteller's Memoir (epub)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"4aabfcc8121be7fd7640ccf63768c53fa74fa57a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,171,252,200,18,27,231,253,118,64,204,246,55,104,197,63,167,79,165,122]},"name":"Yrsa Daley-Ward - The Terrible- A Storyteller's Memoir (epub)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
