Many chapters underline the difficulty of increasing well-being in developing countries, including China, even in the presence of sustained income growth. This is notably due to the importance of income comparisons to others, adaptation (so that we get used to higher income), and the growing inequality of income. In particular, rank in the local income distribution is shown to be important, creating a beggar-thy-neighbour effect in happiness. Wealth comparisons in China are exacerbated by the gender imbalance, as the competition for brides creates a striking phenomenon of conspicuous consumption on the housing market. \r\n\r\n---\r\n <a href=\"\nhttp://dlfeb.com/book/happiness-and-economic-growth-lessons-from-developing-countries-studies-of-policy-reform/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttp://dlfeb.com/book/happiness-and-economic-growth-lessons-from-developing-countries-studies-of-policy-reform/</a>","last_updated":"2017-07-23T12:01:31.388Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:68cf85b99ec295c87282134aa072e2ecbd1b0a77","dn":"HAPPINESS AND ECONOMIC GROWTH: LESSONS FROM DEVELOPING COUNTRIES","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"68cf85b99ec295c87282134aa072e2ecbd1b0a77","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,207,133,185,158,194,149,200,114,130,19,74,160,114,226,236,189,27,10,119]},"name":"HAPPINESS AND ECONOMIC GROWTH: LESSONS FROM DEVELOPING COUNTRIES","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
