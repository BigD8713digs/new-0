Yet as the evolution present in that band&#x2019;s post-hiatus output and his own solo recordings suggest, that sole accolade is a reductive view of a rich and varied career. 2017 was a characteristically busy year for Carlson and saw Earth release a collaborative record with experimental electronic artist the Bug and a live album recorded at Jack White&#x2019;s Third Man Studios. The previous year, as Drcarlsonalbion, he released the solo record Falling with a 1000 Stars and Other Wonders from the House of Albion (with Coleman Grey), on which he indulged his interest in English folklore. For his first recording under his own name, Carlson returns to the American influences that pervaded 2014&#x2019;s Gold for a distinctly scorched desert vibe. \r\nThe record opens with the circular title track, which builds a roaming, distorted guitar line that eventually overwhelms the main riff. Within these repetitions, and a 13-plus-minute running time, Carlson builds a foreboding tension and an exposition shot that is so evocative of dusty landscapes, blinding rays, and dry heat it conjures visceral visions. The imagery and ambiance build over the arc of the album, from the sun-bleached, bluesy tilt of &#x201C;When the Horses Were Shorn of The&#x201D; through the creepy, insect-infested interlude &#x201C;And Then the Crows Descend,&#x201D; creating a thoroughly immersive world. As was often noted about Gold, it&#x2019;s a world that rejects Hollywood&#x2019;s fetishization of western mythology for a revisionism more closely linked to the bleak perspective of Cormac McCarthy&#x2019;s writing. \r\n \r\nTracklist: \r\n01 - Conquistador.flac \r\n02 - When the Horses Were Shorn of Their Hooves.flac \r\n03 - And Then the Crows Descended.flac \r\n04 - Scorpions in Their Mouths.flac \r\n05 - Reaching the Gulf.flac \r\n\r\nSummary: \r\nCountry: USA \r\nGenre: alternative rock, post-rock","last_updated":"2018-06-02T12:01:26.497Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:99d35929cc16d0d8eb69fdd25a52f010fae8762c","dn":"[alternative rock, post-rock] (2018) Dylan Carlson - Conquistado","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"99d35929cc16d0d8eb69fdd25a52f010fae8762c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,211,89,41,204,22,208,216,235,105,253,210,90,82,240,16,250,232,118,44]},"name":"[alternative rock, post-rock] (2018) Dylan Carlson - Conquistado","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
