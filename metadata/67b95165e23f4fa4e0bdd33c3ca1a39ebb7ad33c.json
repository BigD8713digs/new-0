It is a lonely job, and a thankless one for the most part. Until something goes wrong. Until a ship is in distress.\r\n\r\nIn the 23rd century, this job has moved into outer space. A network of beacons allows ships to travel across the Milky Way at many times the speed of light. These beacons are built to be robust. They never break down. They never fail.\r\n\r\nAt least, they aren&#x2019;t supposed to.\r\n\r\n\r\nRead by: Ryan McCarthy\r\n\r\nFormat: Stereo mp3\r\n\r\nBit Rate: 128Kbps/44.1Hz","last_updated":"2018-01-22T21:40:39.796Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:67b95165e23f4fa4e0bdd33c3ca1a39ebb7ad33c","dn":"Beacon 23 - Hugh Howey","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"67b95165e23f4fa4e0bdd33c3ca1a39ebb7ad33c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,185,81,101,226,63,79,164,224,189,211,60,60,161,163,158,187,122,211,60]},"name":"Beacon 23 - Hugh Howey","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
