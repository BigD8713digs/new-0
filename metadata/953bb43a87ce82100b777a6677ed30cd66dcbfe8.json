I hope these battle tactics help you win the war in your minds. All of you have my full support, and I wish you all the best of luck.\r\n\r\nWe will confront the nine most common mental illnesses; Depression, Anxiety, Bipolar, ADHD, Schizophrenia, OCD, Autism, PTSD, and Dementia. It is my sincere hope that the battle strategies I have developed will help you, or a loved one, through your trauma.\r\n\r\nMental Illness is trauma. Medication helps manage the trauma, but it does not resolve it. To do this, you need to go to war with your own mind, and these pages detail the methods I have learned","last_updated":"2017-11-12T12:04:18.449Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:953bb43a87ce82100b777a6677ed30cd66dcbfe8","dn":"Mental Health The Nine Types","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"953bb43a87ce82100b777a6677ed30cd66dcbfe8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,59,180,58,135,206,130,16,11,119,122,102,119,237,48,205,102,220,191,232]},"name":"Mental Health The Nine Types","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
