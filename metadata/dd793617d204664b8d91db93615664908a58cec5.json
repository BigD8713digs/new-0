As he soon understood, this detachment was a crucial survival strategy. In a profession where failure is literally a heartbeat away and the cost of that failure is death, how else could he live with the consequences of his performance?\r\n\r\nIn Open Heart, Westaby reflects on over 11,000 surgeries, showing us why the procedures have never become routine and will never be. With astonishing compassion and candor, Dr. Westaby recounts the fraught and alarming stories from his operating room: We meet a pulseless man who lives with an electric heart pump, an expecting mother who refuses surgery unless the doctors let her pregnancy reach full term, and a baby who gets a transplanted heart - only to die once it&apos;s in place. Open Heart offers unforgettable insight into how to push back death until nothing is left to do but to accept it.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-08-31T12:00:32.838Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd793617d204664b8d91db93615664908a58cec5","dn":"Open Heart_ A Cardiac Surgeons Stories of Life and Death on the ","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"dd793617d204664b8d91db93615664908a58cec5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,121,54,23,210,4,102,75,141,145,219,147,97,86,100,144,138,88,206,197]},"name":"Open Heart_ A Cardiac Surgeons Stories of Life and Death on the ","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
