Saxophonist, pianist, and composer Giuseppi Logan has been completely off the radar since the 1970s after recording a pair of brilliant albums for ESP -- the last of which was 45 years ago! -- until he was discovered playing &quot;Begin the Beguine&quot; in Tompkins Square Park for tips. His story is incredible; in short, after being beset by personal problems, he&#x2019;d been away from music entirely, homeless, and living in institutions, shelters, and on the streets for decades; he was thought to be dead....\r\nBy any measure, The Giuseppi Logan Quintet is an astonishing comeback record because of its sheer virtuosic facility, Logan&apos;s composing and playing so finely wrought, it&apos;s as if he never left! With this fine band behind him, we can only hope there is much more to come from him. - Thom Jurek, AMG","last_updated":"2017-07-22T12:01:15.141Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:7135c72e491f962c030b0bf495d92601e93aef61","dn":"The Giuseppi Logan Quintet 2010","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"7135c72e491f962c030b0bf495d92601e93aef61","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,53,199,46,73,31,150,44,3,11,11,244,149,217,38,1,233,58,239,97]},"name":"The Giuseppi Logan Quintet 2010","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
