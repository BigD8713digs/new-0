His department is facing draconian cuts and squalid quarters, while one floor above them the Economics Department is getting lavishly remodeled offices. His once-promising writing career is in the doldrums, as is his romantic life, in part as the result of his unwise use of his private affairs for his novels. His star (he thinks) student can&apos;t catch a break with his brilliant (he thinks) work Accountant in a Bordello, based on Melville&apos;s Bartleby. \r\n\r\nIn short, his life is a tale of woe, and the vehicle this droll and inventive book uses to tell that tale is a series of hilarious letters of recommendation that Fitger is endlessly called upon by his students and colleagues to produce, each one of which is a small masterpiece of high dudgeon, low spirits, and passive-aggressive strategies. We recommend Dear Committee Members to you in the strongest possible terms. \r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-09-07T12:02:16.709Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:35dad2f08a34ded2bcc966cd684d868d0d9b68d4","dn":"Dear Committee Members by Julie Schumacher EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"35dad2f08a34ded2bcc966cd684d868d0d9b68d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,218,210,240,138,52,222,210,188,201,102,205,104,77,134,141,13,155,104,212]},"name":"Dear Committee Members by Julie Schumacher EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
