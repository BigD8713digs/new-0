In the growing backlash, concerned cooks are looking for ways to wean themselves and their children from these diet disasters without making anyone feel deprived.\r\nHomemade Snacks and Staples gives more than 200 recipes that enable readers to skip the processed foods. That same creative spirit that inspires them to make homemade baked goods and snacks spills over into other areas of their pantry and fridge, including yogurt and butter, fruit popsicles, spice mixes, condiments, peanut butter, breads and tortillas, and sauces and dressings. As a bonus, these recipes are mindful of vegan values and provide optional vegan variations. In addition to avoiding harmful additives, buyers will be motivated by the lower costs of making their own staples and lessening their impact on the environment","last_updated":"2017-08-24T12:00:37.625Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:e777260ba91ffc61bb2629c8748ae0364c28a9bd","dn":"Homemade Snacks &amp; Staples ~ Kimberly Aime [Shades]pdf","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"e777260ba91ffc61bb2629c8748ae0364c28a9bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,119,38,11,169,31,252,97,187,38,41,200,116,138,224,54,76,40,169,189]},"name":"Homemade Snacks &amp; Staples ~ Kimberly Aime [Shades]pdf","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
