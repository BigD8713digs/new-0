This time, both Harris&#x2019;s voice and piano are drenched in lush, shimmering reverb, taking things into more abstract territory than what&#x2019;s on offer on Ruins, voice and keystrokes alike gliding over all with drifty elusion. Nevertheless, the only moment requiring Harris to reach beyond the keys comes with a fade-in to a field recording of a passing train (presumably a &#x201C;Coal Train,&#x201D; given an earlier track listing for this release) halfway through album closer &#x201C;Breathing,&#x201D; and that moment of chugging industrial evanescence speaks to the simultaneous immediacy and temporary circumstances of the sessions that produced these scenes. \r\nWritten and recorded over a week-and-a-half-long period in Wyoming that ended when Harris came down with a high fever, it&#x2019;s Grouper at its most economical, fitting seven gorgeously articulated, sepia-toned vignettes into the space of 22 minutes. \r\n\r\nTracklist: \r\n01 - The Races.flac \r\n02 - Parking Lot.flac \r\n03 - Driving.flac \r\n04 - Thanksgiving Song.flac \r\n05 - Birthday Song.flac \r\n06 - Blouse.flac \r\n07 - Breathing.flac \r\n\r\nSummary: \r\nCountry: USA \r\nGenre: ambient, dream-pop","last_updated":"2018-04-30T12:01:23.029Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:df17c7a0235f9020863c2fbefea8a63758da512d","dn":"[ambient, dream-pop] (2018) Grouper - Grid of Points [FLAC,Track","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"df17c7a0235f9020863c2fbefea8a63758da512d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,23,199,160,35,95,144,32,134,60,47,190,254,168,166,55,88,218,81,45]},"name":"[ambient, dream-pop] (2018) Grouper - Grid of Points [FLAC,Track","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
