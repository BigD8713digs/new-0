Blitzer \r\nPearson | January 2018 | ISBN-10: 0134683714 | PDF | 1056 pages | 113 mb\r\n\r\nFor courses in Liberal Arts Mathematics.\r\nShow students their world is profoundly mathematical, meaningful, and fun\r\nStudents often struggle to find the relevance of math in their everyday lives. In Thinking Mathematically, 7th Edition, Bob Blitzer&apos;s distinctive and relatable voice engages students in the world of math through compelling, real-world applications - student-loan debt, time breakdown for an average NFL broadcast, and many more.\r\nUnderstanding that most students in this course are not math majors (and are unlikely to take another math class), Blitzer uses current data compiled from hundreds of books, magazines, and online sources to show students how truly meaningful and fun math can be.\r\n\r\nAbout the Author\r\nBob Blitzer is a native of Manhattan and received a Bachelor of Arts degree with dual majors in mathematics and psychology (minor: English literature) from the City College of New York. His unusual combination of academic interests led him toward a Master of Arts in mathematics from the University of Miami and a doctorate in behavioral sciences from Nova University. \r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\nAbout the Author vi\r\nPreface vii\r\nResources for Success ix\r\nTo the Student xi\r\nAcknowledgments xii\r\nIndex of Applications xv\r\n1 Problem Solving and Critical Thinking 1\r\n2 Set Theory 49\r\n3 Logic 117\r\n4 Number Representation and Calculation 215\r\n5 Number Theory and the Real Number System 251\r\n6 Algebra: Equations and Inequalities 343\r\n7 Algebra: Graphs, Functions, and Linear Systems 411\r\n8 Personal Finance 493\r\n9 Measurement 581\r\n10 Geometry 615\r\n11 Counting Methods and Probability Theory 693\r\n12 Statistics 771\r\n13 Voting and Apportionment 845\r\n14 Graph Theory 897\r\nAnswers to Selected Exercises AA1\r\nSubject Index I1\r\nCredits C1\r\n <a href=\"\nhttps://i.postimg.cc/Kzh7mgss/Thinking-Mathematically-7th-Ed.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://i.postimg.cc/Kzh7mgss/Thinking-Mathematically-7th-Ed.jpg</a>","last_updated":"2018-10-29T12:14:36.453Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:346faf4def67cb1fc2ecf034755cfe2ce6ed4aaf","dn":"Thinking Mathematically (7th Ed)(gnv64)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"346faf4def67cb1fc2ecf034755cfe2ce6ed4aaf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,111,175,77,239,103,203,31,194,236,240,52,117,92,254,44,230,237,74,175]},"name":"Thinking Mathematically (7th Ed)(gnv64)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
