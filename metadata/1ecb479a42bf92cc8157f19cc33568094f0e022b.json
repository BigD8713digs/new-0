Most crucial for players in Japan, Bahrain, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Qatar and Saudi Arabia&#x2014;an issue affecting file deployment has been resolved. \r\n\r\nHere&apos;s the patch notes in full: \r\n\r\nResolved an issue affecting the deployment of full game files in Japan, Bahrain, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia.\r\nRe-enabled Async compute for AMD users (requires AMD driver version 17.10.3).\r\nTemporarily disabled Async compute on 1080ti until driver fix is in.\r\nRe-enabled Steam Overlay.\r\nAdded driver version detection and dialogue. \r\nMachineGames advises those interested in the above to install the patch via the Steam public beta branch, and by right clicking the game via your Steam library.
