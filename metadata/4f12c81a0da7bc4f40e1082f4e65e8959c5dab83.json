Yet, technology insider Alice Marwick contends in this insightful book, &#x201C;Web 2.0&#x201D; only encouraged a preoccupation with status and attention. Her original research - which includes conversations with entrepreneurs, Internet celebrities, and Silicon Valley journalists - explores the culture and ideology of San Francisco&#x2019;s tech community in the period between the dot com boom and the App store, when the city was the world&#x2019;s center of social media development. Marwick argues that early revolutionary goals have failed to materialize: while many continue to view social media as democratic, these technologies instead turn users into marketers and self-promoters, and leave technology companies poised to violate privacy and to prioritize profits over participation. Marwick analyzes status-building techniques - such as self-branding, micro-celebrity, and life-streaming - to show that Web 2.0 did not provide a cultural revolution, but only furthered inequality and reinforced traditional social stratification, demarcated by race, class, and gender.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-07-29T12:00:22.898Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f12c81a0da7bc4f40e1082f4e65e8959c5dab83","dn":"Status Update_ Celebrity, Publicity, and Branding in the Social ","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"4f12c81a0da7bc4f40e1082f4e65e8959c5dab83","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,18,200,26,13,167,188,79,64,225,8,47,78,101,232,149,156,93,171,131]},"name":"Status Update_ Celebrity, Publicity, and Branding in the Social ","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
