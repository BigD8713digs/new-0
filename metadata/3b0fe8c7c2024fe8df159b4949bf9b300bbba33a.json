Thirty years after its initial public airing, Le Samourai (1967) finally saw a limited American release in its intended form. Alain Delon stars as Jef Costello, a professional Parisian assassin-for-hire who, by nature of his work&apos;s solitary demands, has no friends. Although he is loved by Jane Lagrange (Natalie Delon, the star&apos;s real-life wife), Costello knows that Jane already has a lover. After he successfully wipes out a nightclub owner at the behest of his boss, Costello discovers that he was seen by the club&apos;s pianist, Valerie (Cathy Rosier). Although he survives a police lineup thanks to a lie offered up by the fearless Valerie, Costello&apos;s alibi disintegrates rapidly and his shadowy employer takes out a contract on him. As he seeks revenge on his betrayer, Costello must also stay one step ahead of a wily, determined superintendent (Francois Perier). Melville&apos;s film influenced several other filmmakers and projects, most notably director John Woo&apos;s The Killer (1989).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTARS.........: Alain Delon, Nathalie Delon, Fran&#xE7;ois P&#xE9;rier\r\nDIRECTOR......: Jean-Pierre Melville\r\nWRITERS.......: Jean-Pierre Melville, Georges Pellegrin\r\nGENRE.........: Crime, Drama, Mystery\r\nTOMATOMETER...: 100\r\nIMDB RATING...: 8.1/10  35,142 votes\r\nIMDB LINK.....: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062229\r\nRUNTIME.......: 1h 45mn\r\nSIZE..........: 4.22 GB\r\nVIDEO CODEC...: HEVC (<a href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection\" class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"f9b4989097b9b5cd\">[email&#xA0;protected]</a>)\r\nBITRATE.......: 5500 Kbps (2-pass)\r\nRESOLUTION....: 1920x1080\r\nASPECT RATIO..: 1.85:1\r\nFRAMERATE.....: 23.976 fps\r\nAUDIO.........: French AAC 1.0 256kbps\r\nSUBTITLES.....: ENG, FRE\r\nCHAPTERS......: Yes\r\nSOURCE........: Blu Ray\r\nENCODED BY....: Sartre\r\nENCODE DATE...: 2017-11-22","last_updated":"2017-11-23T12:07:27.691Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b0fe8c7c2024fe8df159b4949bf9b300bbba33a","dn":"Le.Samourai.1967.Criterion.1080p.BluRay.HEVC.AAC-SARTRE","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"3b0fe8c7c2024fe8df159b4949bf9b300bbba33a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,15,232,199,194,2,79,232,223,21,155,73,73,191,155,48,11,187,163,58]},"name":"Le.Samourai.1967.Criterion.1080p.BluRay.HEVC.AAC-SARTRE","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
