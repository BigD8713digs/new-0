Yet after his family moved to California, he learned everything he could about music, formed a band, and had a number-one hit with &quot;To Know Him Is to Love Him&quot;. He quickly became the top producer of early rock and roll and the originator of such girl groups as the Ronettes. He was a millionaire by age 21 and owned his own record label by 22. Hit followed hit, and for all of them he used a new recording style and technique called the &quot;wall of sound&quot;.\r\n\r\nBut the reign of the boy-man who owned pop music seemed doomed by the &quot;British Invasion&quot;, and Spector spiraled into paranoid isolation and peculiar behavior. Though he seemed to improve for a time, and even returned to the recording studio to work, his renascence didn&apos;t last, and in 2003, the actress Lana Clarkson was found at his home, dead from a gunshot wound.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-06-16T12:11:40.858Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:b45d226741409448278c5e004f517441131dd0a8","dn":"Tearing Down the Wall of Sound by Mick Brown EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"b45d226741409448278c5e004f517441131dd0a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,93,34,103,65,64,148,72,39,140,94,0,79,81,116,65,19,29,208,168]},"name":"Tearing Down the Wall of Sound by Mick Brown EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
