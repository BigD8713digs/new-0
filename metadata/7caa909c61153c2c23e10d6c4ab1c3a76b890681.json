Both the 12-year-old and his father become fugitives, forced to run from Coos County to Boston, to southern Vermont, to Toronto, pursued by the implacable constable. Their lone protector is a fiercely libertarian logger, once a river driver, who befriends them.\r\n\r\nIn a story spanning five decades, Last Night in Twisted River - John Irving&apos;s 12th novel - depicts the recent half-century in the United States as &quot;a living replica of Coos County, where lethal hatreds were generally permitted to run their course&quot;.\r\n\r\nFrom the novel&apos;s taut opening sentence - &quot;The young Canadian, who could not have been more than 15, had hesitated too long&quot; - to its elegiac final chapter, Last Night in Twisted River is written with the historical authenticity and emotional authority of The Cider House Rules and A Prayer for Owen Meany. It is also as violent and disturbing a story as John Irving&apos;s breakthrough best seller The World According to Garp.\r\n\r\nWhat further distinguishes Last Night in Twisted River is the author&apos;s unmistakable voice - the inimitable voice of an accomplished storyteller. Near the end of this moving novel, John Irving writes: &quot;We don&apos;t always have a choice how we get to know one another. Sometimes, people fall into our lives cleanly - as if out of the sky, or as if there were a direct flight from Heaven to Earth - the same sudden way we lose people, who once seemed they would always be part of our lives.&quot;","last_updated":"2017-06-29T12:00:29.158Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:7caa909c61153c2c23e10d6c4ab1c3a76b890681","dn":"Last Night in Twisted River by John Irving epub RtR","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"7caa909c61153c2c23e10d6c4ab1c3a76b890681","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,170,144,156,97,21,60,44,35,225,13,108,74,177,195,167,107,137,6,129]},"name":"Last Night in Twisted River by John Irving epub RtR","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
