In this revolutionary book, best-selling author John Robbins presents us with a bold new paradigm of aging, showing us how we can increase not only our lifespan but also our health span.\r\n\r\nThrough the example of four very different cultures that have the distinction of producing some of the world&apos;s healthiest, oldest people, Robbins reveals the secrets for living an extended and fulfilling life in which our later years become a period of wisdom, vitality, and happiness. Bringing the traditions of these cultures together with the latest breakthroughs in medical science, Robbins reveals that, remarkably, they both point in the same direction.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-06-16T12:10:12.814Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:86a12f0522f74e16ab479511e7a23454c4c5ca1c","dn":"Healthy at 100 by John Robbins EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"86a12f0522f74e16ab479511e7a23454c4c5ca1c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,161,47,5,34,247,78,22,171,71,149,17,231,162,52,84,196,197,202,28]},"name":"Healthy at 100 by John Robbins EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
