The film concentrates on alcoholic writer Mickey Rourke (the Bukowski alter ego) who carries on a hate-hate relationship with bartender Frank Stallone. Rourke makes the acquaintance of another of society&apos;s castaways, Faye Dunaway, who in addition to being a souse is said to be crazy. They move in together, even though Dunaway all but promises to be unfaithful for the price of a drink. Rourke has a chance to clean up his act when offered a large commission for his writings by publisher Alice Krige. They too end up in bed, each trying to change the other. The clarion call of the cheap wine bottle overrides Rourke&apos;s half-hearted efforts to enter the mainstream. Watch for author Charles Bukowski, as well as Fritz &quot;Pop!&quot; Feld and Vance Colvig (who&apos;s made a career out of playing street people) in Barfly bit parts. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTARS.........: Mickey Rourke, Faye Dunaway, Alice Krige \r\nDIRECTOR......: Barbet Schroeder \r\nWRITERS.......: Charles Bukowski \r\nGENRE.........: Comedy, Drama, Romance \r\nTOMATOMETER...: 74 \r\nIMDB RATING...: 7.3/10 16,082 votes \r\nIMDB LINK.....: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092618 \r\nRUNTIME.......: 1h 40mn \r\nSIZE..........: 3.66 GB \r\nVIDEO CODEC...: HEVC (<a href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection\" class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"f2bf939b9cb2bec6\">[email&#xA0;protected]</a>) \r\nBITRATE.......: 5000 Kbps (2-pass) \r\nRESOLUTION....: 1920x1080 \r\nASPECT RATIO..: 1.85:1 \r\nFRAMERATE.....: 23.976 fps \r\nAUDIO.........: English AAC 2.0 238kbps \r\nSUBTITLES.....: ENG, GER \r\nCHAPTERS......: Yes \r\nSOURCE........: German Blu Ray \r\nENCODED BY....: Sartre \r\nENCODE DATE...: 2018-03-25","last_updated":"2018-04-29T12:03:29.968Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:48fcba493d99d111fe2c89dcff2da3a5189f1335","dn":"Barfly.1987.1080p.BluRay.HEVC.AAC-SARTRE","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"48fcba493d99d111fe2c89dcff2da3a5189f1335","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,252,186,73,61,153,209,17,254,44,137,220,255,45,163,165,24,159,19,53]},"name":"Barfly.1987.1080p.BluRay.HEVC.AAC-SARTRE","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
