The author explores a general framework for the nucleation and growth of condensed phases from liquid solutions. Practical situations are extensively described, providing state-of-the art information on Cu electroplating and related processes for the fabrication of advanced interconnects and elaboration of metallic nanoparticles.\r\n\r\nDerives the basic equations of nucleation from fundamental thermodynamic and kinetic relations\r\nExplores the main outcomes of a range of nucleation theories\r\nFeatures practical examples to further develop the theoretical aspects\r\nProvides state-of-the art information on Cu electroplating and related processes for the fabrication of advanced interconnects and elaboration of metallic nanoparticles","last_updated":"2017-06-08T12:00:35.104Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:8693c9827ee06cf161325bac7b6dc6108ffdafa3","dn":"Nucleation and Growth of Metals - From Thin Films to Nanoparticl","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"8693c9827ee06cf161325bac7b6dc6108ffdafa3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,147,201,130,126,224,108,241,97,50,91,172,123,109,198,16,143,253,175,163]},"name":"Nucleation and Growth of Metals - From Thin Films to Nanoparticl","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
