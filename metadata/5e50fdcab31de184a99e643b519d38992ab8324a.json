The Greeks are painfully aware that tourism is their best-functioning remaining industry. They value the visitor as never before, treat them with a warmth and courtesy that exceeds what you&apos;ll find in other parts of Europe. And more people are therefore coming here in unprecedented numbers.\r\n\r\nTo bring the current message of Greek tourism to a reading public, we&apos;ve called upon the research and writing talents of one of America&apos;s foremost travel journalists. Stephen Brewer has been writing travel guides for almost three decades. As an editor and writer, he has focused not just on the Frommer guides but on European coverage for such magazines as Esquire, Connoisseur and Geo.\r\nHolly","last_updated":"2017-07-24T12:01:56.157Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e50fdcab31de184a99e643b519d38992ab8324a","dn":"Frommer's Athens and the Greek Islands(2016) - EPUB - zeke23","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"5e50fdcab31de184a99e643b519d38992ab8324a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,80,253,202,179,29,225,132,169,158,100,59,81,157,56,153,42,184,50,74]},"name":"Frommer's Athens and the Greek Islands(2016) - EPUB - zeke23","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
