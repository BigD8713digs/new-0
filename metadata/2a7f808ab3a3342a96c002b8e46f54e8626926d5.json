Eric&#x2019;s 40 year career has afforded him the opportunity to travel the world performing with some of the world&apos;s greatest jazz artists. Eric Johnson&apos;s career began in Pittsburgh, in the late 60&apos;s Rhythm and Blues/Jazz Funk circuit.  After graduating high school, a bold, eager Eric Johnson took his guitar and went on the road with legendary organist Brother Jack McDuff. Johnson soon became a popular sideman working with Leon Spencer Jr., Lou Donaldson, Jimmy McGriff, Stanley Turrentine, Hank Crawford, Ramsey Lewis and many others.\r\nSince 2000, he has been performing with old friends Dr.Lonnie Smith and Lou Donaldson on occasion. Eric has been recording and touring Japan with organist Akiko Tsuruga. \r\n\r\n--------\r\n\r\nL Hammond, The Pirate Bay, where you&apos;ll find more jazz organ","last_updated":"2017-11-04T12:16:05.542Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a7f808ab3a3342a96c002b8e46f54e8626926d5","dn":"Eric Johnson - Makin Whoopie - Jazz Guitar - Jazz Organ","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"2a7f808ab3a3342a96c002b8e46f54e8626926d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,127,128,138,179,163,52,42,150,192,2,184,228,111,84,232,98,105,38,213]},"name":"Eric Johnson - Makin Whoopie - Jazz Guitar - Jazz Organ","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
