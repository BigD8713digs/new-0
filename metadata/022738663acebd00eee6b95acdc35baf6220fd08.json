Scott Turner EPUB\r\n\r\nA professor, biologist, and physiologist argues that modern Darwinism&apos;s materialist and mechanistic biases have led to a scientific dead end, unable to define what life is - and only an openness to the qualities of &quot;purpose and desire&quot; will move the field forward.\r\n\r\nJ. Scott Turner contends, &quot;To be scientists, we force ourselves into a Hobson&apos;s choice on the matter: accept intentionality and purposefulness as real attributes of life, which disqualifies you as a scientist; or become a scientist and dismiss life&apos;s distinctive quality from your thinking. I have come to believe that this choice actually stands in the way of our having a fully coherent theory of life.&quot;\r\n\r\nGrowing research shows that life&apos;s most distinctive quality, shared by all living things, is purpose and desire: maintain homeostasis to sustain life. In Purpose and Desire, Turner draws on the work of Claude Bernard, a contemporary of Darwin revered among physiologists as the founder of experimental medicine, to build on Bernard&apos;s &quot;dangerous idea&quot; of vitalism, which seeks to identify what makes &quot;life&quot; a unique phenomenon of nature. To further its quest to achieve a fuller understanding of life, Turner argues, science must move beyond strictly accepted measures that consider only the mechanics of nature.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-10-26T12:00:41.177Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:022738663acebd00eee6b95acdc35baf6220fd08","dn":"Purpose and Desire by J.
