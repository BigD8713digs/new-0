S. Garp, the bastard son of Jenny Fields, a feminist leader ahead of her times. Here are the life and death of a famous mother and her almost-famous son; theirs is a world of sexual extremes, even of sexual assassinations.\r\n\r\nThe World According to Garp is a novel rich with &quot;lunacy and sorrow&quot;, yet the dark, violent events of the story do not undermine a comedy both ribald and robust. With more than 10 million copies in print, in more than 30 languages and in more than 40 countries, this novel provides almost cheerful, even hilarious evidence of its famous last line: &quot;In the world according to Garp, we are all terminal cases.&quot;","last_updated":"2017-06-29T12:00:30.200Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e72dda9460f9794332837708b840b7037027136","dn":"The World According to Garp by John Irving epub RtR","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"6e72dda9460f9794332837708b840b7037027136","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,114,221,169,70,15,151,148,51,40,55,112,139,132,11,112,55,2,113,54]},"name":"The World According to Garp by John Irving epub RtR","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
