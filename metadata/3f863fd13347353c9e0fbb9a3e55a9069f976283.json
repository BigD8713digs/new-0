A fascinating explanation of how evolution works, from best-selling author of The God Delusion, Richard Dawkins. \r\n\r\nThe river of Dawkins&apos; title is a river of DNA, flowing through time from the beginning of life on Earth to the present and onwards.\r\n\r\nDawkins explains that DNA must be thought of as the most sophisticated information\r\nsystem imaginable: &apos;Life is just bytes and bytes of information,&apos; he writes. Using this perspective, he describes the mechanisms by which evolution has taken place, gradually but inexorably, over a period of three thousand million years. It is the story of how evolution happens rather than a narrative of what has actually happened in evolution.\r\n\r\nHe discusses current views on the process of human evolution, including the idea that we all trace back to a comparatively recent African &apos;Eve&apos;, and speculates that the &apos;information explosion&apos; that was unleashed on Earth when DNA came into being has almost certainly happened in other places in the universe.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-09-15T12:00:29.473Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f863fd13347353c9e0fbb9a3e55a9069f976283","dn":"River Out of Eden_ A Darwinian View of Life by Richard Dawkins e","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"3f863fd13347353c9e0fbb9a3e55a9069f976283","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,134,63,209,51,71,53,60,158,15,187,154,62,85,169,6,159,151,98,131]},"name":"River Out of Eden_ A Darwinian View of Life by Richard Dawkins e","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
