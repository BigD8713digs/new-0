Edgar Hoover&#x2019;s FBI considered the Harlem-born author the most powerful broker between black art and black power. Baldwin&#x2019;s 1,884-page FBI file, covering the period from 1958 to 1974, was the largest compiled on any African American artist of the Civil Rights era. This collection of once-secret documents, never before published in book form, captures the FBI&#x2019;s anxious tracking of Baldwin&#x2019;s writings, phone conversations, and sexual habits&#x2014;and Baldwin&#x2019;s defiant efforts to spy back at Hoover and his G-men.\r\n\r\nJames Baldwin: The FBI File reproduces over one hundred original FBI records, selected by the noted literary historian whose award-winning book, F.B. Eyes: How J. Edgar Hoover&#x2019;s Ghostreaders Framed African American Literature, brought renewed attention to bureau surveillance. William J. Maxwell also provides an introduction exploring Baldwin&apos;s enduring relevance in the time of Black Lives Matter along with running commentaries that orient the reader and offer historical context, making this book a revealing look at a crucial slice of the American past&#x2014;and present","last_updated":"2017-07-09T12:01:01.493Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d5f7f32139579f29ed5b03b90c177bc18b189d7","dn":"James Baldwin - The FBI File (2017) (Epub) Gooner","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"9d5f7f32139579f29ed5b03b90c177bc18b189d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,95,127,50,19,149,121,242,158,213,176,59,144,193,119,188,24,177,137,215]},"name":"James Baldwin - The FBI File (2017) (Epub) Gooner","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
