Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy March are raised in genteel poverty by their loving mother, Marmee, while their father serves as a chaplain during the American Civil War. Jo, at 15, is ungainly, unconventional, and enterprising, with an ambition to be an author. Meg, a year older, is pretty and wishes to be a lady. Beth is a delicate child of 13 with a taste for music. Amy is a blonde beauty of 12. The story explores their domestic adventures, their attempts to increase the family&apos;s small income, their friendship with the neighboring Laurence family, and their later love affairs and destinies as women.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-10-17T12:07:07.471Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a49fa756b96e9019bac5d1c5969662552e815d0","dn":"Little Women by Louisa May Alcot","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"3a49fa756b96e9019bac5d1c5969662552e815d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,73,250,117,107,150,233,1,155,172,93,28,89,105,102,37,82,232,21,208]},"name":"Little Women by Louisa May Alcot","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
