The authors provide even, well-integrated coverage of physics, chemistry, earth science, astronomy, and biology. The text&#x2019;s pedagogy (chapter outlines, core concept maps, and overviews) reveals how the science disciplines are interrelated and integrated throughout the text.\r\n\r\nThis edition continues to introduce basic concepts and key ideas while providing opportunities for students to learn reasoning skills and a new way of thinking about their environment. Additional content has been added to this edition, including a discussion of &#x201C;Scientific Communication&#x201D; to chapter 1, &#x201C;Simple Machines&#x201D; to chapter 3, and &#x201C;efficiency&#x201D; to chapter 4.\r\n\r\nThe book is intended to serve the needs of non-science majors who are required to complete one or more science courses as part of a general or basic studies requirement. No prior work in science is assumed. The language, as well as the mathematics, is as simple as can be practical for a college-level science course","last_updated":"2017-08-07T12:00:25.228Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:e241c8969a4628308ba2a619c41bb412090a61df","dn":"Integrated Science 6th ed","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"e241c8969a4628308ba2a619c41bb412090a61df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,65,200,150,154,70,40,48,139,162,166,25,196,27,180,18,9,10,97,223]},"name":"Integrated Science 6th ed","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
