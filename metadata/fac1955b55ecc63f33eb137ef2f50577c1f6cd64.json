Reeling with heartache, and in search of a respite, she flees to the small coastal town of Rodanthe, North Carolina, to tend to a friend&apos;s inn for the weekend.\r\n\r\nBut when a major storm starts moving in, it appears that Adrienne&apos;s perfect getaway will be ruined - until a guest named Paul Flanner arrives.
