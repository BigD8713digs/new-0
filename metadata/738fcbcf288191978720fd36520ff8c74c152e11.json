But that&apos;s just the beginning. For years, restaurants have used sous vide to perfectly cook a wide variety of foods-now you can do the same. Join sous vide recipe developer Christina Wylie and take your skills to the next level: Use sous vide to make the perfect soft boiled eggs, then go further and learn how to use it to make scrambled eggs, overnight oatmeal, and other breakfast staples. For lunch, try topping your salad with perfectly cooked sous vide tuna or salmon (the secret is a short brine). For dinner, the options are endless. Choose from Asian dishes like Char Siu Pork Loin and Miso-Marinated Cod, reinvent a favorite with the Deconstructed Beef Wellington or Spicy Southern-Fried Chicken, or enjoy a surprisingly simple 48-Hour Beef Brisket. Finish the meal with a sous vide twist on cheesecake or a nightcap of homemade spiced rum (speed-infused using sous vide, of course).\r\n\r\nWith recommended times and temperatures for every recipe, unique combinations of sous vide with other cooking techniques, and more than 100 recipes to explore, this book will help you get the most out of sous vide","last_updated":"2017-06-12T12:01:29.791Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:738fcbcf288191978720fd36520ff8c74c152e11","dn":"The Sous Vide Kitchen: Techniques, Ideas, and More Than 100 Reci","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"738fcbcf288191978720fd36520ff8c74c152e11","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,143,203,207,40,129,145,151,135,32,253,54,82,15,248,199,76,21,46,17]},"name":"The Sous Vide Kitchen: Techniques, Ideas, and More Than 100 Reci","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
