Not that these \r\ndon&apos;t belong on the album, but they just shouldn&apos;t be so close together. \r\nAlso, Hot Line is a great rocking song that would have been better \r\nsuited to being placed near the start of the album than buried near the \r\nend with Keep It Warm. And the title song is so intense with its moody, \r\nthick production and its slow fade out on the amazing solo that really \r\nnothing should follow it. That is the end of the album to me. I always \r\nturned it off after that because nothing should follow that song.\r\n\r\nThe source for this was the 2011 2CD set which I tweaked a bit for volume \r\nand tonality and, for The Fallen, the bootleg CD The Manor Tapes, which \r\nreceived full remastering","last_updated":"2018-06-03T12:06:44.622Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:69a5fdd722696fa75731a83b9ef3c7ad11ca7fb2","dn":"Black Sabbath Born Again As It Should Have Been Heywood Ed.
