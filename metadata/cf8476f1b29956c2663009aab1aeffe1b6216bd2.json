Dower MOBI\r\n\r\nWar Without Mercy has been hailed by the New York Times as &quot;one of the most original and important books to be written about the war between Japan and the United States.&quot; In this monumental history, professor John Dower reveals a hidden, explosive dimension of the Pacific War - race - while writing what John Toland has called &quot;a landmark book...a powerful, moving, and evenhanded history that is sorely needed in both America and Japan.&quot;\r\n\r\nDrawing on American and Japanese songs, slogans, cartoons, propaganda films, secret reports, and a wealth of other documents of the time, Dower opens up a whole new way of looking at that bitter struggle of four and a half decades ago and its ramifications in our lives today. As Edwin O. Reischauer, former ambassador to Japan, has pointed out, this book offers &quot;a lesson that the postwar generations need most...with eloquence, crushing detail, and power.&quot;\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-05-08T12:00:50.441Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf8476f1b29956c2663009aab1aeffe1b6216bd2","dn":"War Without Mercy by John W.
