Play your part in the Second Contact War in a campaign with a branching story and over 60 missions, or create your own scenarios in skirmish mode battles.\r\n\r\nGive your orders, and watch the results in explosive pausable real-time. Tailor your arsenal of crew abilities and assault class ships as your fleet grows with your command. Exploit the enemy&#x2019;s weaknesses with superior positioning and flanking manoeuvres to inflict devastating damage.\r\n\r\nSix classes of assaults ships are yours to command. Make precision strikes with the swift Swordfish Raiders, or lead from the bridge of a hulking Kraken Dreadnought. Change your tactics as you order reinforcements with stun guns, guided missiles, unmanned fighter drones and single-focus DEW beams.\r\n\r\nFor more info go to: https://www.gog.com/game/star_hammer_the_vanguard_prophecy","last_updated":"2017-12-09T12:04:13.914Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:716bd40f6c3f71b66c5f81b3544ca60ee459104b","dn":"Star.Hammer.The.Vanguard.Prophecy-GOG","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"716bd40f6c3f71b66c5f81b3544ca60ee459104b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,107,212,15,108,63,113,182,108,95,129,179,84,76,166,14,228,89,16,75]},"name":"Star.Hammer.The.Vanguard.Prophecy-GOG","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
