In the first of a series of irresistible standalone romances from New York Times best-selling author Sawyer Bennett, a city girl rediscovers love and lust in the Alaskan wilderness.\r\n\r\nValentine French may be the sassiest dating columnist in New York City, but the abundance of metrosexuals in her adopted metropolis is seriously cramping her style. Where are the beefy all-American boys? Hoping to find some inspiration, Val heads to Alaska, where the men outnumber the women 15 to one and wrestle grizzly bears for sport. Or so she can only imagine. Suddenly the most eligible bachelorette in a town full of horny lumberjacks, Val is writing her best columns ever. But if she doesn&apos;t get her nose out of her laptop, she just might miss out on Mr. Right.\r\n\r\nLogan Burke is the sheriff of the little podunk town that Val finds so charmingly backward. He&apos;s not that different from the guys she&apos;s using for her little experiment; it&apos;s just that one date would never be enough for Logan. As he listens to Val complain about love over beers in the local tavern, he realizes that she can&apos;t see the forest for the trees. Because if she would ever give up her Prada bags and $14 martinis, Logan would give her the only luxury that matters: his heart.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-08-10T12:00:38.373Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d1272bf5511d6e3fe4712cf675e35f3a2fc0f78","dn":"Sex in the Sticks_ A Love Hurts Novel by Sawyer Bennett ePUB eBO","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"7d1272bf5511d6e3fe4712cf675e35f3a2fc0f78","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,18,114,191,85,17,214,227,254,71,18,207,103,94,53,243,162,252,15,120]},"name":"Sex in the Sticks_ A Love Hurts Novel by Sawyer Bennett ePUB eBO","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
