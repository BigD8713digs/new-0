She would bring her microbe-dense delicacies, her expertise, and her generosity to food communities across the country. Her motto: Tasty food belongs to everyone.\r\nIn a 1986 International Harvester bus-turned-fermentation-lab, Tara took off from Eugene, Oregon, teaching her skills to curious attendees, hosting potlucks, and sampling the seasonal produce of each stop on her tour. The project accrued a following, and she gave it a name: Fermentation on Wheels.\r\nThrough her winning stories, illustrations, photographs, and fifty recipes, Fermentation on Wheels tracks the two-year. twenty-thousand mile journey that made Tara into a known apostle of outrageously delicious, creative, healthy, and sustainable fermented flavors?Cfrom sourdough to sauerkraut to wild berry wines. A practical and delectable cookbook, Fermentation on Wheels is also an inspiring celebration of how food traditions (and starter cultures) can bring people together, pollinate their minds, and change their lives for the better.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\nNavigating Fermentation\r\nPrelude: Dreams &amp; the Universe\r\nLife Is a Potluck\r\nCulturing the Southwest\r\nHome, Sour Home\r\nThe Deepest South\r\nEveryone Prays in Appalachia\r\nThe Crowded Northeast\r\nNew England Revelations\r\nFall Restoration\r\nRe-wilding New York City\r\nDiscovering the Midwest\r\nScenes from a Middle-American Farm\r\nDriftless\r\nStaring at the Sun\r\nAcknowledgments\r\nIndex\r\nIndex of Recipe\r\n <a href=\"\nhttps://s26.postimg.org/68ly0e0ex/Fermentation_on_Wheels.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://s26.postimg.org/68ly0e0ex/Fermentation_on_Wheels.jpg</a>","last_updated":"2017-09-26T12:11:00.309Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:c8071d0092d0e02fb8763a5b74d9c419d7c794cf","dn":"Fermentation on Wheels (gnv64)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"c8071d0092d0e02fb8763a5b74d9c419d7c794cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,7,29,0,146,208,224,47,184,118,58,91,116,217,196,25,215,199,148,207]},"name":"Fermentation on Wheels (gnv64)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
