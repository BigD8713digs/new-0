But while these problems plague planet Earth, two-thirds of our globe is ocean. The seas can be home to pioneers, seasteaders, who are willing to homestead the Blue Frontier. Oil platforms and cruise ships already inhabit the waters; now it&apos;s time to take the next step to full-fledged ocean civilizations.\r\n\r\nIn their fascinating examination of a practical solution to our earthly problems, Joe Quirk and Patri Friedman profile some of the visionaries who are implementing basic concepts of seasteading: farming the oceans for new sources of nutrition; using the seas as a new sustainable energy source; establishing more equitable economies; and reinventing architecture to accommodate the demands of living on the ocean.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-07-15T12:00:57.728Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:4be2423daf98cdad70f7dd558c8feba95898cc3e","dn":"Seasteading by Joe Quirk, Patri Friedman EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"4be2423daf98cdad70f7dd558c8feba95898cc3e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,226,66,61,175,152,205,173,112,247,221,85,140,143,235,169,88,152,204,62]},"name":"Seasteading by Joe Quirk, Patri Friedman EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
