In her titular piece, &quot;The Wrong Way to Save Your Life&quot;, she answers the question of what has value in our lives - a question no longer rhetorical when the apartment above her family&apos;s goes up in flames. &quot;Here Is My Heart&quot; sheds light on Megan&apos;s close relationship with her father, whose continued insistence on climbing mountains despite a series of heart attacks leads the author to dissect deer hearts in a poetic attempt to interrogate her own feelings about mortality.\r\n\r\nWhether she&apos;s imagining the implications of open-carry laws on college campuses, recounting the story of going underwater on the mortgage of her first home, or revealing the unexpected pains and joys of marriage and motherhood, Stielstra&apos;s work informs, impels, enlightens, and embraces us all. The result is something beautiful - this story and her courage, and, potentially, our own.\r\n\r\nIntellectually fierce and viscerally intimate, Megan Stielstra&apos;s voice is witty, wise, warm, and above all achingly human.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-09-24T12:02:48.358Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:029239ab79b649f1f3a9a59b2c6eea7eadb62124","dn":"The Wrong Way to Save Your Life_ Essays by Megan Stielstra 2017 ","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"029239ab79b649f1f3a9a59b2c6eea7eadb62124","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,146,57,171,121,182,73,241,243,169,165,155,44,110,234,126,173,182,33,36]},"name":"The Wrong Way to Save Your Life_ Essays by Megan Stielstra 2017 ","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
