Each of these four epic tracks is a testament to the fact that Causa Sui has carved out a singular niche for themselves, where vintage Sabbath-isms are filtered through a distinctively post-modern ethos. \r\nAnd that&#x2019;s what sets Causa Sui apart: the band&#x2019;s individual members has had their hands in a wide variety of music in the past 15 year &#x2013; ambient drone, impro sessions with krautrock legends, synthesizer music, and they&#x2019;ve made records with guys from Tortoise and Sunburned Hand of the Man. Causa Sui&#x2019;s brand of rock conveys everything that&#x2019;s so great about fuzzed-out heaviness, yet there&#x2019;s something about it that makes the listening experience far from trivial. In stark contrast to the standards of the stoner/doom scenes Causa Sui manages to be weighty and peaceful at the same &#x2013; forceful, yet vulnerable, ecstatic yet thoughtful. \r\nOn opener &#x201D;The Drop&#x201D; the band drives a thick John Bonham groove into Can-esque freeform ecstasy before liquefying the groove into a warm ocean of shoegazy guitars and wistful synths. On 11-minute centerpiece, &#x201D;El Fuego&#x201D;, they create a sonic river that seems be channelling Popol Vuh as much as Palm Desert stoner rock. And the closing title track can best be described as sounding like that Sonic Youth sludge-metal record that never was. \r\n\r\nTracklist: \r\n01 - The Drop.flac \r\n02 - El Fuego.flac \r\n03 - Viborera.flac \r\n04 - Seven Hills.flac \r\n05 - Vibraciones Doradas.flac \r\n\r\nSummary: \r\nCountry: Denmark \r\nGenre: post-rock, psychedelic rock","last_updated":"2018-05-04T12:04:05.031Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:668ca1573a4b5df43a490ff4a441c3df7bb5ad8c","dn":"[post-rock, psychedelic rock] (2017) Causa Sui - Vibraciones Dor","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"668ca1573a4b5df43a490ff4a441c3df7bb5ad8c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,140,161,87,58,75,93,244,58,73,15,244,164,65,195,223,123,181,173,140]},"name":"[post-rock, psychedelic rock] (2017) Causa Sui - Vibraciones Dor","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
