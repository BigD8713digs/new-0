Including an early show from the band recorded in the Netherlands in 1973 while the guys were on their first European jaunt, disc one further features their set at the California Jam Festival in 1974, which includes a guest appearance from Jackson Browne. Disc 2 continues with the Eagles show from The Forum in Inglewood, CA, at the beginning of the next decade in 1980, a rare broadcast which features the wonderful King Of Hollywood - a tune rarely played live - and an excellent version of Joe Walsh s Turn To Stone , among other favourites. Disc 3 concludes this compilation with an acoustic set from Burbank, CA in 1994, with the boys playing a selection of their very finest and best known songs, when even at this late period in the group s history it is clear that the Eagles had lost none of their live prowess or dynamic performance skills","last_updated":"2017-08-25T12:02:23.207Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:17603b92035eac2b9ecf909d2d3a8da1055dbc31","dn":"Eagles - 2017 Transmission Impossible (1973-94)(3CD)[FLAC]","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"17603b92035eac2b9ecf909d2d3a8da1055dbc31","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,96,59,146,3,94,172,43,158,207,144,157,45,58,141,161,5,93,188,49]},"name":"Eagles - 2017 Transmission Impossible (1973-94)(3CD)[FLAC]","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
