Software programs sometimes crash during a transaction with a file and this can accidentally delete the file. Viruses are another common cause of data loss. This is where File Recovery comes to rescue. With this program you can recover deleted documents, music, digital photos, applications and all other files from your hard drive, USB memory sticks or digital camera memory cards.\r\n\r\nSupport for Any Types of Drives And Devices\r\nAuslogics File Recovery guarantees professional recovery of all file types from all kinds of media. With the program you can recover files deleted from your PC, external hard drives and USB sticks in a quick and easy way. The program also supports all types of digital cameras&apos; and camcorders&apos; memory cards, so any recently deleted picture or movie from your digital camera can be restored as well.\r\n\r\nCreate an Image of Your Disk\r\nTake advantage of the program&apos;s useful feature that allows you to create a complete disk image. The disk image file is the exact image of the logical drive along with all the information contained on the disk, including deleted files. This option allows you to recover files from the disk image later on while continuing working with the logical drive. Having an image of your drive is also an excellent way to back up all your data.\r\n\r\nWipe Free Disk Space\r\nSimilar to File Shredder, Disk Wiper securely deletes files from your disk drive. The difference is that this wizard will wipe the free space on your drive, so that any traces of deleted files are gone for good. You don&apos;t have to select specific files to delete - the tool only affects files that have already been deleted. Use this feature to be sure that none of your previously deleted files can ever be restored.\r\n\r\nWhats New:\r\nMade some functionality improvements;\r\nFixed all known bugs.\r\n\r\nHOMEPAGE <a href=\"\nhttp://www.auslogics.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttp://www.auslogics.com</a>","last_updated":"2018-07-21T12:12:22.993Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:68fea4135140f5e4dd7df55b0c0b736940ee8dd6","dn":" Auslogics File Recovery 8.0.13.0 Final !{Latest}","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"68fea4135140f5e4dd7df55b0c0b736940ee8dd6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,254,164,19,81,64,245,228,221,125,245,91,12,11,115,105,64,238,141,214]},"name":" Auslogics File Recovery 8.0.13.0 Final !{Latest}","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
