Her gift of communicating with animals works just fine, but she doesn&apos;t know a Thurisaz rune from a Wunjo, and she can&apos;t even cast a circle of protection without a cheat sheet. That&apos;s why she decided to leave her tiny village on the Isle of Parthas, North Sea, for a normal non-magical life halfway around the world.\r\n\r\nBut when her beloved grandfather disappears along with a handful of villagers, she&apos;s forced to return home and use her gift -- and her crappy druid magic -- to help them. Unfortunately, she&apos;s not exactly prepared to face the very real monsters that are popping up all over, from mutant spiders to banshees, black dogs ... and worse.\r\n\r\nThat&apos;s when she learns all the crazy stories her father told her growing up, about the old deserted castle on the island having belonged to King Arthur, might not be so crazy after all","last_updated":"2017-09-20T12:15:06.005Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:93306155e3ac1b3ee332887a334ce24236ec4788","dn":"Sonya Bateman-The Cursing Stones (EPUB)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"93306155e3ac1b3ee332887a334ce24236ec4788","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,48,97,85,227,172,27,62,227,50,136,122,51,76,226,66,54,236,71,136]},"name":"Sonya Bateman-The Cursing Stones (EPUB)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
