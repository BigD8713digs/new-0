In the new Fourth Edition, they continue to use stories and current issues, such as discussion of cancer to teach cell division, to connect biology to student&#x2019;s lives. Learning Outcomes are new to this edition and integrated within the book to help professors guide students&#x2019; reading and to help students assess their understanding of biology.\r\n\r\nA new Chapter 3, &#x201C;Is It Possible to Supplement Your Way to Better Health? Nutrients and Membrane Transport,&#x201D; offers an engaging storyline and focused coverage on micro- and macro-nutrients, antioxidants, passive and active transport, and exocytosis and endocytosis.\r\nTable of Contents\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1 Can Science Cure the Common Cold?: Introduction to the Scientific Method\r\n\r\nUnit One: Chemistry and Cells\r\nCHAPTER 2 Are We Alone in the Universe?: Water, Biochemistry, and Cells\r\nCHAPTER 3 Is It Possible to Supplement Your Way to Better Health?: Nutrients and Membrane Transport\r\nCHAPTER 4 Fat: How Much Is Right for You?: Enzymes, Metabolism, and Cellular Respiration\r\nCHAPTER 5 Life in the Greenhouse: Photosynthesis and Global Warming\r\n\r\nUnit Two: Genetics\r\nCHAPTER 6 Cancer: DNA Synthesis, Mitosis, and Meiosis\r\nCHAPTER 7 Are You Only as Smart as Your Genes?: Mendelian and Quantitative Genetics\r\nCHAPTER 8 DNA Detective: Complex Patterns of Inheritance and DNA Fingerprinting\r\nCHAPTER 9 Genetically Modified Organisms: Gene Expression, Mutation, and Cloning\r\n\r\nUnit Three: Evolution\r\nCHAPTER 10 Where Did We Come From?: The Evidence for Evolution\r\nCHAPTER 11 An Evolving Enemy: Natural Selection\r\nCHAPTER 12 Who Am I?: Species and Races\r\nCHAPTER 13 Prospecting for Biological Gold: Biodiversity and Classification\r\n\r\nUnit Four: Ecology\r\nCHAPTER 14 Is the Human Population Too Large?: Population Ecology\r\nCHAPTER 15 Conserving Biodiversity: Community and Ecosystem Ecology\r\nCHAPTER 16 Where Do You Live?: Climate and Biomes\r\n\r\nUnit Five: Animal Structure and Function\r\nCHAPTER 17 Organ Donation: Tissues, Organs, and Organ Systems\r\nCHAPTER 18 Clearing the Air: Respiratory, Cardiovascular, and Urinary Systems\r\nCHAPTER 19 Vaccinations: Protection and Prevention or Peril?: Immune System, Bacteria, Viruses, and Other Pathogens\r\nCHAPTER 20 Sex Differences and Athleticism: Endocrine, Skeletal, and Muscular Systems\r\nCHAPTER 21 Is There Something in the Water?: Reproductive and Developmental Biology\r\nCHAPTER 22 Attention Deficit Disorder: Brain Structure and Function\r\n\r\nUnit Six: Plant Biology\r\nCHAPTER 23 Feeding the World: Plant Structure and Growth\r\nCHAPTER 24 Growing a Green Thumb: Plant Physiology\r\n\r\nAppendix: Meteric System Conversions and Periodic Table of Elements","last_updated":"2017-06-14T12:00:16.772Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:b16f821baac2deaa67939aad82163b5360cab0ad","dn":"Biology: Science for Life with Physiology, 4th Edition by Collee","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"b16f821baac2deaa67939aad82163b5360cab0ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,111,130,27,170,194,222,170,103,147,154,173,130,22,59,83,96,202,176,173]},"name":"Biology: Science for Life with Physiology, 4th Edition by Collee","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
