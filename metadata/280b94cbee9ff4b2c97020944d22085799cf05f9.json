It approaches the interface from both sides of the relation, and surveys a range of views on the mapping between them, with an emphasis on lexical approaches to argument structure. Stephen Wechsler begins by analysing the fundamental problem of word meaning, with discussions of vagueness and polysemy, complemented with a look at the roles of world knowledge and normative aspects of word meaning.\r\n\r\n---\r\n <a href=\"\nhttp://dlfeb.com/book/word-meaning-and-syntax-approaches-to-interface-oxford-surveys-in-syntax-morphology/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttp://dlfeb.com/book/word-meaning-and-syntax-approaches-to-interface-oxford-surveys-in-syntax-morphology/</a>","last_updated":"2017-07-22T12:04:14.501Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:280b94cbee9ff4b2c97020944d22085799cf05f9","dn":"WORD MEANING AND SYNTAX: APPROACHES TO THE INTERFACE ","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"280b94cbee9ff4b2c97020944d22085799cf05f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,11,148,203,238,159,244,178,201,112,32,148,77,34,8,87,153,207,5,249]},"name":"WORD MEANING AND SYNTAX: APPROACHES TO THE INTERFACE ","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
