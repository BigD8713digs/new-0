It was taped in 1974 and with much of the same crew. With Richard Pryor, Lily Tomlin, Don Bexley, Paul Mooney, Marlene Clark, and Martha Reeves. \r\n\r\nSince this was edited for GET TV, the missing segment apparently had Peter Sellers, who is listed in the opening credits. There may have also been an extra song by Martha. It was produced by Lorne Michaels, who also worked with Pryor on Lily Tomlin&apos;s specials pre-Saturday Night Live","last_updated":"2018-09-20T12:20:42.508Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:d246b0605ec65ef0af1e1737e2d284d5c2934789","dn":"FLIP WILSON...
