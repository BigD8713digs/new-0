But what of that world? How did 1860s Oxford react to Alice&apos;s disappearance?\r\n\r\nIn this brilliant work of fiction, Gregory Maguire turns his dazzling imagination to the question of underworlds, undergrounds, underpinnings - and understandings old and new, offering an inventive spin on Carroll&apos;s enduring tale. Ada, a friend of Alice&apos;s mentioned briefly in Alice&apos;s Adventures in Wonderland, is off to visit her friend but arrives a moment too late - and tumbles down the rabbit hole herself.\r\n\r\nAda brings to Wonderland her own imperfect apprehension of cause and effect as she embarks on an odyssey to find Alice and see her safely home from this surreal world below the world. If Eurydice can ever be returned to the arms of Orpheus or Lazarus can be raised from the tomb, perhaps Alice can be returned to life. Either way, everything that happens next is After Alice","last_updated":"2017-06-19T12:00:24.159Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:2fd040020581124fdc01fc3d0a347417a1f54c13","dn":"Gregory Maguire - After Alice 2015 Retail EPUB eBook-BitBook","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"2fd040020581124fdc01fc3d0a347417a1f54c13","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,208,64,2,5,129,18,79,220,1,252,61,10,52,116,23,161,245,76,19]},"name":"Gregory Maguire - After Alice 2015 Retail EPUB eBook-BitBook","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
