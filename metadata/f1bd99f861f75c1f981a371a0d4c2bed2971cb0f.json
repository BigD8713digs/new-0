Most game videos in NieR are in 1600x904 resolution, not \r\neven proper FullHD. And developers used extremely high bitrate for them, up to \r\n40 MBbit/second with 30 FPS. If you don&apos;t like the quality of re-encoded files, \r\nget original ones. Remember the choice is always yours, not mine.\r\n\r\nINSTALL NOTES: \r\n\r\n1. Download the torrent. \r\n2. Install the game Step by Step. \r\n3. Install Redist if needed. \r\n4. Block the game in your firewall \r\n5. Play through shortcut with admin rights. \r\n6.
