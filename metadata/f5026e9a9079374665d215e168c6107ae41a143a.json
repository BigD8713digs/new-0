Even worse, her sweet old lady neighbor, Lilly Martinelli, is arrested for the crime. The evidence against Lilly is flimsy at best, and Zola vows to clear her name - not only to make sure justice is served, but also to get rid of the trouble-making cat that Lilly has entrusted to her care while she&#x2019;s in jail.\r\n\r\nLuck is on her side. Lilly&#x2019;s hotter-than-heck pie-making nephew wants to help. Then again, maybe that&#x2019;s not such a good idea. Not just because Zola has a romantic past with him, but also because he soon bubbles up to the top of her suspect list.\r\n\r\nZola finds herself wading through a maze of clues and suspects: cheating husbands, purse-grabbing friends, shopping-obsessed daughters, not to mention a little creature running around town tormenting tourists with bad breath and sticky brown goo. With pressure from the coven elders and a sheriff itching to close the case, Zola must put her magical skills to the test in order to discover the true identity of the killer before Lilly&#x2019;s time runs out.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-07-18T12:00:38.835Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5026e9a9079374665d215e168c6107ae41a143a","dn":"Spell on Earth by Leighann Dobbs EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"f5026e9a9079374665d215e168c6107ae41a143a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,2,110,154,144,121,55,70,101,210,21,225,104,198,16,122,228,26,20,58]},"name":"Spell on Earth by Leighann Dobbs EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
