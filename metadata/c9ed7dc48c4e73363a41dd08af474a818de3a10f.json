Unable to read or write or recall the name of his hometown or even his own last name, he survived alone for weeks on the rough streets of Calcutta before ultimately being transferred to an agency and adopted by a couple in Australia.\r\n\r\nDespite his gratitude, Brierley always wondered about his origins.
