This compelling and wise memoir follows the timeline of early motherhood from pregnancy through toddlerhood. Momma Zen takes readers on a transformative journey, charting a mother&#x2019;s growth beyond naive expectations and disorientation to finding fulfillment in ordinary tasks, developing greater self-awareness and acceptance - to the gradual discovery of &quot;maternal bliss&quot;, a state of abiding happiness and ease that is available to us all.\r\n\r\nIn her gentle and reassuring voice, Karen Miller convinces us that ancient and authentic spiritual lessons can be as familiar as a lullaby, as ordinary as pureed peas, and as frequent as a sleepless night. She offers encouragement for the hard days, consolation for the long haul, and the lightheartedness every new mom needs to face the crooked path of motherhood straight on.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-01-27T12:05:38.110Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2fe1529691a22b5a74a9466c42eea0f730aded1","dn":"Momma Zen by Karen Maezen Miller EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"f2fe1529691a22b5a74a9466c42eea0f730aded1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,254,21,41,105,26,34,181,167,74,148,102,196,46,234,15,115,10,222,209]},"name":"Momma Zen by Karen Maezen Miller EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
