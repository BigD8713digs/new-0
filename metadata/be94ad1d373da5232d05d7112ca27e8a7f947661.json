The new album builds on the band&#x2019;s longstanding love of that most basic and profound musical form, bringing the same reverently irreverent and insistently playful approach to the blues that has marked the Micros music from the beginning. The blues provide another avenue for the band to explore jazz history while forging a sound quite unlike any other ensemble.\r\nSimultaneously embracing the past and the future makes perfect sense when you consider the fraught time and place that gave birth to the Microscopic Septet. In the early 1980s the New York jazz scene was divided, sometimes bitterly, between the emergence of the &#x2018;new traditionalists&#x2019; as typified by Wynton Marsalis and the experimentation and stylistic mash-ups of the emerging downtown players. Rejecting allegiance to any particular camp or faction, the Micros forged their own path with an ethos succinctly summed up by co-leader Phillip Johnston: &#x201C;Break all the rules and respect all the saints.&#x201D; - Cuneiform","last_updated":"2017-08-12T12:00:49.940Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:be94ad1d373da5232d05d7112ca27e8a7f947661","dn":"The Microscopic Septet 2017 Been Up So Long...","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"be94ad1d373da5232d05d7112ca27e8a7f947661","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,148,173,29,55,61,165,35,45,5,215,17,44,162,126,138,127,148,118,97]},"name":"The Microscopic Septet 2017 Been Up So Long...","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
