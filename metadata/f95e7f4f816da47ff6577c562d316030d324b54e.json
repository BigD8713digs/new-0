Both said their mom&#x2019;s drinking was out of control. Dr. Phil sent Treva to Origins Recovery Center where she spent 67 days and entered a sober living facility that ended up kicking her out for breaking the number 1 rule: no drinking. Since then, Treva has continued to drink and was arrested for two DUIs and made headline news when a judge ordered her to wear an alcohol monitoring bracelet and a GPS tracker and placed her under house arrest, before sentencing her to 45 days in jail. Morgan and Ashley say they&#x2019;re scared their mom will die or kill someone else while driving drunk, so they reached out to Dr. Phil once again for help","last_updated":"2017-11-24T12:04:02.122Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:f95e7f4f816da47ff6577c562d316030d324b54e","dn":"Dr.Phil.Show.2017.09.08-CBS","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"f95e7f4f816da47ff6577c562d316030d324b54e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,94,127,79,129,109,164,127,246,87,124,86,45,49,96,48,211,36,181,78]},"name":"Dr.Phil.Show.2017.09.08-CBS","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
