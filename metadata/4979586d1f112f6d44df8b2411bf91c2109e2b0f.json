The Baugh Contagion swept across the planet. Its victims were left twitching, adrenalized cannibals that quickly became know as Junkies. Civilization crumbled as people created isolated safe havens to hide from the infected... and the possibly infected. Now, as society nears a tipping point, lives will intersect and intertwine across two days in a desolate city.\r\n\r\nThe Junkie Quatrain is four tales of survival, and four types of post-apocalypse story, because the end of the world means different things for different people. Loss. Opportunity. Hope. Or maybe just another day on the job.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-04-25T12:04:04.328Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:4979586d1f112f6d44df8b2411bf91c2109e2b0f","dn":"The Junkie Quatrain by Peter Clines MOBI","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"4979586d1f112f6d44df8b2411bf91c2109e2b0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,121,88,109,31,17,47,109,68,223,139,36,17,191,145,194,16,158,43,15]},"name":"The Junkie Quatrain by Peter Clines MOBI","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
