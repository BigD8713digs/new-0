With the exception of the hour-long pilot, the series features 30-minute road trips with the Lowe boys, and occasional TV guest stars known in the field, investigating common urban myths and legends that Rob has loved since he was a young boy and has shared with his boys throughout their growth, sometimes to the frustration of the boys&apos; mom and Lowe&apos;s wife, Sheryl. Some of the topics being explored are Bigfoot/Sasquatch, the alleged unidentified &quot;submerged&quot; objects that may have a base right off the coast from L.A., alien abduction, and ghosts and their direct responses to stimuli","last_updated":"2018-07-19T12:10:06.324Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a2d7c6b1cd7050b3cf5fa5a804246dd6107cf8a","dn":"The Lowe Files Paranormal Investigation Series","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"7a2d7c6b1cd7050b3cf5fa5a804246dd6107cf8a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,45,124,107,28,215,5,11,60,245,250,90,128,66,70,221,97,7,207,138]},"name":"The Lowe Files Paranormal Investigation Series","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
