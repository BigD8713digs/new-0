The result is like the most riveting of real-life detective stories - one that will completely change your view of Presley&apos;s life, success, and death.\r\n\r\nWhile scores of books have been written about Elvis Presley, this is the first meticulously researched biography of Tom Parker written by someone who knew him personally. And for anyone truly interested in the performer many consider the greatest and most influential of the 20th century, it is impossible to understand how Elvis came to be such a phenomenon without examining the life and mind of Parker, the man who virtually controlled Elvis&apos; every move.\r\n\r\nAlanna Nash has been covering the story of Elvis Presley and Colonel Tom Parker since the day of Presley&apos;s funeral in Memphis, Tennessee. She was the first journalist allowed to view Presley&apos;s body, a compelling and surprising sight. But the profile of Parker attending the funeral in a Hawaiian shirt and a baseball cap was even stranger and led her to investigate the man behind the myth.\r\n\r\n..\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-06-08T12:15:52.263Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:9882e2a81af5fde994d77abfca536b8e5a027bae","dn":"The Colonel by Alanna Nash EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"9882e2a81af5fde994d77abfca536b8e5a027bae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,130,226,168,26,245,253,233,148,215,122,191,202,83,107,142,90,2,123,174]},"name":"The Colonel by Alanna Nash EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
