Until something happens that wrecks them.\r\n\r\nI&apos;d trusted Henri more than I&apos;d trusted myself. Wherever she told me to go, I&apos;d follow.\r\n\r\nThen the unthinkable occurs - a watery nightmare off the dazzling coast. The girls wash up onshore, stranded. Their only companion is Alex, a troubled boy agonizing over his own secrets. Trapped in a gorgeous hell, Emma and Alex fall together as Emma and Henri fall catastrophically apart. To find their way home, the sisters must find their way back to each other. But there&apos;s no map for this. Can they survive the unearthing of the past and the upheaval of the present?\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-12-14T12:01:48.444Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:ffa805c8c9e54ce1561c56cc43eee4a7d8b87ac6","dn":"A Map for Wrecked Girls by Jessica Taylor EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"ffa805c8c9e54ce1561c56cc43eee4a7d8b87ac6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,168,5,200,201,229,76,225,86,28,86,204,67,238,228,167,216,184,122,198]},"name":"A Map for Wrecked Girls by Jessica Taylor EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
