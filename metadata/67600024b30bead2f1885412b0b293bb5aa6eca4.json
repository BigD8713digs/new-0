In The Contractor: How I Landed in a Pakistani Prison and Ignited a Diplomatic Crisis, Davis offers an up-close and personal look at the 2011 incident in Lahore, Pakistan, that led to his imprisonment and the events that took place as diplomats on both sides of the bargaining table scrambled to get him out.\r\n\r\nHow did a routine drive turn into front-page news? Davis dissects the incident before taking readers on the same journey he endured while trapped in the Kafkaesque Pakistani legal system. As a veteran security contractor, Davis had come to terms with the prospect of dying long before the January 27, 2011 shooting, but nothing could prepare him for being a political pawn in a game with the highest stakes imaginable.\r\n\r\nAn eye-opening memoir, The Contractor takes the veil off Raymond Davis&apos;s story and offers a sober reflection on the true cost of the War on Terror.\r\n\r\nHardcover: 224 pages\r\nPublisher: BenBella Books (June 27, 2017)\r\nLanguage: English\r\nISBN-10: 1941631843\r\nISBN-13: 978-1941631843\r\n <a href=\"\nhttps://www.amazon.co.uk/Contractor-Landed-Pakistani-Ignited-Diplomatic-ebook/dp/B01EEQ9DBM/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://www.amazon.co.uk/Contractor-Landed-Pakistani-Ignited-Diplomatic-ebook/dp/B01EEQ9DBM/</a>","last_updated":"2017-07-03T12:00:22.850Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:67600024b30bead2f1885412b0b293bb5aa6eca4","dn":"The Contractor: How I Landed in a Pakistani Prison and Ignited a","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"67600024b30bead2f1885412b0b293bb5aa6eca4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,96,0,36,179,11,234,210,241,136,84,18,176,178,147,187,90,166,236,164]},"name":"The Contractor: How I Landed in a Pakistani Prison and Ignited a","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
