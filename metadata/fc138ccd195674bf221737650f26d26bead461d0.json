Using algorithms in your programming allows you to improve the efficiency, performance, speed, and scalability of your code/applications/programs.  You will learn what algorithms are, why they are important, and how to code them out in JavaScript.  You will also learn other important programming concepts along the way such as functional programming, time complexity, recursion, and other important concepts, because you will be implementing them in the algorithms that you build throughout this course.  This course also heavily uses diagrams and animations to help make understanding the material easier.This course is also very good for anyone who is interviewing for developer/engineering jobs at both large and small companies.  Interviewers will very often ask candidates to write algorithms out in code, and this course will prepare you very well to do that.  If you have recently graduated from a coding bootcamp or are currently looking for a job, you will find this course to be beneficial.  Knowing algorithms will absolutely help you to excel in technical interviews.\r\n\r\nWho is the target audience?\r\n    Anyone who wants to learn how to code out algorithms in JavaScript\r\n    Anyone who wants to learn how to implement algorithms in their applications\r\n    Anyone who is currently, or will be interviewing for engineering/developer roles and wants to be well prepared for technical interview questions\r\n    Anyone who already knows algorithms but needs a refresher\r\n    Anyone who wants to strengthen their computer science fundamentals\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n    Basic javascript knowledge &#x2013; this course teaches algorithms from the ground up\r\n    Intermediate JavaScript Algorithmic Scripting","last_updated":"2018-07-18T12:05:25.590Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc138ccd195674bf221737650f26d26bead461d0","dn":"Udemy - 2019 JavaScript Algorithmic Scripting: Advanced Level","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"fc138ccd195674bf221737650f26d26bead461d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,19,140,205,25,86,116,191,34,23,55,101,15,38,210,107,234,212,97,208]},"name":"Udemy - 2019 JavaScript Algorithmic Scripting: Advanced Level","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
