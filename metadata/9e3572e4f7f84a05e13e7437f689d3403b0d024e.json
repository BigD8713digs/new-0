But the second the Brits open their mouths, all bets are off. So don&apos;t dream of visiting the UK, dating a Brit, or truly understanding what Jude Law is saying without this handy, hilarious, and informative guide to Britspeak. With the cheekiness of Austin Powers and the tidbit quotient of Schott&apos;s Miscellany, screenwriter Jonathan Bernstein&apos;s collection of Cockney rhyming slang, insults culled from British television shows of yore, and regional and &#x201C;high British&quot; favorites provides hours of educational, enlightening, even life saving hilarity. And if it doesn&apos;t accomplish that, at least you&apos;ll be aware that when a British citizen describes you as a &#x201C;wally,&quot; a &#x201C;herbert,&quot; a &#x201C;spanner,&quot; or a &#x201C;bampot,&quot; he&apos;s not showering you with compliments. Knickers in a Twist is as indispensable as a London city guide, as spot-on funny as an episode of The Office, and as edifying as Born to Kvetch and Eats, Shoots and Leaves","last_updated":"2018-09-02T12:13:19.248Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e3572e4f7f84a05e13e7437f689d3403b0d024e","dn":"Knickers in a Twist by Jonathan Bernstein (.epub)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"9e3572e4f7f84a05e13e7437f689d3403b0d024e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,53,114,228,247,248,74,5,225,62,116,55,246,137,211,64,59,13,2,78]},"name":"Knickers in a Twist by Jonathan Bernstein (.epub)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
