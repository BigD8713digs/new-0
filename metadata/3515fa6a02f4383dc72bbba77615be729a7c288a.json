Writing under pseudonyms, the McKenna brothers provided simple, reliable, and productive methods for magic mushroom propagation, including black-and-white photographs that showed the techniques of the time. The development of more modern cultivation techniques does not eclipse the cultural contributions of this book. Philosophical asides, whimsical illustrations evoking the mystical nature of mushrooms, and speculations about the relationship of these organisms to humankind provide a lasting legacy. Truly the classic manual on home cultivation, the wisdom of Psilocybin: Magic Mushroom Grower&apos;s Guide continues to inspire new students of psycho-mycology&#x2014;and refreshes psychedelic memories for others","last_updated":"2017-09-28T12:07:38.162Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:3515fa6a02f4383dc72bbba77615be729a7c288a","dn":"Psilocybin: Magic Mushroom Grower's Guide: A Handbook for Psiloc","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"3515fa6a02f4383dc72bbba77615be729a7c288a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,21,250,106,2,244,56,61,199,43,187,167,118,21,190,114,154,124,40,138]},"name":"Psilocybin: Magic Mushroom Grower's Guide: A Handbook for Psiloc","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
