Displaced from her community and her home, Ettie tries to find her place in this new life, but can&apos;t seem to get it right. She irritates the maid, hangs food outside the window because she mistrusts the fridge and, in her naivety and loneliness, invites a prostitute in for tea.\r\n\r\nIza&#x2019;s Ballad is the story of a woman who loses her life&#x2019;s companion and a mother trying to get close to a daughter whom she has never truly known. It is about the meeting of the old-fashioned and the modern worlds and the beliefs we construct over a lifetime","last_updated":"2018-01-08T12:06:28.589Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:84d893e051215c055bbaf5420199be367d3cc0d9","dn":"Magda Szabo - Iza's Ballad (epub)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"84d893e051215c055bbaf5420199be367d3cc0d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,216,147,224,81,33,92,5,91,186,245,66,1,153,190,54,125,60,192,217]},"name":"Magda Szabo - Iza's Ballad (epub)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
