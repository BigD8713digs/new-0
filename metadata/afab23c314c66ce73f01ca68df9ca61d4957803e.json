Virtually every selection is memorable, with &quot;What Is There to Say,&quot; &quot;Just in Time,&quot; &quot;Festive Minor,&quot; &quot;My Funny Valentine,&quot; and &quot;Utter Chaos&quot; being the high points. \r\nHighly recommended both to Mulligan collectors and to jazz listeners who are just discovering the great baritonist.
