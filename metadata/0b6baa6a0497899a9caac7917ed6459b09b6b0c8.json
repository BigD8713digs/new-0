Szeth, a Shin man cast out by his people and condemned to obey his constantly changing masters, is sent to murder the king of one of the world&apos;s most powerful nations, Alethkar. As the story progresses, he continuously changes hands, doing his best to hide the fact that he possesses a Shardblade, a magical blade given to the Knights Radiant that can cut through any material. He also possesses an ability to bind things together for a certain amount of time (&#x201C;Surgebinding&#x201D;), once possessed by the Knights Radiant and thought lost, making him incredibly difficult to defeat in battle","last_updated":"2017-07-09T12:02:09.692Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b6baa6a0497899a9caac7917ed6459b09b6b0c8","dn":"Brandon Sanderson - The Way of Kings","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"0b6baa6a0497899a9caac7917ed6459b09b6b0c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,107,170,106,4,151,137,154,156,170,199,145,126,214,69,155,9,182,176,200]},"name":"Brandon Sanderson - The Way of Kings","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
