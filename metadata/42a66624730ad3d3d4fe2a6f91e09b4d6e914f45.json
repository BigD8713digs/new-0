An amazing wealth of period detail, heart-racing action, and engaging characters enable you to fully experience the 19th-century&#x2018;s romance with the mystery of the Arctic. In hope of making his reputation, scholar-naturalist Erasmus Darwin Wells embarks on a perilous expedition to the North Pole. Through his eyes, you witness the terrible beauty of the Arctic, with its looming icebergs, endless winters and exotic &#x201C;Eskimaux.&#x201D;\r\n\r\nAs the Narwhal&#x2019;s voyage threatens to metamorphose into one man&#x2019;s maniacal quest, Erasmus&#x2019; worst fears of failure seem to be realized. Andrea Barrett, whose own romance with the Arctic began at an early age, is celebrated for her scientific protagonists and impeccably researched fiction. George Guidall&#x2019;s inspired performance of this stunning novel invites you to take your own soul-enhancing voyage to the last wild, unexplored regions.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-06-17T12:05:36.071Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:42a66624730ad3d3d4fe2a6f91e09b4d6e914f45","dn":"The Voyage of the Narwhal by Andrea Barrett EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"42a66624730ad3d3d4fe2a6f91e09b4d6e914f45","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,166,102,36,115,10,211,211,212,254,42,111,145,224,155,77,110,145,79,69]},"name":"The Voyage of the Narwhal by Andrea Barrett EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
