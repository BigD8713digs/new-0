As pilots, marines, and sailors fought for supremacy in Guadalcanal, Bougainville, and the Slot, a lonely group of radio operators occupied the Solomon Islands&apos; highest points. Sometimes encamped in comfort, sometimes exposed to the elements, these coastwatchers kept lookout for squadrons of Japanese bombers headed for Allied positions, holding their own positions even when enemy troops swarmed all around.   \r\n\r\nThey were Australian-born but Solomon-raised, and adept at survival in the unforgiving jungle environment. Through daring and insight, they stayed one step ahead of the Japanese, often sacrificing themselves to give advance warning of an attack.  \r\n\r\nIn Lonely Vigil, Walter Lord, the number one New York Times best-selling author of A Night to Remember and The Miracle of Dunkirk, tells of the survivors of the campaign and what they risked to win the war in the Pacific.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-09-19T12:57:16.916Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3eb140d6e80ccb5004c632a3ad5d5c9515f14d8","dn":"Lonely Vigil: Coastwatchers of the Solomons by Walter Lord EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"d3eb140d6e80ccb5004c632a3ad5d5c9515f14d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,235,20,13,110,128,204,181,0,76,99,42,58,213,213,201,81,95,20,216]},"name":"Lonely Vigil: Coastwatchers of the Solomons by Walter Lord EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
