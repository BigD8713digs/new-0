A historical novel, Encounters Unforeseen: 1492 Retold now dramatizes these events from a bicultural perspective, fictionalizing the beliefs, thoughts, and actions of the Native Americans who met Columbus side by side with those of Columbus and other Europeans, all based on a close reading of Columbus&apos;s Journal, other primary sources, and anthropological studies","last_updated":"2018-09-08T12:24:39.699Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:930ce2903bc4787c91181da335542c4308f826be","dn":"Encounters Unforeseen by Andrew Rowen (.epub)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"930ce2903bc4787c91181da335542c4308f826be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,12,226,144,59,196,120,124,145,24,29,163,53,84,44,67,8,248,38,190]},"name":"Encounters Unforeseen by Andrew Rowen (.epub)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
