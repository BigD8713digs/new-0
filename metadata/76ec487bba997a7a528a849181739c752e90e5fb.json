Tyler Florence educates the teams on Medjool dates, which are grown in the area, and each team pits a pound of dates and sprints off in their truck. Then Tyler calls with another challenge: Each truck must create and sell an original date dish to be judged by date growers Albert Keck and Melinda Dougherty. Sales spike during the festival, and the race is neck and neck, but only two trucks move on to the finale.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal Air Date: 23-Aug-2018","last_updated":"2018-08-25T12:11:17.113Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:76ec487bba997a7a528a849181739c752e90e5fb","dn":"The.Great.Food.Truck.Race.S09E05.Firsts.480p.WEB-DL.x264-RM","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"76ec487bba997a7a528a849181739c752e90e5fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,236,72,123,186,153,122,122,82,138,132,145,129,115,156,117,46,144,229,251]},"name":"The.Great.Food.Truck.Race.S09E05.Firsts.480p.WEB-DL.x264-RM","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
