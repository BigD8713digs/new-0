The 1981 film version of this tome was evidently meant to be taken seriously, but the operatic direction by Frank Perry and the over-the-top portrayal of Joan Crawford by Faye Dunaway (whose makeup is remarkable) has always seemed to inspire loud laughter whenever and where-ever the film is shown. According to the film (and the book that preceded it), Joan Crawford was a licentious, child-beating behemoth, who stalked and postured through life as though it was one of her own pictures-more Strait-jacket than Mildred Pierce. This is the film with the notorious &quot;wire coat hanger&quot; scene, just in case you need a reminder. Surprisingly, one emerges from Mommie Dearest with more sympathy for the monstrous but intensely vulnerable Crawford than for her whining daughter (played as an adult by Diana Scarwid, and as a child by Mara Hobel). Our favorite scene: Joan Crawford dazedly replacing her ailing daughter in the cast of a daytime TV soap opera.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTARS.........: Faye Dunaway, Diana Scarwid, Steve Forrest\r\nDIRECTOR......: Frank Perry\r\nWRITERS.......: Robert Getchell, Tracy Hotchner, Frank Perry, Frank Yablans\r\nGENRE.........: Biography, Drama\r\nIMDB RATING...: 6.7/10  11,784 votes\r\nIMDB LINK.....: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082766\r\nRUNTIME.......: 2h 06mn\r\nSIZE..........: 3.39 GB\r\nVIDEO CODEC...: HEVC (<a class=\"__cf_email__\" href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection\" data-cfemail=\"5914383037686919156d\">[email&#xA0;protected]</a><script data-cfhash=\"f9e31\" type=\"text/javascript\">/* <![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName('script'),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute('data-cfhash'))return t[e]}();if(t&&(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute('data-cfemail')){for(e='',r='0x'+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+='%'+('0'+('0x'+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]> */</script>)\r\nRESOLUTION....: 1920x1080\r\nASPECT RATIO..: 1.77:1\r\nBITRATE.......: 3500 Kbps (2-pass)\r\nFRAMERATE.....: 23.976 fps\r\nAUDIO.........: English E-AC3 3.0 256kbps\r\nSUBTITLES.....: ENG\r\nCHAPTERS......: Yes\r\nSOURCE........: Mommie.Dearest.1981.1080p.WEBRip.DD5.1.x264-NTb\r\nENCODED BY....: Sartre\r\nENCODE DATE...: 2017-07-29","last_updated":"2017-08-05T12:04:54.981Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:08c0f636562d2718aeb531713265906e0d3d004c","dn":"Mommie.Dearest.1981.1080p.WebRip.10Bit.HEVC.EAC3-SARTRE","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"08c0f636562d2718aeb531713265906e0d3d004c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,192,246,54,86,45,39,24,174,181,49,113,50,101,144,110,13,61,0,76]},"name":"Mommie.Dearest.1981.1080p.WebRip.10Bit.HEVC.EAC3-SARTRE","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
