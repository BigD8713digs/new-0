While these bridges might well have been enough, Jamaican music itself had undergone a metamorphosis with the appearance of dancehall, ragamuffin, and computer styles that more and more pushed reggae and dub into more tightly programmed arrangements. The resulting unchecked cross-pollination resulted in a flavor of dub that was new and punchy; as often as not, the basic rhythm simply kept going and going, while performers and engineers worked on the other sounds and tossed in a major dollop of synthesizer squalling for good measure. \r\nThis two-disc set provides the listener with a variety of approaches, including a couple of more traditional efforts such as Zion Train&apos;s &quot;Follow Like Wolves.&quot; In a number of other cases, the point is less hewing to anything like traditional dub rhythms; the method is the issue (the connection made by Laswell, who applies dub methodology in whatever context he likes). Alas, more than a little space is given up to more traditional techno, trip-hop, and trance, losing the dub aspect in the process. The System 7, Astralasia, and Eat Static entries definitely don&apos;t fit with the genre. \r\nOverall, however, this is a good selection of artists and cuts drawn from many of the more interesting labels (such as On-U Sound.)
