These five characters know they&apos;re at the center of a global controversy and yet they continue to work there under extremely arduous physical conditions for long hours for extended periods without a single day off.

A documentary unlike any other, Oil Sands Karaoke will make us laugh, sing along, and perhaps re-examine our biases","last_updated":"2017-08-06T12:03:45.322Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e3bbb7d461d9ac11a07cd9b29a91aa45657e4b0","dn":"Oil Sands Karaoke.mp4","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"3e3bbb7d461d9ac11a07cd9b29a91aa45657e4b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,59,187,125,70,29,154,193,26,7,205,155,41,169,26,164,86,87,228,176]},"name":"Oil Sands Karaoke.mp4","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
