In The Future Is History, she follows the lives of four people born at what promised to be the dawn of democracy. Each came of age with unprecedented expectations, some as the children and grandchildren of the very architects of the new Russia, each with newfound aspirations of their own - as entrepreneurs, activists, thinkers, and writers, sexual and social beings. Gessen charts their paths not only against the machinations of the regime that would crush them all but also against the war it waged on understanding itself, ensuring the unobstructed reemergence of the old Soviet order in the form of today&apos;s terrifying and seemingly unstoppable mafia state.\r\n\r\nPowerful and urgent, The Future Is History is a cautionary tale for our time and for all time.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-10-04T12:03:45.723Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:4fd5967d27d65c880ff4c530a95299e3f884eacf","dn":"The Future Is History_ How Totalitarianism Reclaimed Russia by M","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"4fd5967d27d65c880ff4c530a95299e3f884eacf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,213,150,125,39,214,92,136,15,244,197,48,169,82,153,227,248,132,234,207]},"name":"The Future Is History_ How Totalitarianism Reclaimed Russia by M","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
