It is a remake of Counter-Strike, the 1999 modification of Half-Life. Built on the Source engine, the game was released in 2004 along with Half-Life 2. The game is the most played Half-Life 2 mod, according to GameSpy.\r\n\r\nAs in the original version, Counter-Strike: Source games pit a team of counter-terrorists against a team of terrorists in a series of rounds. Each round is won by either completing a mission (such as detonating a bomb or rescuing hostages) or by eliminating all members of the opposing team. Unlike Half-Life: Source, the game is a complete remake instead of a port with additional content.\r\n\r\nFeatures of distribution:\r\n- Do not cut and not recoded\r\n- Based on the license\r\n- Version game: (b4014252 / v89)\r\n- Emulator RevEmu updated to latest version\r\n- Installation time 5-7 minutes.\r\n\r\nInstallation and start:\r\n1.
