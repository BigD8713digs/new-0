In this profound new book, Korten shares the results of his search for a story that reflects the fullness of human knowledge and understanding and provides a guide to action adequate to the needs of our time.\r\n\r\nKorten calls our current story &quot;Sacred Money and Markets.&quot; Money, it tells us, is the measure of all worth and the source of all happiness. Earth is simply a source of raw materials. Inequality and environmental destruction are unfortunate but unavoidable. Although many recognize that this story promotes bad ethics, bad science, and bad economics, it will remain our guiding story until it&apos;s replaced by one that aligns with our deepest understanding of the universe and our relationship to it.\r\n\r\nTo guide our path to a viable human future, Korten offers a &quot;Sacred Life and Living Earth&quot; story grounded in a cosmology that affirms we are living beings born of a living Earth itself born of a living universe. Our health and well-being depend on an economy that works in partnership with the processes by which Earth&apos;s community of life maintains the conditions of its own existence--and ours. Offering a hopeful vision, Korten lays out the transformative impact adopting this story will have on every aspect of human life and society.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-09-12T12:00:27.624Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9473f84ffc371587616368863b4ee432c50267b","dn":"Change the Story, Change the Future_ A Living Economy for a Livi","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"d9473f84ffc371587616368863b4ee432c50267b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,71,63,132,255,195,113,88,118,22,54,136,99,180,238,67,44,80,38,123]},"name":"Change the Story, Change the Future_ A Living Economy for a Livi","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
