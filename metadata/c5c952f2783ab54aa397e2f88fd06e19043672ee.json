So bloody unfair to our folks!\r\n\r\nplease seed if you please\r\n\r\nMichael Rizzo Chessman\r\n(moviesbyrizzo)","last_updated":"2018-11-15T13:03:16.303Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:c5c952f2783ab54aa397e2f88fd06e19043672ee","dn":"Marilyn Monroe The Final Days Documentary H.264 (moviesbyrizzo)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"c5c952f2783ab54aa397e2f88fd06e19043672ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,201,82,242,120,58,181,74,163,151,226,248,143,208,110,25,4,54,114,238]},"name":"Marilyn Monroe The Final Days Documentary H.264 (moviesbyrizzo)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
