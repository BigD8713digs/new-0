Can an intelligent, educated person really believe the Bible? Or do the atheists have it right? In his new book, best-selling author Dinesh D&apos;Souza ( What&apos;s So Great about America) investigates both Christianity and atheism and their influences on culture to show why there is, indeed, something great about Christianity.\r\n\r\nChallenging the assumptions of both believers and doubters, D&apos;Souza demonstrates: how Christianity created the framework for modern science and is compatible with the theory of evolution; how Christianity explains consciousness and free will, which atheists have to deny; and why, against all expectations, Christianity is the fastest-growing religion in the world, while secularism and atheism are on the decline. He argues that, ultimately, you can&apos;t have Western civilization without the Christianity that gave it birth.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-07-01T12:14:05.727Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:e4d6a92d782e72536bbae10b27970ebc9caaecec","dn":"What's So Great About Christianity by Dinesh D'Souza MOBI","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"e4d6a92d782e72536bbae10b27970ebc9caaecec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,214,169,45,120,46,114,83,107,186,225,11,39,151,14,188,156,170,236,236]},"name":"What's So Great About Christianity by Dinesh D'Souza MOBI","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
