Shaw, Agnes Lee\r\nFormat: PDF\r\nPublisher: CRC Press; 5 edition (July 26, 2016)\r\nLanguage: English\r\nISBN: 978-1482249767\r\n\r\nOphthalmic Nursing provides an overview for those just setting out in a role within ophthalmic nursing. It includes basic and comprehensible anatomy and physiology &#x2013; the foundations for understanding how the eye functions and why and how problems occur &#x2013; and relates them to the care and needs of the patient.\r\n\r\nThis accessible text includes evidence-based procedure guidelines and the inclusion of reflective activities in most chapters allows readers to apply their knowledge to the realities of the care setting. Also covered are the most recent National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines for glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration.\r\n\r\nSince the publication of the fourth edition, there have been many advances in the care and management of the ophthalmic patient. The authors have updated the chapters accordingly and included new colour images and diagrams. References, further reading and websites have also been updated to reflect current trends. A valuable resource for nurses in practice and training, this book continues to be the &#x2018;go-to&#x2019; source for those caring for the ophthalmic patient","last_updated":"2017-06-15T12:02:19.967Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:73fbc71687a5a4316674daf2edc87a45116999bb","dn":"Ophthalmic Nursing, 5th Edition [2016] [PDF]","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"73fbc71687a5a4316674daf2edc87a45116999bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,251,199,22,135,165,164,49,102,116,218,242,237,200,122,69,17,105,153,187]},"name":"Ophthalmic Nursing, 5th Edition [2016] [PDF]","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
