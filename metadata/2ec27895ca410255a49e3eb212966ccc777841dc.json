Bogaerts, K.S. Agema (Elsevier, 1992).pdf\r\n\r\nElsevier Science B.V., the world&apos;s largest scientific publisher, and the National Association of Corrosion Engineers (NACE), the world&apos;s largest publisher of corrosion technology, are proud to announce the Active Library&#xAE; on Corrosion, a novel hypertext/CD-ROM product, edited by W. Bogaert and K. Agema. The Active Library&#xAE; on Corrosion has been developed by Elsevier as part of one of the projects of ESPRIT, the European Strategic Programme for Research and Development in Information Technology.\r\nPRODUCT DESCRIPTION\r\n\r\nThe Active Library&#xAE; on Corrosion (ALC) presents a vast amount of\r\npractical corrosion information, consisting of text and graphics (including hundreds of full-color photographs), which you can access through hypertext linking.\r\n\r\nThe ALC contains several numerical and textual databases, which can be accessed via the unique reference cube and via various search options. The ALC allows you (1) to select screen sequences for storage in document trails which can be retrieved afterwards, (2) make annotations to information screens via the sticky note editor, and (3) to print the documents selected by you.\r\n\r\nAUDIENCE\r\n\r\nThe Active Library&#xAE; on Corrosion is aimed primarily at the individual corrosion engineer, but will also prove to be an indispensable educational tool for courses on corrosion, as well as an invaluable reference for scientific and technical personnel who deal with any corrosion topic. The unique user interface and functions of the ALC will also be of great interest to students and researchers in the fields of hypertext, media technology and information retrieval","last_updated":"2017-06-15T12:06:43.000Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ec27895ca410255a49e3eb212966ccc777841dc","dn":"Active Library&reg; on Corrosion - Manual","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"2ec27895ca410255a49e3eb212966ccc777841dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,194,120,149,202,65,2,85,164,158,62,178,18,150,108,204,119,120,65,220]},"name":"Active Library&reg; on Corrosion - Manual","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
