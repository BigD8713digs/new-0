Enlisting the help of Aaron Levy, an American graduate student as impatient as he is charming, and in a race with another fast-moving team of historians, Helen embarks on one last project: to determine the identity of the documents&apos; scribe, the elusive &quot;Aleph&quot;.\r\n\r\nElectrifying and ambitious, sweeping in scope and intimate in tone, The Weight of Ink is a sophisticated work of historical fiction about women separated by centuries, and the choices and sacrifices they must make in order reconcile the life of the heart and mind.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-09-02T12:06:54.526Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:2456ffcc50f56c6987a6600c6ffb431d5476805f","dn":"The Weight of Ink by Rachel Kadish ePUB eBOOK-ZAK","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"2456ffcc50f56c6987a6600c6ffb431d5476805f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,86,255,204,80,245,108,105,135,166,96,12,111,251,67,29,84,118,128,95]},"name":"The Weight of Ink by Rachel Kadish ePUB eBOOK-ZAK","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
