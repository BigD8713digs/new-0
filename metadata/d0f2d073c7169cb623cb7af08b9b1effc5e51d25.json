Players will explore never-before-seen areas of\r\nthe Aperture Science Labs and be reunited with GLaDOS, the occasionally\r\nmurderous computer companion who guided them through the original game.\r\n\r\nThe games two-player cooperative mode features its own entirely\r\nseparate campaign with a unique story, test chambers, and two new\r\nplayer characters. This new mode forces players to reconsider\r\neverything they thought they knew about portals. Success will require\r\nthem to not just act cooperatively, but to think cooperatively","last_updated":"2018-04-18T15:42:27.518Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0f2d073c7169cb623cb7af08b9b1effc5e51d25","dn":"Portal.2-SKIDROW","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"d0f2d073c7169cb623cb7af08b9b1effc5e51d25","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,242,208,115,199,22,156,182,35,203,122,240,139,155,30,255,197,229,29,37]},"name":"Portal.2-SKIDROW","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
