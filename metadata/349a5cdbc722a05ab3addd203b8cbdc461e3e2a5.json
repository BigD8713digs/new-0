Whether they&apos;re high-tech or arty, amusing or amazing, each toilet has a photo and a description of its location. More than 100 restrooms to remember are featured, from Antarctica to Zambia.\r\nAs any experienced traveller knows, you can tell a whole lot about a place by its bathrooms. Whatever you prefer to call them - lavatory, loo, bog, khasi, thunderbox, dunny, bathroom, restroom, washroom or water closet - toilets are a (sometimes opaque, often wide-open) window into the secret soul of a destination.\r\nIt&apos;s not just how well they&apos;re looked after that&apos;s revealing, but where they are positioned and the way they&apos;ve been conceptualised, designed and decorated. Toilets so often transcend their primary function of being a convenience to become a work of art in their own right, or to make a cultural statement about the priorities, traditions and values of the venues, locations and communities they serve.\r\nThe lavatory is a great leveller - everyone feels the call of nature, every day - but being ubiquitous doesn&apos;t make it uniform. Around the planet (and beyond it, see page 12), toilets have followed various evolutionary pathways to best suit their environment.\r\nIn these pages you&apos;ll find porcelain pews with fantastic views, audacious attention-seeking urban outhouses, and eco-thrones made from sticks and stones in all sorts of wild settings, from precipitous mountain peaks to dusty deserts. So, wherever you&apos;re reading this, we hope you&apos;re sitting comfortably.\r\n <a href=\"\nhttps://s26.postimg.org/j97690gt5/A_Spotter_s_Guide_to_Toilets_Lonely_Planet.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://s26.postimg.org/j97690gt5/A_Spotter_s_Guide_to_Toilets_Lonely_Planet.jpg</a>","last_updated":"2017-09-21T12:07:11.121Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:349a5cdbc722a05ab3addd203b8cbdc461e3e2a5","dn":"A Spotter's Guide to Toilets (Lonely Planet)(gnv64)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"349a5cdbc722a05ab3addd203b8cbdc461e3e2a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,154,92,219,199,34,160,90,179,173,221,32,59,140,189,196,97,227,226,165]},"name":"A Spotter's Guide to Toilets (Lonely Planet)(gnv64)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
