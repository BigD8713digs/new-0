Power up prototypes with voice. Automatically resize elements for different screens. Create amazing animations between artboards without timelines. It&#x2019;s everything you need for what&#x2019;s next in UX &#x2014; and it&#x2019;s only in XD.\r\n\r\nDesign, prototype, share &#x2014; all in XD.\r\nSwitch from design to prototype mode in a click, then drag wires between artboards to create interactive prototypes. Make changes on the fly and see them on your phone. Share securely with your team and developers for fast feedback and easy hand-off to production.\r\n\r\nPowered by creativity and community.\r\nThe XD platform is getting bigger and better all the time, thanks to users like you and our developer community. Take your experiences further with plugins. Integrate with Slack, JIRA, Microsoft Teams, and more of the apps you use every day. The best part? You can access all your add-ons from right inside XD.\r\n\r\nMade better by Adobe.\r\nXD is part of Creative Cloud, so it integrates with many of the Adobe apps you know and love, like Photoshop, Illustrator and After Effects. And it&#x2019;s built to give you the same screaming-fast performance on both Mac and Windows. Work for an enterprise? We&#x2019;ve got you covered with simple deployment, easy management, and secure collaboration features","last_updated":"2018-10-23T12:12:23.345Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:75ffd5a7a1e4b247502d8c61deb464069a074d34","dn":"Adobe XD CC 2019 13.0.12 (x64) Multilingual Pre-Activated[BabuPC","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"75ffd5a7a1e4b247502d8c61deb464069a074d34","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,255,213,167,161,228,178,71,80,45,140,97,222,180,100,6,154,7,77,52]},"name":"Adobe XD CC 2019 13.0.12 (x64) Multilingual Pre-Activated[BabuPC","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
