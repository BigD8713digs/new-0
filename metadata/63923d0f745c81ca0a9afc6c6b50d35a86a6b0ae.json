Surely this saves money for developers, as sales of hardcore racing sims have dwindled since the heydays of Formula One and NASCAR.\r\n\r\nInto this rather quiet genre, Invictus introduces Cross Racing Championship 2005. Having the word &quot;Cross&quot; in it suggests that this is a Rally Cross style title with lots of off-road vehicles trading paint in the dirt. Indeed, much of the game is exactly that. But the box flap also promises: &quot;autocross, rallycross, off-road, rally-sprint, rally, road racing, and circuit racing&quot;.\r\n\r\nCross Racing Championship 2005 is not as hardcore as a NASCAR sim or the recent GTR title. But it is not an arcade pedal mashing affair, either. If you&apos;re looking for the successor to the old Monster Truck Racing series, this isn&apos;t it. Neither is it a license-stripped Rally racer with longer segments of road where you race against the clock, repair your car, and listen to a co-driver shouting out turn types","last_updated":"2018-09-30T12:10:00.787Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:63923d0f745c81ca0a9afc6c6b50d35a86a6b0ae","dn":"Cross Championship 2005","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"63923d0f745c81ca0a9afc6c6b50d35a86a6b0ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,146,61,15,116,92,129,202,10,154,252,108,107,80,211,90,134,166,176,174]},"name":"Cross Championship 2005","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
