It is a detailed analysis of individual casualties, broken down by\r\n a) background of ship,\r\n b) background of U-boat,\r\n c) attack method (surface and/or submersed),\r\n d) details of survivors and their plight at sea, and\r\n e) their rescue, recuperation and repatriation.\r\n\r\nDetailed maps and illustrations provide a human face to what were often tragic attacks with fatal consequences. Did you know that half a dozen German submarines came close enough to the Naval Operating Base in Bermuda to see Gibbs Hill? Or that hardy Canadians from a sunken trading schooner rowed and sailed their way to the remote island&#x2015;on their own? Allied pilots based in Bermuda sank two German U-Boats, rescued dozens in daring water landings, and several crashed.\r\n\r\nHardcover: 256 pages\r\nPublisher: Fonthill Media (August 23, 2017)","last_updated":"2017-08-30T12:01:28.371Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f8afa3ea40127b417593bc61cdc230c79533413","dn":"U-Boats Off Bermuda, 1940-1944","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"0f8afa3ea40127b417593bc61cdc230c79533413","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,138,250,62,164,1,39,180,23,89,59,198,28,220,35,12,121,83,52,19]},"name":"U-Boats Off Bermuda, 1940-1944","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
