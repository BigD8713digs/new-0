Dig into 100 recipes that celebrate the island&#x2019;s wonderful ingredients, from okra and jackfruit to coconut and chillies, and explore its culture through original travel photography of the country, its kitchens and its people.\r\n\r\nAbout the Authors\r\nHusband and wife Prakash and Niranjala ran award-winning Sri Lankan restaurant Elephant Walk for eight years in Hampstead, London.
