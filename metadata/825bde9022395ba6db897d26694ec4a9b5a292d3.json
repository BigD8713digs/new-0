The band would not tour again until 19 years later, when the Queen + Paul Rodgers Tour began in 2005, after the death of Freddie Mercury on 24 November 1991, and the retirement of John Deacon in 1997. The Magic Tour took in 26 dates around Europe&apos;s stadiums, in support of A Kind of Magic.\r\n\r\nIn 1987, Mercury was diagnosed as having AIDS and the band together made the decision to stop touring, making the concert at Knebworth on 9 August 1986 the last time that the four original members of Queen performed on stage together.\r\n\r\nOver a million people attended the Queen tour, making it one of the largest ever. Support acts included The Alarm, Big Country, Belouis Some, INXS, Level 42, Marillion, Gary Moore, The Bangles and Status Quo.\r\n\r\nanalogkid speaks:\r\n\r\n Almost 6000 hand loaded torrents I have shared and this is the first and only \r\nmaterial from Queen. Its fitting that one of the last performances from them would also be the very first one I post.\r\n\r\n\r\nTracklist\r\nDisk 1\r\n1. One Vision.mp3\r\n2. Tie Your Mother Down.mp3\r\n3.
