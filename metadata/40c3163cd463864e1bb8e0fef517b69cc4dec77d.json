The X-15 Rocket Plane tells the enthralling yet little-known story of the hypersonic X-15, the winged rocket ship that met this challenge and opened the way into human-controlled spaceflight.\r\n\r\nDrawing on interviews with those who were there, Michelle Evans captures the drama and excitement of, yes, rocket science: how to handle the heat generated at speeds up to Mach 7, how to make a rocket propulsion system that could throttle, and how to safely reenter the atmosphere from space and make a precision landing.\r\n\r\nThis book puts a human face on the feats of science and engineering that went into the X-15 program, many of them critical to the development of the Space Shuttle. And, finally, it introduces us to the largely unsung pilots of the X-15. By the time of the Apollo 11 moon landing, 31 American astronauts had flown into space - eight of them astronaut-pilots of the X-15. The X-15 Rocket Plane restores these pioneers, and the others who made it happen, to their rightful place in the history of spaceflight.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-09-15T12:00:28.279Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:40c3163cd463864e1bb8e0fef517b69cc4dec77d","dn":"The X-15 Rocket Plane_ Flying the First Wings into Space by Mich","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"40c3163cd463864e1bb8e0fef517b69cc4dec77d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,195,22,60,212,99,134,78,27,184,224,254,245,23,182,156,196,222,199,125]},"name":"The X-15 Rocket Plane_ Flying the First Wings into Space by Mich","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
