Kongos became an international sensation in 2013 after their propulsive debut single, &quot;Come with Me Now,&quot; burrowed its way into everything from television commercials to sporting events, and Egomaniac wastes little time in trying to replicate that formula with the equally dynamic &quot;Take It from Me.&quot; Built on a foundation of fat synth bass, jackhammer beats, and Johnny Kongos&apos; punchy accordion playing, it, along with the similarly propulsive &quot;I Don&apos;t Mind,&quot; the latter of which eschews the township accordion with some peppy Malian electric guitar work, provides Egomaniac with some of its most immediate and gratifying moments. The remaining 11 cuts take their time landing the hook, blending sharp social commentary (&quot;Autocorrect,&quot; &quot;Look at Me&quot;) with icy oscillating synths and elliptical melodies. They reward multiple spins, but ultimately lack the gravitas of the two singles. The production and execution are both top-notch, and the grooves, when they lock in, are roof-shaking, but for much of Egomaniac, Kongos can&apos;t decide if they want to be Coldplay or Rammstein, and the listener often feels a bit stuck between stations","last_updated":"2018-06-14T12:06:53.672Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d56d9c2b90f1cf377e47c1154b4717a2f8a510f","dn":"Kongos - Egomaniac (2016) [16.44 FLAC]","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"5d56d9c2b90f1cf377e47c1154b4717a2f8a510f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,86,217,194,185,15,28,243,119,228,124,17,84,180,113,122,47,138,81,15]},"name":"Kongos - Egomaniac (2016) [16.44 FLAC]","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
