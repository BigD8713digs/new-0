Relying on wonderful stories about the comedy scene in New York City in the 1970s and National Lampoon&apos;s place at the center of it, author Josh Karp chronicles how the magazine spawned a popular radio show and two long-running theatrical productions that helped launch the careers of John Belushi, Bill Murray, Chevy Chase, and Gilda Radner and that went on to inspire Saturday Night Live.\r\n\r\nThat history along with interviews conducted with more than 130 people connected to Kenney and the magazine - including Chevy Chase, John Hughes, P. J. O&apos;Rourke, Tony Hendra, Sean Kelly, Chris Miller, and Bruce McCall - and behind-the-scenes stories about the making of Animal House and Caddyshack help to capture the nostalgia, humor, and popular culture that National Lampoon still inspires.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-01-31T12:08:33.698Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a22621668ca42593bb88b239aa97400c3fa1551","dn":"A Futile and Stupid Gesture by Josh Karp MOBI","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"2a22621668ca42593bb88b239aa97400c3fa1551","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,34,98,22,104,202,66,89,59,184,139,35,154,169,116,0,195,250,21,81]},"name":"A Futile and Stupid Gesture by Josh Karp MOBI","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
