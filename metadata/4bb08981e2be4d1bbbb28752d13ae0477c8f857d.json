The nation&#x2019;s first nuclear submarine was launched and the Polaris missile system was bought. US president John F. Kennedy was assassinated, the Vietnam War escalated, the Great Train Robbers played Monopoly with real money, Sean Connery was James Bond in From Russia With Love and Kim Philby was named as the &#x2018;third man&#x2019; in the Cambridge Spy Ring.\r\n\r\nNow Cold War: Sex, Spies and Nuclear Missiles, featuring a new foreword penned by Keeler herself, exposes the spies, reveals the scandals, examines the bombs, the aircraft and the tanks, and delves into the too often ignored history of Britain&#x2019;s years as the third global nuclear superpower.\r\n\r\nDan Sharp has worked as a news journalist for 15 years, specialising in politics, crime and military history. Based in Nottinghamshire, he writes for and edits numerous publications","last_updated":"2018-01-28T12:10:49.903Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:4bb08981e2be4d1bbbb28752d13ae0477c8f857d","dn":"Cold War - Sex, Spies and Nuclear Missiles By Dan Sharp","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"4bb08981e2be4d1bbbb28752d13ae0477c8f857d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,176,137,129,226,190,77,27,187,178,135,82,209,58,224,71,124,143,133,125]},"name":"Cold War - Sex, Spies and Nuclear Missiles By Dan Sharp","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
