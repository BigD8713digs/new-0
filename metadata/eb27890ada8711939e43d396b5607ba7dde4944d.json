In the days that followed, Mark K. Shriver - along with the rest of the world - was astonished to see a pope who paid his own hotel bill, eschewed limousines, and made his home in a suite of austere rooms in a Vatican guesthouse rather than the grand papal apartment in the Apostolic Palace. By setting an example of humility and accessibility, Francis breathed new life into the Catholic Church, attracting the admiration of Catholics and non-Catholics alike.\r\n\r\nIn Pilgrimage, Shriver retraces Francis&apos; personal journey, revealing the origins of his open, unpretentious style and explaining how it revitalized Shriver&apos;s own faith and renewed his commitment to the church. To help us understand how Jorge Mario Bergoglio became Pope Francis, Shriver travels to Bergoglio&apos;s native Argentina to meet with the people who knew him as a child, as a young Jesuit priest, and as a reformist bishop. Shriver visits the confessional where Bergoglio first felt called to a faith-based life and takes us to the humble parish where the future pontiff&apos;s pastoral career began: in a church created from a converted vegetable shed in an area just outside the city of Buenos Aires. In these impoverished surroundings, Bergoglio answered Christ&apos;s call to feed the hungry, clothe the naked, and shelter the homeless, following the example set by his papal namesake, St. Francis of Assisi.\r\n\r\nIn this deeply reported yet highly personal book, Mark K. Shriver explores how Francis&apos; commitment has struck a chord in the hearts of millions who long to make faith, love, humility, and mercy part of their lives as they go out into the world to serve and learn from the most marginalized.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-08-28T12:29:06.688Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb27890ada8711939e43d396b5607ba7dde4944d","dn":"Pilgrimage by Mark K Shriver 2016 RETAiL ePUB eBOOK-DiSTRiBUTiON","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"eb27890ada8711939e43d396b5607ba7dde4944d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,39,137,10,218,135,17,147,158,67,211,150,181,96,123,167,221,228,148,77]},"name":"Pilgrimage by Mark K Shriver 2016 RETAiL ePUB eBOOK-DiSTRiBUTiON","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
