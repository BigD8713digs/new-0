These dreams foretold impending war - a war that only Helen has the power to avert. To do so, she must defy her family and betray her betrothed by fleeing the palace in the dead of night. In need of protection, she finds shelter and comfort in the arms of Theseus, son of Poseidon. With Theseus at her side, she believes she can escape her destiny. But at every turn, new dangers - violence, betrayal, extortion, threat of war - thwart Helen&apos;s plans and bar her path. Still, she refuses to bend to the will of the gods.\r\n\r\nA new take on an ancient myth, Helen of Sparta is the story of one woman determined to decide her own fate.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-07-21T12:00:38.191Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:be43b33cc796e80a970603ea5a1b84d800bd00e5","dn":"Helen of Sparta (Helen of Sparta, #1) by Amalia Carosella AZW3","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"be43b33cc796e80a970603ea5a1b84d800bd00e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,67,179,60,199,150,232,10,151,6,3,234,90,27,132,216,0,189,0,229]},"name":"Helen of Sparta (Helen of Sparta, #1) by Amalia Carosella AZW3","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
