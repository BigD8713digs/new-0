Readers will witness Jackson&apos;s campaign to recharge his career - hiring and firing managers and advisors, turning to and away from family members, fighting depression and drug dependency - while his one goal remained: to mount the most spectacular series of shows the world had ever seen. Before You Judge Me is a humanizing look at Jackson&apos;s last days","last_updated":"2017-06-15T12:01:37.073Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:afdd511f44a7469e2b761abd813780532cbe4761","dn":"Tavis Smiley - Before You Judge Me 2016 RETAiL ePUB eBOOK-DiSTRi","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"afdd511f44a7469e2b761abd813780532cbe4761","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,221,81,31,68,167,70,158,43,118,26,189,129,55,128,83,44,190,71,97]},"name":"Tavis Smiley - Before You Judge Me 2016 RETAiL ePUB eBOOK-DiSTRi","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
