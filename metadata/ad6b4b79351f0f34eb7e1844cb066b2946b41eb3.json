Devious and unpolished, the plus-sized loan analyst couldn&#x2019;t be more out of place in her new town of Santa Barbara, where the beautifully manicured women never age and the ocean views stretch farther than the million-dollar lawns. And yet her eye for the power dynamics at play in this tony community is dead accurate. \r\n\r\nKathi Wright, on the other hand, has made it her life&#x2019;s work to fit in with the plastic people who surround her. But when her husband - a wealthy bank president - dies suddenly, she&#x2019;s left with nothing. Then the FBI shows up, asking questions she can&#x2019;t answer and freezing assets she once took for granted. \r\n\r\nWhile Kathi struggles to outrun the mess caused by her husband&#x2019;s mysterious death, Crystal seems focused on her game. But why? And who are her targets? \r\n\r\nSpanning two years and told in Crystal&#x2019;s and Kathi&#x2019;s alternating voices, this tautly plotted novel reveals the power of choice and the price of revenge. \r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-09-09T12:18:33.242Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad6b4b79351f0f34eb7e1844cb066b2946b41eb3","dn":"What She Gave Away by Catharine Riggs EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"ad6b4b79351f0f34eb7e1844cb066b2946b41eb3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,107,75,121,53,31,15,52,235,126,24,68,203,6,107,41,70,180,30,179]},"name":"What She Gave Away by Catharine Riggs EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
