It keeps you on the edge of your seat. Charlie (the handsome, Jonathan Gordon) is a budding artist who is hung up on his self-centered BFF, Sebastian (Jason Ralph). The feeling is not mutual. Sebastian&apos;s life is turned upside down after a scandal puts his father in jail. When Charlie meets a hot Lebanese concert pianist, older &amp; more grounded than Sebastian there developing relationship starts to interfere with Charlie &amp; Sebastian&apos;s long time friendship. The cast is outstanding but Jonathan Gordon is the star &amp; is just about in every scene except when Sebastian meets his father in jail. It&apos;s a heartbreaking moment. Joey Kuhn&apos;s directorial debut is very impressive. Well done. Highly recommended","last_updated":"2017-10-16T12:01:02.417Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:6199ebb150a170b7df53b81a1378ad39ccf14f07","dn":"Those People (2015)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"6199ebb150a170b7df53b81a1378ad39ccf14f07","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,153,235,177,80,161,112,183,223,83,184,26,19,120,173,57,204,241,79,7]},"name":"Those People (2015)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
