The Occupation of the American Mind takes an eye-opening look at this critical exception, zeroing in on pro-Israel public relations efforts within the U.S.\r\n\r\nNarrated by Roger Waters and featuring leading observers of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and U.S. media culture, the film explores how the Israeli government, the U.S. government, and the pro-Israel lobby have joined forces, often with very different motives, to shape American media coverage of the conflict in Israel&apos;s favor. From the U.S.-based public relations campaigns that emerged in the 1980s to today, the film provides a sweeping analysis of Israel&apos;s decades-long battle for the hearts, minds, and tax dollars of the American people in the face of widening international condemnation of its increasingly right-wing policies.\r\n\r\nNarrated by Roger Waters / Featuring Amira Hass, M.J. Rosenberg, Stephen M. Walt, Noam Chomsky, Rula Jebreal, Henry Siegman, Rashid Khalidi, Rami Khouri, Yousef Munayyer, Norman Finkelstein, Max Blumenthal, Phyllis Bennis, Norman Solomon, Mark Crispin Miller, Peter Hart, and Sut Jhally.\r\n\r\nPlease share this information far and wide, burn the video to DVDs or put it on USB thumbdrives and give them out to friends, family and others.\r\n\r\nPlease seed as long as possible, at least to a ratio of 1.100, thank you :)\r\n\r\nGeneral           : The Occupation of the American Mind - Israel&apos;s Public Relations War in the United States (2016) 1080p Documentary.mp4\r\nFormat            : MPEG-4 at 1 947 kb/s\r\nLength            : 1.15 GiB for 1 h 24 min 55 s 341 ms\r\n\r\nVideo #0          : AVC at 1 811 kb/s\r\nAspect            : 1920 x 1080 (1.778) at 29.970 fps\r\n\r\nAudio #0          : AAC at 128 kb/s\r\nInfos             : 2 channels, 44.1 kHz\r\nLanguage          : en\r\n\r\nScreens: <a href=\"\nhttps://extraimage.net/images/2018/09/11/721391f256a622d183682190a0f45aea.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://extraimage.net/images/2018/09/11/721391f256a622d183682190a0f45aea.png</a> <a href=\"\nhttps://extraimage.net/images/2018/09/11/01e4bbb1777ab5a9df3c3912e1043555.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://extraimage.net/images/2018/09/11/01e4bbb1777ab5a9df3c3912e1043555.png</a> <a href=\"\nhttps://extraimage.net/images/2018/09/11/d28f4ddd5889652a29656bdbcba237a5.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://extraimage.net/images/2018/09/11/d28f4ddd5889652a29656bdbcba237a5.png</a> <a href=\"\nhttps://extraimage.net/images/2018/09/11/f0ce8e6f943b1705f84cca3f0a3eb826.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://extraimage.net/images/2018/09/11/f0ce8e6f943b1705f84cca3f0a3eb826.png</a> <a href=\"\nhttps://extraimage.net/images/2018/09/11/26268678359bb787bb467e79c5b9e394.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://extraimage.net/images/2018/09/11/26268678359bb787bb467e79c5b9e394.png</a> <a href=\"\nhttps://extraimage.net/images/2018/09/11/9b3d3be7dc7da3d1c9ea5b2d4576c6a9.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://extraimage.net/images/2018/09/11/9b3d3be7dc7da3d1c9ea5b2d4576c6a9.png</a>","last_updated":"2018-09-11T12:13:44.860Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:60b0e4c10260232e5728594ba5771ecafb98e2a5","dn":"The Occupation of the American Mind: Israel's Public Relations W","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"60b0e4c10260232e5728594ba5771ecafb98e2a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,176,228,193,2,96,35,46,87,40,89,75,165,119,30,202,251,152,226,165]},"name":"The Occupation of the American Mind: Israel's Public Relations W","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
