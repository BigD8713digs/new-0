She was riding in a truck with men when a roadside bomb destroyed the vehicle. Her body was so severely damaged, there was no possible way she could live. She vividly recounts her near-death experience when she went out of her body, to the spirit world. There it was decided that her work on Earth was not done, and with the help of spirit guides they repaired the body so she could reenter it. She retained the conscious memory of what happened, and during the time in the hospital more details returned. This is the amazing story of survival in wartime conditions. This has happened to many others in Iraq, but how many remember the spirit side of the experience?\r\n\r\nBefore this experience, Sudman was dubious about anything that smacked of the paranormal. This experience made her a believer. She shares her story here for the first time, to demonstrate that the paranormal is normal and to assist others who have had similar experiences.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-06-03T12:08:04.684Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba2633af3124ef77c3f3c492424c40a574fea885","dn":"Application of Impossible Things by Natalie Sudman EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"ba2633af3124ef77c3f3c492424c40a574fea885","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,38,51,175,49,36,239,119,195,243,196,146,66,76,64,165,116,254,168,133]},"name":"Application of Impossible Things by Natalie Sudman EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
