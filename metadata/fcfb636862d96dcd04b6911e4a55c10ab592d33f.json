By that afternoon she saw the world - quite literally - upside down. By New Year&apos;s Day, she was unable to form a coherent sentence. And after hours in the ER, days in the hospital, and multiple questions and tests, she learned that she had had a stroke.\r\n\r\nFor months Lee outsourced her memories to her notebook. It is from these memories that she has constructed this frank and compelling memoir. In a precise and captivating narrative, Lee navigates fearlessly between chronologies, weaving her childhood humiliations and joys together with the story of the early days of her marriage and then later, in painstaking, painful, and unflinching detail, her stroke and every upset, temporary or permanent, that it causes.\r\n\r\nLee processes her stroke and illuminates the connection between memory and identity in an honest, meditative, and truly funny manner, utterly devoid of self-pity. And as she recovers, she begins to realize that this unexpected and devastating event provides a catalyst for coming to terms with her true self.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-07-12T12:00:37.703Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:fcfb636862d96dcd04b6911e4a55c10ab592d33f","dn":"Christine Hyung Oak Lee - Tell Me Everything You Dont Remember 2","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"fcfb636862d96dcd04b6911e4a55c10ab592d33f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,251,99,104,98,217,109,205,4,182,145,30,74,85,193,10,181,146,211,63]},"name":"Christine Hyung Oak Lee - Tell Me Everything You Dont Remember 2","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
