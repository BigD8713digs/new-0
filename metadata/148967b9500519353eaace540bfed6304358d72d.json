Its mission is to save the Earth&apos;s ecosystem - and the biggest threat to that is humanity. But we are also part of the system, so the AI must make a choice. Should it save mankind or wipe it out? Are we worth it?The AI is all-powerful, and might as well be a god. So it sets up some conditions. Violence is now impossible. Large-scale destruction of natural resources is impossible. Food and water will be provided for those who really, truly need them. You can&apos;t even bully someone on the internet any more. The old way of doing things is gone. But a certain thin-skinned US president, among others, is still wedded to late-stage capitalism. Can we adapt? Can we prove ourselves worthy? And are we prepared to give up free will for a world without violence?And above it all, on a hidden spaceship, one woman watches. A science fiction writer, she was abducted from the middle of the street in broad daylight. She is the only person the AI will talk to. And she must make a decision","last_updated":"2018-10-20T14:16:30.122Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:148967b9500519353eaace540bfed6304358d72d","dn":"Steven Erikson-Rejoice, a Knife to the Heart [epub]","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"148967b9500519353eaace540bfed6304358d72d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,137,103,185,80,5,25,53,62,170,206,84,11,254,214,48,67,88,215,45]},"name":"Steven Erikson-Rejoice, a Knife to the Heart [epub]","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
