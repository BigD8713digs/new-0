His girlfriend wants to marry someone just like him - only richer and with a different sense of humor. He doesn&apos;t remember life being this confusing, back before everyone expected him to act like a grown up.\r\n\r\nWhen his brother asks him to look after his dogs, Jonathan&apos;s world view begins to shift. Could a Border Collie and a Cocker Spaniel have the key to life, the universe, and everything? Their sly maneuvering on daily walks and visits to the alluring vet suggest that human emotional intelligence may not be top dog after all.\r\n\r\nA funny, wise romantic comedy set in Manhattan, Jonathan Unleashed is a story of tangled relationships, friendships, and dogs. Rosoff&apos;s novel is for everyone wondering what to be when they grow up, and how on earth to get there.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-12-25T12:06:15.406Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9a4104a48f47e99b58e69edf5d981feda603f0c","dn":"Jonathan Unleashed by Meg Rosoff EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"d9a4104a48f47e99b58e69edf5d981feda603f0c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,164,16,74,72,244,126,153,181,142,105,237,245,217,129,254,218,96,63,12]},"name":"Jonathan Unleashed by Meg Rosoff EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
