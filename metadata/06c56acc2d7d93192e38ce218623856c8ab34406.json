Randy Taraborrelli EPUB\r\n\r\nThe first comprehensive biography ever published about America&apos;s favorite living pop icon, Beyonc&#xE9;, from New York Times best-selling biographer J. Randy Taraborrelli.\r\n\r\nBeyonc&#xE9; Knowles is a woman who began her career at the age of eight performing in pageant shows and talent contests, honing her craft through her teenage years until, at the age of 16, she had her first number-one record with Destiny&apos;s Child. That hit-making trio launched Beyonc&#xE9;&apos;s successful solo career, catapulting her, as of 2014, to number one on Forbes&apos; annual list of most wealthy celebrities - the same year she made the cover of Time. Becoming Beyonc&#xE9; is not only the story of struggle, sacrifice, and what it takes to make it in the cut-throat record industry; it&apos;s the story of the great rewards of such success and the devastating toll it often takes on the human spirit.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-04-16T17:06:29.394Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:06c56acc2d7d93192e38ce218623856c8ab34406","dn":"Becoming Beyonc&eacute; by J.
