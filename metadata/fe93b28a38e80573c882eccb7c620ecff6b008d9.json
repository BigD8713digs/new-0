EP has added this ability back in by combining it with the existing &quot;scrap&quot; mode of the moveables feature.\r\nThis makes it easier to hunt around for objects that can be disassembled by mousing over them instead of right-clicking on each one","last_updated":"2018-05-27T12:01:54.056Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe93b28a38e80573c882eccb7c620ecff6b008d9","dn":"Project Zomboid - IWBUMS BUILD 39.64 [ENG-RUS] Repack","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"fe93b28a38e80573c882eccb7c620ecff6b008d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,147,178,138,56,232,5,115,200,130,236,203,124,98,14,207,246,176,8,217]},"name":"Project Zomboid - IWBUMS BUILD 39.64 [ENG-RUS] Repack","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
