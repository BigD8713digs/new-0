Trump EPUB\r\n\r\nPresident-elect Donald J. Trump lays out his professional and personal worldview in this classic work&#x2014;a firsthand account of the rise of America&apos;s foremost deal-maker.\r\n\r\n&quot;I like thinking big. I always have. To me it&apos;s very simple: If you&apos;re going to be thinking anyway, you might as well think big.&quot; &#x2014;Donald J. Trump\r\n\r\nHere is Trump in action&#x2014;how he runs his organization and how he runs his life&#x2014;as he meets the people he needs to meet, chats with family and friends, clashes with enemies, and challenges conventional thinking. But even a maverick plays by rules, and Trump has formulated time-tested guidelines for success. He isolates the common elements in his greatest accomplishments; he shatters myths; he names names, spells out the zeros, and fully reveals the deal-maker&apos;s art. And throughout, Trump talks&#x2014;really talks&#x2014;about how he does it. Trump: The Art of the Deal is an unguarded look at the mind of a brilliant entrepreneur&#x2014;the ultimate read for anyone interested in the man behind the spotlight.\r\n\r\nPraise for Trump: The Art of the Deal\r\n\r\n&quot;Trump makes one believe for a moment in the American dream again.&quot; &#x2014;The New York Times\r\n\r\n&quot;Donald Trump is a deal maker.
