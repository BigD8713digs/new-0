Nova Express takes William S. Burroughs&apos; nightmarish futuristic tale one step further. The diabolical Nova Criminals - Sammy the Butcher, Green Tony, Iron Claws, the Brown Artist, Jacky Blue Note, and Izzy the Push, to name only a few - have gained control and plan on wreaking untold destruction. It&apos;s up to Inspector Lee of the Nova Police to attack and dismantle the word and imagery machine of these &quot;control addicts&quot; before it&apos;s too late.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-08-25T12:00:29.019Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:e1f268ff5541e1b7788e793fbe4deea569778c2d","dn":"Nova Express by William S Burroughs 2011 Retail EPUB eBook-BitBo","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"e1f268ff5541e1b7788e793fbe4deea569778c2d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,242,104,255,85,65,225,183,120,142,121,63,190,77,238,165,105,119,140,45]},"name":"Nova Express by William S Burroughs 2011 Retail EPUB eBook-BitBo","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
