As Jim Kerr sank further into megastardom, the music suffered further as he indulged in piously cumbersome ballads like &quot;Belfast Child&quot; and &quot;Mandela Day&quot;. \r\nBut while critics sighed, the Minds&apos; audience swelled regardless--their &quot;New Gold Dream&quot; had come true. --David Stubbs (Amazon)\r\n\r\n <a href=\"\nhttps://i.imgur.com/WTKBxaU.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://i.imgur.com/WTKBxaU.jpg</a>\r\n\r\n\r\n01.
