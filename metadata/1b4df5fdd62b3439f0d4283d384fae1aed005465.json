Dire Straits&apos; sound drew from a variety of musical influences, including jazz, folk, and blues, and came closest to beat music within the context of rock and roll. Despite the prominence of punk rock during the band&apos;s early years, their stripped-down sound contrasted with punk, demonstrating a more &quot;rootsy&quot; influence that emerged from pub rock.\r\n\r\n Many of Dire Straits&apos; compositions were melancholic.They also became one of the world&apos;s most commercially successful bands, with worldwide record sales of over 100 million. Dire Straits won four Grammy Awards, three Brit Awards&#x2014;winning Best British Group twice, two MTV Video Music Awards, and various other music awards.\r\nAccording to the Guinness Book of British Hit Albums, Dire Straits have spent over 1,100 weeks on the UK albums chart, ranking fifth all-time. \r\nTheir career spanned a total of 15 years. \r\n\r\nTracklist Disk 1\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Calling Elvis.mp3\r\n2 Walk of life.mp3\r\n3 Romeo and Juliet.mp3\r\n4 Heavy fuel.mp3\r\n5 Planet of New Orleans.mp3\r\n6 Private investigations.mp3\r\n7 Sultans of swing.mp3\r\n8 Your latest trick.mp3\r\n\r\nDisk 2\r\n\r\n1 On every street.mp3\r\n2 I think I love you too much.mp3\r\n3 Two young lovers.mp3\r\n4 Telegraph road.mp3\r\n5 Setting me up.mp3\r\n6 Money for nothing.mp3\r\n7 Brothers in arms.mp3\r\n8 Why worry.mp3\r\n9 Tunnel of love [B].mp3\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBand members\r\n\r\n\r\n    Mark Knopfler: lead vocals, guitar (1977&#x2013;1995)\r\n    John Illsley: bass, vocals, guitar (1977&#x2013;1995)\r\n    Pick Withers: drums (1977&#x2013;1982)\r\n    David Knopfler: guitar, keys, vocals (1977&#x2013;1980)\r\n    Alan Clark: keyboards, organ, piano (1980&#x2013;1995)\r\n    Hal Lindes: guitar (1980&#x2013;1985)\r\n    Terry Williams: drums (1982&#x2013;1984, 1985&#x2013;1989)\r\n    Guy Fletcher: synthesizer, keyboards, guitar, vocals (1984&#x2013;1995)\r\n    Jack Sonni: guitar (1985&#x2013;1988)\r\n    Chris White: saxophone, flute, percussion (1985&#x2013;1995)\r\n    Chris Whitten: drums (1991&#x2013;1992)\r\n    Paul Franklin: Pedal Steel Guitar (1991&#x2013;1996)\r\n    Various other personnel from 1989&#x2013;1992 as session and touring musicians","last_updated":"2017-09-10T12:09:08.579Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b4df5fdd62b3439f0d4283d384fae1aed005465","dn":"Dire Straits -The Point Depot, Strait To The Point Dublin,(Live)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"1b4df5fdd62b3439f0d4283d384fae1aed005465","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,77,245,253,214,43,52,57,240,212,40,61,56,79,174,26,237,0,84,101]},"name":"Dire Straits -The Point Depot, Strait To The Point Dublin,(Live)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
