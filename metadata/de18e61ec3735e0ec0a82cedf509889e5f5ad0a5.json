I downloaded a bunch of interesting aircraft over those years and decided that people might like it if I share some of them. I didn&apos;t crack any of these myself and I&apos;m only providing an easy way to expand your X-Plane aircraft library. Sorry if you feel like I&apos;m stealing your credit, but the crackers are hardly ever listed in the actual aircraft folders so I couldn&apos;t really list them all here. To those people, you know who you are and thank you for your work.\r\n\r\nAircraft included:\r\n\r\n737 by IXEG\r\n737NG by Zibo (freeware)\r\n787-9 by VMAX\r\nA320 by JARDesign (FlightFactor hasn&apos;t been cracked yet unfortunately)\r\nA330 by JARDesign\r\nA380 by riviere (not a very realistic model, freeware)\r\nAlphajet A\r\nATR 72-500 by Aerosoft\r\nAeroBoero AB-115\r\nBeechcraft A36 Bonanza by Carenado\r\nBeechcraft F33A Bonanza by Carenado\r\nBoeing 737 by FlyJSim\r\nBoeing 757 by FlightFactor\r\nBoeing 767 by FlightFactor\r\nBoeing 777 by FlightFactor\r\nCessna C208B Grand Caravan by Carenado\r\nCessna 206H Stationair by Carenado\r\nCessna 340 by Carenado\r\nDHC-6 Twin Otter by RWDesign\r\nDouglas DC3/C47 by VSKYLABS\r\nEmbraer E195 by XCraft\r\nLet L-410\r\nLockheed-Martin C130\r\nMcDonnel Douglas MD-80 (RotateSim)\r\nMooney M20 Juliet (Carenado)\r\nPilatus PC-12 (Carenado)\r\nPiper Archer II (Carenado)\r\nPiper Cherokee 140 (vFlyteAir)\r\nPiper J-3 Cub\r\nPiper PA-28 Arrow\r\nSaab 340A\r\nStearman Spirit of Artemis\r\nSocata TBM-850\r\nKodiak Quest by Thranda Design\r\nYakolev YAK-55M\r\n\r\nThanks to the crackers and developers!","last_updated":"2018-04-12T16:59:52.541Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:de18e61ec3735e0ec0a82cedf509889e5f5ad0a5","dn":"X-Plane 11 - Aircraft Megapack (Payware Freeware)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"de18e61ec3735e0ec0a82cedf509889e5f5ad0a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,24,230,30,195,115,94,14,192,168,44,237,245,9,136,158,95,90,208,165]},"name":"X-Plane 11 - Aircraft Megapack (Payware Freeware)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
