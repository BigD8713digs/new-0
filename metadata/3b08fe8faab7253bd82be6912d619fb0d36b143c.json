She sounds better than ever. Her version of, &quot;Stay With Me,&quot; is perhaps the finest recorded. This was a quite unique concert. It&apos;s theme is in the title. It&apos;s quite artsy. The costumes were bold and sharp. The set designs were likewise. Stand-out moments include the aforementioned, &quot;Stay With Me,&quot; &quot;Do not Look Down,&quot; and the brilliant, &quot;Here Comes the Flood.&quot; We are also treated with songs from her album release at the time. &quot;My Eye on You,&quot; really rocks, and &quot;Is it Love,&quot; is a very modern (at the time), kind of new-wave song. She went out on a limb for this show, and it really pays off. She&apos;s as raunchy and humorous as ever, giving us her standard Mermaids in wheelchairs act.\r\n\r\nCountry: USA\r\nGenre: Live Concert\r\nDuration: 1:21:31\r\nYear of manufacture: 1984.\r\nLabel: Vestron Video\r\nQuality: LazerDisc\r\nFormat: DVD video\r\nVideo codec: MPEG2\r\nAudio Codec: PCM\r\nVideo: NTSC 4: 3 (720x480) VBR\r\nAudio: English (LinearPCM, 2 ch)\r\n\r\nTracklist:\r\n01.
