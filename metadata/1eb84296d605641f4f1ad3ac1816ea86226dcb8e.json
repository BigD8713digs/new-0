But the countries along the equator are among the most troubled on the planet. In this new series Simon takes a journey around the region with the greatest natural biodiversity and perhaps the greatest concentration of human suffering: the equator. In Equator Simon meets illegal loggers, father and son circumcisers, drunk villagers, and a young woman stuck in the baking desert. Simon and the Equator film-crew are protected by soldiers in a coca field, and UN &apos;peace-enforcers&apos; in a gold mine. They are blackmailed and abandoned by drivers in one country, and travel through another that has just 300 miles of paved roads - despite being the size of Western Europe. Simon is drenched while white-water rafting, surrounded by a million flamingos and swallowed by a tidal wave. After being warned about the deadly virus Ebola, Simon vomits blood and develops a temperature of nearly 40C. Diagnosed with malaria, he&apos;s saved by medicine derived from the Vietnamese sweet wormwood. One remote tribe takes Simon to their sacred monument, while a father from another tribe of former head-hunters decides to make Simon part of the family. After presenting his &apos;father&apos; with a fine pair of trousers, Simon is blessed with blood, presented with a short sword, and adopted. Simon discovers a matrilineal society where daughters are called &apos;iron butterflies&apos;, mass graves in the jungle, and islands where protesting fisherman have killed giant tortoises. He helps an orphaned orangutan into a tree, swims with sea-lions, fishes for piranha, climbs the equivalent of half-way up Everest, and discovers the city thought to be most at risk from volcanic eruptions. Simon&apos;s trip takes him through the nation suffering the worst humanitarian crisis in the Western hemisphere, and the African country that&apos;s endured the most violent conflict on the planet since the Second World War \r\n\r\nFile Sample Name : BBC.Equator.with.Simon.Reeve.s01e01.Africa.720p.x264-MVGroup.mkv\r\nFile Size : 1525.88 MB\r\nResolution : 1280x720\r\nDuration : 00:59:09\r\nVideo : AVC (AVC), 3 476 Kbps, 25.000 fps\r\nAudio : AAC (AAC LC), 127 Kbps, 48.0 KHz, 2 channels, 1 stream\r\nSubtitles: English\r\n <a href=\"\nhttps://extraimage.net/images/2017/07/16/9b4b85183cb500d7864715a6627ba2c0.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://extraimage.net/images/2017/07/16/9b4b85183cb500d7864715a6627ba2c0.jpg</a> <a href=\"\nhttps://extraimage.net/images/2017/07/16/da605738e46bb73e811e73221c60c80d.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://extraimage.net/images/2017/07/16/da605738e46bb73e811e73221c60c80d.jpg</a>","last_updated":"2017-07-16T12:04:16.722Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:1eb84296d605641f4f1ad3ac1816ea86226dcb8e","dn":"BBC.Equator.with.Simon.Reeve.S01.PACK.720p.x264-MVGroup","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"1eb84296d605641f4f1ad3ac1816ea86226dcb8e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,184,66,150,214,5,100,31,79,26,211,172,24,22,234,134,34,109,203,142]},"name":"BBC.Equator.with.Simon.Reeve.S01.PACK.720p.x264-MVGroup","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
