In 1977, at the age of 17, Conway left his family&apos;s comfortable suburban home to move to the Appalachian Mountains. For more than two decades he has lived there, making fire with sticks, wearing skins from animals he trapped, and trying to convince Americans to give up their materialistic lifestyles and return with him back to nature.\r\n\r\nTo Gilbert, Conway&apos;s mythical character challenges all our assumptions about what it is to be a modern man in America; he is a symbol of much we feel about how our men should be, but rarely are.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-10-05T12:01:09.762Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a59a014dee6d51f69fa81eceaa6089b84ef10e1","dn":"The Last American Man by Elizabeth Gilbert ePUB eBOOK-ZAK","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"6a59a014dee6d51f69fa81eceaa6089b84ef10e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,89,160,20,222,230,213,31,105,250,129,236,234,166,8,155,132,239,16,225]},"name":"The Last American Man by Elizabeth Gilbert ePUB eBOOK-ZAK","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
