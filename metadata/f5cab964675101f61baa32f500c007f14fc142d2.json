This build has the fix for the bug that was causing some Surface Pro 3 devices to end up in a &#x201C;unbootable&#x201D; state where the Windows OS will not load and it appears to be stuck on a &#x201C;spinning dots&#x201D; screen. After installing this build, Surface Pro 3 devices should no longer get into this state. If you have a Surface Pro 3 in a bad state &#x2013; follow the instructions on this forum post to get back up and running. \r\n2. They fixed an issue on Dutch builds where explorer could go into a crash loop if an app-requested downloads notification popped up from OneDrive. \r\n3. They fixed an issue where expand.exe couldn&#x2019;t expand CABs that contained Japanese characters in the file name. \r\n4. They fixed a race condition that could result in window content being transparent (but showing the window frame) or stale after unlocking your desktop. \r\n5. They fixed an issue resulting in some Insiders seeing error 0x800B010C when attempting to upgrade to the last few flights. \r\n6.
