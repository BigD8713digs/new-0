Kasparov has distilled the lessons he learned over a lifetime as a chess grandmaster to cover the practical side - tactics, strategy, preparation, as well as the subtler, more human arts of using memory, intuition, and imagination. It&apos;s a remarkably honest book in which Kasparov, one of the world&apos;s most celebrated and successful competitors, details both his blunders and his victories, always with the intent to enable readers to absorb his lessons and do better for themselves.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-09-12T12:00:34.566Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:836c3d411282b498f5f96877f2da6a5ee8712307","dn":"How Life Imitates Chess_ Making the Right Moves, from the Board ","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"836c3d411282b498f5f96877f2da6a5ee8712307","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,108,61,65,18,130,180,152,245,249,104,119,242,218,106,94,232,113,35,7]},"name":"How Life Imitates Chess_ Making the Right Moves, from the Board ","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
