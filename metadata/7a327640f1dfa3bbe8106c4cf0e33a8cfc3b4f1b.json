A medical clairvoyant, psychic, and Christian mystic, Cayce provided medical, psychological, and spiritual advice to thousands of people who swore by the effectiveness of his trance-based readings.\r\n\r\nBut Cayce was not always a household name. When a young, skeptical journalist named Thomas Sugrue first met Cayce in 1927, the world had not yet heard of the &quot;sleeping prophet&quot;. During years of unique access, Sugrue completed his landmark biography, which on its publication in 1942 brought national attention to Cayce and stands as the sole record written during the seer&apos;s lifetime.\r\n\r\nThis edition includes a new introduction by historian Mitch Horowitz. It highlights the enduring significance of Cayce&apos;s message and the role this book played in its dissemination.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-08-31T12:00:39.857Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a327640f1dfa3bbe8106c4cf0e33a8cfc3b4f1b","dn":"There Is a River_ The Story of Edgar Cayce by Thomas Sugrue ePUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"7a327640f1dfa3bbe8106c4cf0e33a8cfc3b4f1b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,50,118,64,241,223,163,187,232,16,108,76,240,227,58,140,252,59,79,27]},"name":"There Is a River_ The Story of Edgar Cayce by Thomas Sugrue ePUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
