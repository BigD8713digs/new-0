For tens of thousands of Northern Irish Catholics it will be a once-in-a-lifetime chance - and for some lucky devotees, their second - to see and hear the Holy Father in person. In this warm and uplifting film, we explore people&apos;s relationship with the pope and how it has changed over the decades.\r\n\r\nFor most of the 20th century, it would have been difficult to find a Catholic home in Northern Ireland that didn&apos;t exhibit a picture of the pope. In fact throughout history, his Holiness has always had a very special place in the hearts of the nation&apos;s faithful. From Pope Pius XII in the 1950s through to Pope Francis today, there is no doubt that a picture of the pope has always been a source of great comfort to thousands of dedicated Catholics across the land.\r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC High L3.1\r\n * Video Bitrate: CRF 19 (~2060Kbps)\r\n * Video Resolution: 1280x720\r\n * Frame Rate: 25 FPS\r\n * Audio Codec: HE-AAC\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 64Kbps CBR 24KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: 2\r\n * Run-Time: 29 mins\r\n * Part Size: 449 MB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Subtitles: Merged","last_updated":"2018-08-16T12:01:10.497Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:255f042a403da3949cab07a6166b6697ea829ee5","dn":"BBC True North 2018 The Pope and I 720p x264 AAC HDTV MVGroup.or","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"255f042a403da3949cab07a6166b6697ea829ee5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,95,4,42,64,61,163,148,156,171,7,166,22,107,102,151,234,130,158,229]},"name":"BBC True North 2018 The Pope and I 720p x264 AAC HDTV MVGroup.or","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
