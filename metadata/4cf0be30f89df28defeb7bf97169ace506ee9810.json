Does the light just go out and that&apos;s that - the million-year nap? Or will some part of my personality, my me-ness persist? What will that feel like? What will I do all day? Is there a place to plug in my laptop?&quot; In an attempt to find out, Mary Roach brings her tireless curiosity to bear on an array of contemporary and historical soul-searchers: scientists, schemers, engineers, mediums, all trying to prove (or disprove) that life goes on after we die. She begins the journey in rural India with a reincarnation researcher and ends up in a University of Virginia operating room where cardiologists have installed equipment near the ceiling to study out-of-body near-death experiences. Along the way, she enrolls in an English medium school, gets electromagnetically haunted at a university in Ontario, and visits a Duke University professor with a plan to weigh the consciousness of a leech. Her historical wanderings unearth soul-seeking philosophers who rummaged through cadavers and calves&apos; heads, a North Carolina lawsuit that established legal precedence for ghosts, and the last surviving sample of &quot;ectoplasm&quot; in a Cambridge University archive","last_updated":"2018-08-22T12:14:52.270Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:4cf0be30f89df28defeb7bf97169ace506ee9810","dn":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife ","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"4cf0be30f89df28defeb7bf97169ace506ee9810","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,240,190,48,248,157,242,141,239,235,123,249,113,105,172,229,6,238,152,16]},"name":"Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife ","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
