When he died in the grandest house in New Orleans 69 years later, he was among the richest, most powerful men in the world. In between, he worked as a fruit peddler, banana hauler, dockside hustler, and plantation owner. He battled and conquered the United Fruit Company, becoming a symbol of the best and worst of the United States: proof America is the land of opportunity, but also a classic example of the corporate pirate who treats foreign nations as the backdrop for his adventures. Starting with nothing but a cart of freckled bananas, he built a sprawling empire of banana cowboys, mercenary soldiers, Honduran peasants, CIA agents, and American statesmen.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-10-30T12:05:33.549Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae117e02dfe93381355ad9b05d9a031a31a646f9","dn":"The Fish That Ate the Whale by Rich Cohe","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"ae117e02dfe93381355ad9b05d9a031a31a646f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,17,126,2,223,233,51,129,53,90,217,176,93,154,3,26,49,166,70,249]},"name":"The Fish That Ate the Whale by Rich Cohe","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
