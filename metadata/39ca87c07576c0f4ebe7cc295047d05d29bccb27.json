The major part of the book is devoted to the applications of plasma technology and their accompanying engineering aspects, classified by the various pressure and density regimes at which plasmas can be produced. Two chapters on plasma power supplies round off the book.\r\nWith its broad range of topics, from low to high pressure plasmas, from characterization to modeling, and from materials to components, this is suitable for advanced undergraduates, postgraduates and professionals in the field","last_updated":"2017-06-08T12:01:35.386Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:39ca87c07576c0f4ebe7cc295047d05d29bccb27","dn":"Introduction to Plasma Technology - John Ernest Harry","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"39ca87c07576c0f4ebe7cc295047d05d29bccb27","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,202,135,192,117,118,192,244,235,231,204,41,80,71,208,93,41,188,203,39]},"name":"Introduction to Plasma Technology - John Ernest Harry","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
