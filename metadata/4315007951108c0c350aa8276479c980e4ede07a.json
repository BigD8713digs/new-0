Virtual Surround is a technology which allows you to listen to music, watch movies, or play video games with surround effects using any set of two channel stereo headphones. The sources of this release are surround versions of the tracks ripped from DVD&apos;s, DVDA&apos;s, SACD&apos;s and Blu-Ray&apos;s. I&apos;ve converted them to virtual surround with Creative&apos;s BlasterX Acoustic Engine Pro. In my opinion it does a much better job than Dolby Headphone or DTS Headphone:X and with almost no impact on the original audio quality. Using state-of-the-art technology, it gives an enhanced virtual 7.1 channel surround sound experience with regular stereo headphones.\r\n\r\n\r\nTracklist:\r\n\r\n01. Chris Botti - Lisa (5:06)\r\n02.
