Ruhlman proposes that the best practices for consuming wisely could be hiding in plain sight-in the aisles of your local supermarket. Using the human story of the family-run Midwestern chain Heinen&apos;s as an anchor to this journalistic narrative, he dives into the mysterious world of supermarkets and the ways in which we produce, consume, and distribute food. Grocery examines how rapidly supermarkets-and our food and culture-have changed since the days of your friendly neighborhood grocer. But rather than waxing nostalgic for the age of mom-and-pop shops, Ruhlman seeks to understand how our food needs have shifted since the mid-twentieth century, and how these needs mirror our cultural ones.\r\n\r\nA mix of reportage and rant, personal history and social commentary, Grocery is a landmark book from one of our most insightful food writers","last_updated":"2017-06-06T12:00:47.955Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:0856cc590c34b3027a37defb0584ef067215d718","dn":"Grocery: The Buying and Selling of Food in America(2017) by Mich","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"0856cc590c34b3027a37defb0584ef067215d718","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,86,204,89,12,52,179,2,122,55,222,251,5,132,239,6,114,21,215,24]},"name":"Grocery: The Buying and Selling of Food in America(2017) by Mich","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
