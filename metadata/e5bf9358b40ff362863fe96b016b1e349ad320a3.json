Jean Carroll, the popular advice columnist for Elle magazine, comes to the rescue of bright, high-achieving women everywhere with a foolproof program for finding love. In the first Man-Finding, Catching, and Captivating Manual for successful women, E. Jean provides a 6-week plan for finding the ideal mate.\r\n\r\nAnd here&apos;s the best part: Mr. Right, Right Now! is not based on self-help horsehockey. Rather, it&apos;s founded on Darwinian principles, cutting-edge scientific research on &quot;synchrony,&quot; and ten years of hard evidence provided by thousands of letters sent into the Ask E. Jean column.\r\n\r\nThe Man Catching Theory in Mr. Right, Right Now! has been tested and confirmed on E. Jean&apos;s wildly successful dating site GreatBoyfriends.com.\r\n\r\nSo, here&apos;s the deal, Doll: If you acquire the right attitude (Week 1) and the right look (Week 2), learn to laugh at your fears (Week 3), place yourself where there are hoards of elite and eligible men (Week 4), get out of your own way and let Mother Nature hurl the chaps at your feet (Week 5), E. Jean guarantees you will live happily ever after (or for as long as you can stand it) with the man of your dreams (Week 6)","last_updated":"2018-01-28T12:10:20.965Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:e5bf9358b40ff362863fe96b016b1e349ad320a3","dn":"Mr. Right, Right Now! - How a Smart Woman Can Land Her Dream Man","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"e5bf9358b40ff362863fe96b016b1e349ad320a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,191,147,88,180,15,243,98,134,63,233,107,1,107,30,52,154,211,32,163]},"name":"Mr. Right, Right Now! - How a Smart Woman Can Land Her Dream Man","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
