Parents Phil and Claire yearn for an honest, open relationship with their three kids. But a daughter who is trying to grow up too fast, another who is too smart for her own good, and a rambunctious young son make it challenging. Claire&apos;s dad, Jay, and his Latina wife, Gloria, are raising two sons together, but people sometimes believe Jay to be Gloria&apos;s father. Jay&apos;s gay son, Mitchell, and his partner, Cameron, have adopted a little Asian girl, completing one big -- straight, gay, multicultural, traditional -- happy family.\r\n\r\nFirst episode date: 23 September 2009\r\nAwards: Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series, MORE\r\nNetworks: American Broadcasting Company, USA Network","last_updated":"2017-12-07T12:09:45.996Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a53fef71e12a336e75ab97682436b8158df032e","dn":"Modern.Family.S09E09.720p.HDTV.x264.[223MB]","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"7a53fef71e12a336e75ab97682436b8158df032e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,83,254,247,30,18,163,54,231,90,185,118,130,67,107,129,88,223,3,46]},"name":"Modern.Family.S09E09.720p.HDTV.x264.[223MB]","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
