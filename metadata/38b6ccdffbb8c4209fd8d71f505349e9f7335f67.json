Somehow, though, it still feels like something - or somewhere - is missing. So when Neptune gives the Windsnaps a mission that sends them all back to Brightport, their hometown, what could be better?\r\n\r\nBut as construction in Brightport threatens to destroy the nearby mer-town of Shiprock, Neptune&apos;s desire to have humans and mermaids come together seems impossible. Between trying to help humans and merfolk get along, sorting out her growing feelings \r\ntoward Aaron, finding some missing sirens with Shona, and dealing with her old enemies Mandy and Mr. Beeston, Emily certainly has her fins full!","last_updated":"2018-01-03T12:04:56.864Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:38b6ccdffbb8c4209fd8d71f505349e9f7335f67","dn":"EMILY WINDSNAP AND THE SIREN'S SECRET - Liz Kessler {FerraBit}","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"38b6ccdffbb8c4209fd8d71f505349e9f7335f67","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,182,204,223,251,184,196,32,159,216,215,31,80,83,73,233,247,51,95,103]},"name":"EMILY WINDSNAP AND THE SIREN'S SECRET - Liz Kessler {FerraBit}","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
