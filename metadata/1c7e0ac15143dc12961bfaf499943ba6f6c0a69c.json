However, for customers who aren&#x2019;t ready for the cloud, Office 2019 provides new features and updates to the on-premises apps for both users and IT professionals. Like Windows Long Term Servicing Channel (LTSC) releases, Office 2019 provides a set of valuable enhancements for customers who can&#x2019;t be cloud-connected or receive regular updates.\r\n\r\nThe new enhancements in Office 2019 are a subset of a long list of features that have been added to Office 365 ProPlus over the last three years. Office 2019 is a one-time release and won&#x2019;t receive future feature updates. However, we&#x2019;ll continue to add new features to Office 365 ProPlus monthly, including innovations in collaboration, artificial intelligence (AI), security, and more.\r\n\r\nOffice 2019 delivers features across apps to help users create amazing content in less time. In PowerPoint 2019, you can create cinematic presentations with new features like Morph and Zoom. And improved inking features across the apps in Windows&#x2014;like the roaming pencil case, pressure sensitivity, and tilt effects&#x2014;allow you to naturally create documents.\r\n\r\nExcel 2019 adds powerful new data analysis features, including new formulas and charts and enhancements to PowerPivot","last_updated":"2018-10-01T12:08:13.877Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c7e0ac15143dc12961bfaf499943ba6f6c0a69c","dn":"Microsoft Office Pro Plus 2019 (x86/x64) Version 1808 (Build 107","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"1c7e0ac15143dc12961bfaf499943ba6f6c0a69c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,126,10,193,81,67,220,18,150,27,250,244,153,148,59,166,246,192,166,156]},"name":"Microsoft Office Pro Plus 2019 (x86/x64) Version 1808 (Build 107","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
