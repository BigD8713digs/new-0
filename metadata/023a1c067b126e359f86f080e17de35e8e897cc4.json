The fourth edition explores the major principles in the field and explains why they are relevant. It is written in a way that clearly shows the patterns in organic chemistry so that readers can gain a deeper conceptual understanding of the material. Topics are presented clearly in an accessible writing style along with numerous hands-on problem solving exercises.\r\nDavid Klein is a Senior Lecturer in the Department of Chemistry at The Johns Hopkins University where he has taught organic chemistry since 1999. Having worked with thousands of students, he has intense first-hand knowledge of how they learn and the difficulties they encounter. He received his bachelor&#x2019;s degree in chemistry from The Johns Hopkins University and his PhD from the University of California at Los Angeles under the supervision of Professor\r\nOrville Chapman. Motivated by his experiences teaching organic chemistry as a graduate student at UCLA","last_updated":"2017-06-09T12:01:16.272Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:023a1c067b126e359f86f080e17de35e8e897cc4","dn":"Organic Chemistry As a Second Language: Second Semesteics, ","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"023a1c067b126e359f86f080e17de35e8e897cc4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,58,28,6,123,18,110,53,159,134,240,128,225,125,227,94,142,137,124,196]},"name":"Organic Chemistry As a Second Language: Second Semesteics, ","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
