Through a recipe-based approach, this book will help you overcome common programming challenges and get your applications ready to face the modern world.\r\n\r\nWe start by running you through new features in C# 7, such as tuples, pattern matching, and so on, giving you hands-on experience with them. Moving forward, you will work with generics and the OOP features in C#. You will then move on to more advanced topics, such as reactive extensions, Regex, code analyzers, and asynchronous programming. This book will also cover new, cross-platform .NET Core 1.1 features and teach you how to utilize .NET Core on macOS. Then, we will explore microservices as well as serverless computing and how these benefit modern developers. Finally, you will learn what you can do with Visual Studio 2017 to put mobile application development across multiple platforms within the reach of any developer","last_updated":"2017-09-20T12:01:35.689Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf6ff99dea2895bbdf24463764011de033a58853","dn":"C# 7 and NET Core Cookbook by Dirk Strauss(2017) - EPUB/PDF - ze","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"bf6ff99dea2895bbdf24463764011de033a58853","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,111,249,157,234,40,149,187,223,36,70,55,100,1,29,224,51,165,136,83]},"name":"C# 7 and NET Core Cookbook by Dirk Strauss(2017) - EPUB/PDF - ze","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
