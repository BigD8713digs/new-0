In a small apartment above Kenmore Square, 16-year-old Daniel Fitzsimmons is listening to his landlord describe a seemingly insane theory about invisible pulses of light and energy that can be harnessed by the human mind. He longs to laugh with his brother Harry about it, but Harry doesn&#x2019;t know he&#x2019;s there - he would never approve of Daniel living on his own. None of that matters, though, because the next night, Harry, a Harvard football star, is murdered in an alley. \r\n\r\nDetectives &#x201C;Bark&#x201D; Jones and Tommy Dillon are assigned to the case. The veteran partners thought they&#x2019;d seen it all, but they are stunned when Daniel wanders into the crime scene. Even stranger, Daniel claims to have known the details of his brother&#x2019;s murder before it ever happened. The subsequent investigation leads the detectives deep into the Fitzsimmons brothers&#x2019; past. They find heartbreaking loss, sordid characters, and metaphysical conspiracies. Even on the rough streets of 1970s Boston, Jones and Dillon have never had a case like this.\r\n\r\nPulse is a novel laced with real danger and otherworldly twists - a master class by an endlessly gifted writer.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-10-26T12:08:59.997Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:e5b8d75b79368a66b25c0b2d0b1ac6184dd7715c","dn":"Pulse by Michael Harvey EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"e5b8d75b79368a66b25c0b2d0b1ac6184dd7715c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,184,215,91,121,54,138,102,178,92,11,45,11,26,198,24,77,215,113,92]},"name":"Pulse by Michael Harvey EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
