She lost 30 pounds, chugged antacid, and visited doctors for three months before she was finally diagnosed with Stage IV colon cancer.\r\n\r\nAs she navigates the aftermath of her diagnosis, Kate pulls the reader deeply into her life, which is populated with a colorful, often hilarious collection of friends, pastors, parents, and doctors, and shares her laser-sharp reflections on faith, friendship, love, and death. She wonders why suffering makes her feel like a loser and explores the burden of positivity. Trying to relish the time she still has with her son and husband, she realizes she must change her habit of skipping to the end and planning the next move. A historian of the &quot;American prosperity gospel&quot; - the creed of the mega-churches that promises believers a cure for tragedy, if they just want it badly enough - Bowler finds that, in the wake of her diagnosis, she craves these same &quot;outrageous certainties&quot;. She wants to know why it&apos;s so hard to surrender control over that which you have no control. She contends with the terrifying fact that, even for her husband and child, she is not the lynchpin of existence, and that even without her, life will go on.\r\n\r\nKate Bowler is warm, witty, and ruthless, and, like Paul Kalanithi, one of the talented, courageous few who can articulate the grief she feels as she contemplates her own mortality.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-02-08T12:07:03.639Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:3eaae4dc365ca2cf6c3ca8f4a6bdf2d1bb273816","dn":"Everything Happens for a Reason by Kate Bowler EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"3eaae4dc365ca2cf6c3ca8f4a6bdf2d1bb273816","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,170,228,220,54,92,162,207,108,60,168,244,166,189,242,209,187,39,56,22]},"name":"Everything Happens for a Reason by Kate Bowler EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
