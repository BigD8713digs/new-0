He has created the equivalent of an interactive tool that allows him to &#x201C;reach&#x201D; across the Internet and give you hands-on instruction to facilitate learning JavaScript. He has accomplished this in three ways. First, he has adopted a relaxed vs. formal language in his text, giving you the impression of learning JavaScript with a friend sitting next to you at the computer, as opposed to being in a formal classroom setting with a teacher. Second, he has broken down the elements of the syllabus into small, easy-to-capture lessons that aid in learning one concept at a time. Third, he has incorporated an interactive quiz / lesson recap tool that reinforces the lesson just completed, thus cementing your learning of the JavaScript language as you progress. Closely coupled with this is the fact that this ebook amounts to a home-study course, allowing you to complete your indoctrination to JavaScript at your leisure and in an environment of your choosing.
