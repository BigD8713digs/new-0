In this highly original and enjoyable new book, Christopher Tyerman focuses on something obvious but overlooked: the massive, all-encompassing and hugely costly business of actually preparing a crusade. The efforts of many thousands of men and women, who left their lands and families in Western Europe, and marched off to a highly uncertain future in the Holy Land and elsewhere have never been sufficiently understood. Their actions raise a host of compelling questions about the nature of medieval society.\r\n\r\nAbout the Author\r\nChristopher Tyerman is Professor of the History of the Crusades at the University of Oxford; Fellow and Tutor in History at Hertford College, Oxford; and Lecturer in Medieval History at New College, Oxford. He has written extensively on the crusades in British publishing, most recently God&apos;s War: A New History of the Crusades and The Debate on the Crusades. He is also the editor of the Penguin Classics edition of the Chronicles of the First Crusade.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\nPreface\r\nChronology\r\nList of Illustrations\r\nList of Maps\r\nIntroduction\r\n1-Images of Reason: \r\n2-Establishing a Case for War: Justification\r\n3-Publicity: Propaganda\r\n4-Persuasion\r\nS-Recruiting and Reward: Recruitment\r\n6-Who Went on Crusade?\r\n7-Costs of a Crusade: Finance\r\n8-Paying for a Crusade\r\n9-Co-ordination: Logistics\r\n10-Health and Safety\r\n11-Supplies\r\n12-Strategy\r\nConclusion\r\nNotes\r\nBibliography\r\nIllustrations\r\nIndex\r\n <a href=\"\nhttps://s1.postimg.org/1gseyzwbv3/How_to_Plan_a_Crusade.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://s1.postimg.org/1gseyzwbv3/How_to_Plan_a_Crusade.jpg</a>","last_updated":"2017-11-06T12:08:31.273Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa7aa9e72c9ff22c2946ba7aceef80f5cafa563c","dn":"How to Plan a Crusade - Religious War in the High Middle Ages","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"fa7aa9e72c9ff22c2946ba7aceef80f5cafa563c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,122,169,231,44,159,242,44,41,70,186,122,206,239,128,245,202,250,86,60]},"name":"How to Plan a Crusade - Religious War in the High Middle Ages","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
