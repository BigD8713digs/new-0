Some of these might be harmful, like the unsolicited installation of malware. When you use Sandboxie to protect your browsing session, it catches all these changes just as the browser is about to apply them into your computer system. Sandboxie does record these changes on behalf of the browser, but it records them in a special isolated folder, called the sandbox.\r\n\r\nThus, with Sandboxie, you can browse the Web securely while still keeping all your browser&apos;s functionality for active and dynamic content, such as javascript and ActiveX.
