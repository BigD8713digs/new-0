The best part - you don&apos;t need to spend time on complex learning. Simply pick the filters and adjust the easy-to-use sliders. Great photography is easy and fun with Luminar. \r\n\r\nFeatures :- \r\n\r\nInnovative Adaptive User Interface \r\nWe all like to mess with photos, but we are all different. Some folks want to get results fast in a single click; others prefer to control every change and dive deep into advance photo editing; and still others want to simply make corrections to get rid of the noise or remove an object and look no further. We&#x2019;ve built the Luminar User Interface to adjust to your skill level and preferences. Make it look exactly the way you want to access only the tools you need. \r\n\r\nFilters, Presets and Workspaces \r\nEverything in Luminar is built for your convenience. Over 35 custom filters help you enhance and change the look of your photos in all possible ways. And the range is impressive: from classic Tone &amp; Exposure, to Bi-Color, Photo Filter Emulation, Cross-Processing and dozens of others. Each filter offers a set of precise &amp; easy to use controls, and includes built-in visual tips to help you out. \r\n\r\nPresets give you the look you want in a single click. Just pick a category and then find the preset that works best for your photo. If you can&#x2019;t find the right preset, create your own to use and even share them with other Luminar users! You&apos;ll be very excited about Workspaces. These are like &#x201C;personalized darkrooms&#x201D; that feature only the tools most suitable for your type of photography; they are saved sets of different filters, logically grouped. \r\n\r\nWorkspaces that come by default include Portrait, Black &amp; White, Landscape and Street. Of course, you can always add new filters to a given Workspace, or even create your personal Workspaces tailored exactly to your needs. Plus, you can even share and import Workspaces by other photographers. \r\n\r\nEasy sky replacement \r\nWe threw this in to get your creative juices flowing. Adding textures and even skies is just one of many cool tricks you&#x2019;ll be able to perform with Luminar. With a ton of tools, layers, blend modes, brushes, masking and more, you get the ultimate freedom to perform complex edits normally done only in Photoshop, with a lot more effort. \r\n\r\nNative RAW processing is only a small part \r\nWe believe that in the modern world the perfect handling of RAW format should not be something extraordinary. It&apos;s a must have for any decent photo software, so with Luminar you can be sure your RAW files will get the necessary pixel perfect treatment. But RAW converter is only a small part of the myriad of the amazing features and tools you&apos;ll get with the new software","last_updated":"2017-12-19T12:02:11.594Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0421c67dcdc40e746f2a1670b6556551884d92e","dn":"Luminar 2018 1.0.2.1064-(x64) Crack","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"d0421c67dcdc40e746f2a1670b6556551884d92e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,66,28,103,220,220,64,231,70,242,161,103,11,101,86,85,24,132,217,46]},"name":"Luminar 2018 1.0.2.1064-(x64) Crack","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
