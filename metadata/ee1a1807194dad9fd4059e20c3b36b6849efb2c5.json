It was supposed to be a holiday for the two sisters. But within a month of arriving at what the locals called Starvation Heights, the women were emaciated shadows of their former selves, waiting for death. They were not the first victims of Linda Hazzard, a quack doctor of extraordinary evil and greed who would stop at nothing short of murder to achieve her ambitions.\r\n\r\nAs their jewelry disappeared and forged bank drafts began transferring their wealth to Hazzards accounts, Dora Williamson sent a last desperate plea to a friend in Australia, begging her to save them from the brutal treatments and lonely isolation of Starvation Heights.\r\n\r\nIn this true story, a haunting saga of medical murder set in an era of steamships and gaslights, Gregg Olsen reveals one of the most unusual and disturbing criminal cases in American history.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-06-05T12:09:44.172Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee1a1807194dad9fd4059e20c3b36b6849efb2c5","dn":"Starvation Heights by Gregg Olsen EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"ee1a1807194dad9fd4059e20c3b36b6849efb2c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,26,24,7,25,77,173,159,212,5,158,32,195,179,107,104,73,239,178,197]},"name":"Starvation Heights by Gregg Olsen EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
