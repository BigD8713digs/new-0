Mishra (CRC, 2014).pdf\r\n\r\nFulfilling the need for a classical approach, Experimental Combustion: An Introduction begins with an overview of the key aspects of combustion&#x2014;including chemical kinetics, premixed flame, diffusion flame, and liquid droplet combustion&#x2014;followed by a discussion of the general elements of measurement systems and data acquisition and analysis. In addition to these aspects, thermal flow measurements, gas composition measurements, and optical combustion diagnostics are covered extensively.\r\n\r\n\r\nBuilding upon this foundation in the fundamentals, the text addresses measurements, instruments, analyses, and diagnostics specific to combustion experiments, as well as:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDescribes the construction, working principles, application areas, and limitations of the necessary instruments for combustion systems\r\n\r\nFamiliarizes the reader with the procedure for uncertainty analysis in combustion experiments\r\n\r\nDiscusses advanced optical techniques, namely particle image velocimetry (PIV), laser Doppler anemometry (LDA), and planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) methods\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom stoichiometry to smoke meters and statistical analysis, Experimental Combustion: An Introduction provides a solid understanding of the underlying concepts and measurement tools required for the execution and interpretation of practical combustion experiments","last_updated":"2017-06-08T12:01:38.078Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c7ec81db3e87c5636a06ef9fcd069af32805257","dn":"Experimental Combustion - An Introduction - D.P.
