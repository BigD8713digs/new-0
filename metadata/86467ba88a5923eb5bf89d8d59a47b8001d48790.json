Scavenge around for items to keep you fed. Build up your base with new modules to replenish your suit power and oxygen.\r\n\r\nBecause MewnBase is in active development, there are definitely bugs, and features are subject to change. Many parts of the design I&apos;m still working on figuring out as I go! I try to post new builds every couple weeks","last_updated":"2017-11-01T12:12:58.434Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:86467ba88a5923eb5bf89d8d59a47b8001d48790","dn":"MewnBase v0.40","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"86467ba88a5923eb5bf89d8d59a47b8001d48790","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,70,123,168,138,89,35,235,91,248,157,141,89,164,123,128,1,212,135,144]},"name":"MewnBase v0.40","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
