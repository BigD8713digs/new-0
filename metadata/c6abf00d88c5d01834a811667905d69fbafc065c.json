In this course, author Rich Stim covers the legal and business issues associated with podcasting. He covers what you can and can&apos;t use in your podcasts&#x2014;to stay on the right side of the law. Rich also explains how to avoid disputes over your podcast, and addresses concerns about running a podcast business: generating an income, branching out when you need to hire help, paying taxes, and protecting your content with trademarks and copyrights.\r\n\r\nDISCLAIMER: This course is taught by an attorney (or other instructor) and addresses US law concepts that may not apply in all countries.
