It was recorded on March 2 and 3, 1973 at the Circle Star Theater in San Carlos, California, and released in October of that year. The album was later included as part of the 1992 Classic Gold collection, and The Little David Years (1971-1977) box set in 1999.\r\n\r\nMuch of Occupation: Foole is devoted to Carlin&apos;s observations about growing up on the Upper West Side of New York City in the 1950s, covering everything from gang culture to school life. The final track, &quot;Filthy Words&quot;, is a continuation and expansion of &quot;Seven Words You Can Never Say on Television&quot; from his previous album, Class Clown.\r\n\r\nDuring the performance of his &quot;Filthy Words&quot; routine Carlin was handed a piece of paper by a stage hand, and after reading the paper announced that he had just won the 1973 Grammy award for Best Comedy Recording for his FM &amp; AM release. The Grammy Awards were being broadcast at the same time he was on stage, and he had not attended because he was contracted to perform the concert which became Occupation Foole on the same night","last_updated":"2017-05-27T08:59:02.006Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:85de6d5e6da914a20800cd9dc9183c9f0e0518bc","dn":"George Carlin - Occupation: Foole - (1973) - (MP3) [=Faith=]","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"85de6d5e6da914a20800cd9dc9183c9f0e0518bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,222,109,94,109,169,20,162,8,0,205,157,201,24,60,159,14,5,24,188]},"name":"George Carlin - Occupation: Foole - (1973) - (MP3) [=Faith=]","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
