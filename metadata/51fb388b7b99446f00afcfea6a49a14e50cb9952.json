Lulu&#x2019;s Proven&#xE7;al Table tantalizes the reader with Olney&#x2019;s descriptions of the regional food served as the vineyard meals at the Domaine. Then he lovingly transcribes Lulu&apos;s recipes. She has an empathy with and understanding of Proven&#xE7;al ingredients that is inspirational. There is succulent Pot-Roasted Leg of Lamb with Black Olives served with Courgette Gratin, and Potato and Sorrel Gratin, delicious with just six ingredients. There are plenty of simple recipes, but the recipe for bouillabaisse is a fascinating 10 pages long.\r\n\r\nHer 150 recipes read like a roll call of the best of Provence &#x336; tapenade, anchoiade, brandade, pissaladi&#xE8;re, bagna cauda, sardines grill&#xE9;es, bouillabaisse, bourride, daurade au fenouil, daube, gigot &#xE0; la ficelle and ratatouille. Starting with aperitifs and amuse-gueule and finishing up with fruit desserts, hers is classic French country cooking, featuring everyday ingredients cooked with respect for their nature and flavor.\r\n\r\nHaving been described as &#x2018;a gastronomic love poem to France&#x2019;s most exhilarating region,&#x2019; this is an essential book for any serious food lover&apos;s library","last_updated":"2018-08-29T12:09:41.539Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:51fb388b7b99446f00afcfea6a49a14e50cb9952","dn":"Richard Olney - Lulu's Provencal table  (epub)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"51fb388b7b99446f00afcfea6a49a14e50cb9952","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,251,56,139,123,153,68,111,0,175,207,234,106,73,161,78,80,203,153,82]},"name":"Richard Olney - Lulu's Provencal table  (epub)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
