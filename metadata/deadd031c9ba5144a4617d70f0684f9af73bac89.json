The group achieved early chart success with the synth-pop singles &quot;Talk Talk&quot; (1982), &quot;It&apos;s My Life&quot; and &quot;Such a Shame&quot; (both 1984) before moving towards more experimental music in the mid-1980s, pioneering what became known as post-rock. Talk Talk achieved widespread critical success, while selling records in Europe and the UK with the singles &quot;Life&apos;s What You Make It&quot; (1985) and &quot;Living in Another World&quot; (1986), and in 1988 they released their fourth album Spirit of Eden, which was critically acclaimed yet commercially less successful.\r\nNatural History: The Very Best of Talk Talk is a 1990 greatest hits album by Talk Talk. It collects songs that the band released under EMI between 1982 and 1988. A companion collection of the band&apos;s music videos was released in July 1990.\r\n\r\nYear of manufacture: 2007\r\nGenre: Pop, Rock, Electronic\r\nDuration: 49 minutes\r\nLabel: EMI \r\nQuality: DVD5\r\nFormat: DVD Video\r\nVideo codec: MPEG2\r\nAudio Codec: PCM\r\nVideo: MPEG 2, 720x576 (PAL 4: 3), 25,000 fps, 9,800 Kbps\r\nAudio: PCM, 48.0 KHz, 2 ch, 1 536 Kbps, CBR\r\n\r\nTracklist:\r\n01.
