But the reality is, profits from stocks come from other investors who are buying and selling stocks, and when companies make money, they keep everything. \r\n\r\nThe belief is, stocks represent value in a company. The truth is, stocks are Ponzi assets because investors&#x2019; profits are dependent on the inflow of money from new investors and no one is obligated to pay the shareholders anything. \r\n\r\nThis is not just another story that will disappear after another bubble bursts. It is an idea that will remain relevant for as long as the stock market exists","last_updated":"2018-08-26T12:05:13.340Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:6df1d062e89b7f79ef15313bf0d4c4c193c8c112","dn":"The Ponzi Factor by Tan Liu (.epub)(.azw3)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"6df1d062e89b7f79ef15313bf0d4c4c193c8c112","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,241,208,98,232,155,127,121,239,21,49,59,240,212,196,193,147,200,193,18]},"name":"The Ponzi Factor by Tan Liu (.epub)(.azw3)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
