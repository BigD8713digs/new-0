This course introduces the main methods for troubleshooting network connectivity issues using different protocols and command-line (CLI) tools. Networking expert Greg Sowell covers HTTP and HTTPS, the protocols that deliver websites; shows how domain names are resolved via DNS; and explains how voice traffic is carried over a network with VoIP. Greg shows how to examine all of these connections and their traffic using CLI tools such as ipconfig, ping, ARP, and Telnet.\r\n\r\nProtocols are the lifeblood of modern communication. By the end of this course, you&apos;ll know what you need to troubleshoot any network connection and keep the communication flowing.\r\n\r\nNote: This course maps to domain 3 of the MTA Networking Fundamentals exam.\r\nTopics include:\r\nThe role of protocols in networking\r\nPort addresses\r\nARP and InARP\r\nDNS and NetBIOS\r\nHTTP and HTTPS\r\nMail protocols\r\nSSH\r\nDHCP\r\nUsing command-line tools to troubleshoot protocols and routing","last_updated":"2017-07-16T12:04:15.503Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:25eed71248e592980b632d2926ad8f94a7cdaffe","dn":"Lynda - Networking Foundations Protocols and CLI Tools","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"25eed71248e592980b632d2926ad8f94a7cdaffe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,238,215,18,72,229,146,152,11,99,45,41,38,173,143,148,167,205,175,254]},"name":"Lynda - Networking Foundations Protocols and CLI Tools","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
