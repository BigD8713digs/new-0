His most ambitious work yet, Hue 1968 is the story of the centerpiece of the Tet Offensive and a turning point in the American War in Vietnam.\r\nBy January 1968, despite an influx of half a million American troops, the fighting in Vietnam seemed to be at a stalemate. Yet General William Westmoreland, commander of American forces, announced a new phase of the war in which &#x201C;the end begins to come into view.&#x201D; The North Vietnamese had different ideas. In mid-1967, the leadership in Hanoi had started planning an offensive intended to win the war in a single stroke. Part military action and part popular uprising, the Tet Offensive included attacks across South Vietnam, but the most dramatic and successful would be the capture of Hue, the country&#x2019;s cultural capital. At 2:30 a.m. on January 31, 10,000 National Liberation Front troops descended from hidden camps and surged across the city of 140,000. By morning, all of Hue was in Front hands save for two small military outposts.\r\n\r\nEnjoy and please SEED!!!","last_updated":"2017-07-16T12:00:57.498Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:31f1d7584e21a350737b52422de9e4f5709b5369","dn":"Hue 1968 - Mark Bowden [EN EPUB] [ebook] [ps]","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"31f1d7584e21a350737b52422de9e4f5709b5369","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,241,215,88,78,33,163,80,115,123,82,66,45,233,228,245,112,155,83,105]},"name":"Hue 1968 - Mark Bowden [EN EPUB] [ebook] [ps]","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
