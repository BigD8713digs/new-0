She endured a life without heat, hot water, adequate food, friendship, or any kind of affectionate treatment.\r\n\r\nBut Maude&apos;s parents could not rule her inner life. Befriending the animals on the lonely estate as well as the characters in the novels she read in secret, young Maude nurtured in herself the compassion and love that her parents forbid as weak. And when, after more than a decade, an outsider managed to penetrate her family&apos;s paranoid world, Maude seized her opportunity. \r\n\r\nBy turns horrifying and magical, The Only Girl in the World is a story that will grip you from the first page and leave you spellbound, a chilling exploration of psychological control that ends with a glorious escape","last_updated":"2017-08-04T12:01:20.112Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:83663ed6af87706e835769261360a0978514aa9a","dn":"The Only Girl in the World ~ Maude Julien [Shades]epub","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"83663ed6af87706e835769261360a0978514aa9a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,102,62,214,175,135,112,110,131,87,105,38,19,96,160,151,133,20,170,154]},"name":"The Only Girl in the World ~ Maude Julien [Shades]epub","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
