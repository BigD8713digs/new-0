His team is gone. Outside, Chicago is dark. Cars lie abandoned. No planes cross the sky. He&#x2019;s relieved to spot other people&#x2014;until he sees they&#x2019;re carrying machetes. \r\nWelcome to the afterlife. \r\nClaire McCoy stands over the body of Will Brody. As head of an FBI task force, she hasn&#x2019;t had a decent night&#x2019;s sleep in weeks. A terrorist has claimed eighteen lives and thrown the nation into panic. \r\nAgainst this horror, something reckless and beautiful happened.
