There is no bigger or more important issue in America than youth violence. Kids, some as young as ten years old, take up arms with the intention to murder. Why is this happening? Lt. Col. Dave Grossman and Gloria DeGaetano believe the root cause is the steady diet of violent entertainment kids see on TV, in movies, and in the video games they play&#x2014;witnessing hundreds of violent images a day. Offering incontrovertible evidence based on recent scientific studies and research, they posit that this media is not just conditioning children to be violent and see killing as acceptable but teaching them the mechanics of killing as well.\r\n\r\nStop Teaching Our Kids to Kill supplies the statistics, interprets the copious research that exists on the subject, and suggests the many ways to make a difference in your home, at school, in your community, in the courts, and in the larger world. In using this book, parents, educators, social-service workers, youth advocates, and anyone interested in the welfare of our children will have a solid foundation for effective action and prevention of future Columbines, Jonesboros, and Newtowns","last_updated":"2018-04-30T12:12:25.098Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:f97173eb78ef3997681077ce33eb17fdea84227e","dn":"Dave Grossman - Stop Teaching Our Kids to Kill: A Call to Action","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"f97173eb78ef3997681077ce33eb17fdea84227e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,113,115,235,120,239,57,151,104,16,119,206,51,235,23,253,234,132,34,126]},"name":"Dave Grossman - Stop Teaching Our Kids to Kill: A Call to Action","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
