It covers all the standard topics in the course, including relativity and introductory quantum mechanics, as well as introductions to statistical physics, nuclear physics high energy physics, astrophysics, and cosmology. &quot;Modern Physics&quot; provides a balanced presentation of both the historical development of all major modern physics concepts and the experimental evidence supporting the theory.\r\n\r\nBRIEF CONTENTS:\r\n---------------\r\n1.
