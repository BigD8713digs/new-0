He has won a Pulitzer Prize, two National Book Awards, two National Book Critics Circle Awards, two PEN/Faulkner Awards, and numerous other distinctions.\r\n\r\nThe hero of Everyman is obsessed with mortality. As he reminds himself at one point, &quot;I&apos;m 34! Worry about oblivion when you&apos;re 75.&quot; But he cannot help himself. He is the ex-husband in three marriages gone wrong. He is the father of two sons who detest him, despite a daughter who adores him. And as his health worsens, he is the envious brother of a much fitter man. A masterful portrait of one man&apos;s inner struggles, Everyman is a brilliant showcase for one of the world&apos;s most distinguished novelists.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-07-08T12:00:20.135Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4ac5c25428b70911778b55dac1e4e18ce591a5e","dn":"Everyman by Philip Roth epub RtR","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"c4ac5c25428b70911778b55dac1e4e18ce591a5e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,172,92,37,66,139,112,145,23,120,181,93,172,30,78,24,206,89,26,94]},"name":"Everyman by Philip Roth epub RtR","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
