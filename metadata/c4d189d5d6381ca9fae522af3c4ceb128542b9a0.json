Why did ancient writers consider the sparrow a lustful creature? Which bird was killed and hung up to predict the weather? And what was an &apos;arse-foot&apos;?\r\nWildlife photographer and history journalist Simon Wills explores the intriguing and at times bizarre stories behind our relationship with birds. Find out why robins feature on Christmas cards, and how Mozart was persuaded to keep a pet starling. What bird did Florence Nightingale carry around in her pocket? How did the blue tit get its name?\r\nWhole careers have been created around birds - from falconers to ostrich farmers - and birds have had great symbolic importance too. Discover, for example, why Raleigh bicycles carry a heron logo and why church lectems are in the shape of an eagle.\r\nIf you enjoy wildlife, then this book is full of surprises. Pigeons were trained to carry messages in wartime, but could gulls be taught to hunt U-boats? And which American president&apos;s parrot started swearing at his funeral?\r\n\r\nAbout the Author\r\nSimon Wills is a history journalist and genealogist who writes regularly for magazines such as _Your Family History_ and _Family Tree_. He has appeared in the TV programme _Who Do You Think You Are?_ and contributes to the magazine and annual live show of the same name. He is also a dedicated wildlife photographer, and all the photographs in this book were taken by him. \r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\nIntroduction\r\nAcknowledgements\r\nBlackbird Blue Tit\r\nChicken Cormorant Crow\r\nDuck Eagle Flamingo\r\nGoldfinch Goose Grebe Gull\r\nHeron Jackdaw Jay\r\nKingfisher Kite Kite\r\nLapwing Ostrich Owl\r\nParrot Peacock\r\nPeregrine Pheasant\r\nPigeon Robin Sparrow\r\nStarling Swan Woodpecker\r\n <a href=\"\nhttps://s9.postimg.org/vti1p618v/A_History_of_Birds.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://s9.postimg.org/vti1p618v/A_History_of_Birds.jpg</a>","last_updated":"2018-01-05T12:01:29.872Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4d189d5d6381ca9fae522af3c4ceb128542b9a0","dn":"A History of Birds (gnv64)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"c4d189d5d6381ca9fae522af3c4ceb128542b9a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,209,137,213,214,56,28,169,250,229,34,175,60,76,235,18,133,66,185,160]},"name":"A History of Birds (gnv64)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
