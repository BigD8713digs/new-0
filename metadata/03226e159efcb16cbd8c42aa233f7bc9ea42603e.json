Philosophical theories and arguments from a comprehensive range of Indian philosophical traditions (including the Nyaya, Mimamsa, Saiva, Vedanta, Samkhya, Jain, Buddhist, materialist and skeptical traditions, as well as some 20th century thought) are covered. The contributors to this volume approach the topics from both a philosophical and a philological perspective. They demonstrate the importance of the subject matter for an understanding of Indian thought in general and they highlight its wider philosophical significance.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\nContributors vii\r\nIntroduction: Indian Epistemology and Metaphysics Joerg Tuske 1\r\nPart I Knowledge, Language, and Logic\r\n1 Epistemology, Metaphysics, and Logic in Pracina Nyaya and Buddhist Philosophy Claus Oetke 13\r\n2 Fallacies and Defeaters in Early Navya Nyaya Stephen H.
