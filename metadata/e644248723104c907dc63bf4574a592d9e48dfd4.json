But his older brother, Blaise, says he believes 60% of Chase&#x2019;s symptoms are exaggerated in order to manipulate their parents. Blaise says their parents take Chase out for nice dinners, get him anything he wants and allow him to lie on the couch all day and complain. Amy and Chris admit they have coddled Chase since he has moved back home. The parents say since their son has moved home, he has terrorized the family, stolen Amy&#x2019;s car and even choked his psychiatrist. Amy says Chase has been hospitalized eight times, and they do not know what is wrong with him. But Chase, who claims his mother kicked him out of the house, says he is suffering from mental problems and does not have behavior issues. Find out what Dr. Phil has to say to this family? \r\n <a href=\"\nhttp://preview.ibb.co/codjS6/screens.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttp://preview.ibb.co/codjS6/screens.jpg</a>","last_updated":"2017-12-20T12:09:12.316Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:e644248723104c907dc63bf4574a592d9e48dfd4","dn":"Dr.Phil.Show.2017.12.19-CBS","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"e644248723104c907dc63bf4574a592d9e48dfd4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,68,36,135,35,16,76,144,125,198,59,244,87,74,89,45,158,72,223,212]},"name":"Dr.Phil.Show.2017.12.19-CBS","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
