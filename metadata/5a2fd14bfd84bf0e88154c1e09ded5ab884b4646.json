He&apos;s become an avid doomsday prepper, raising his diabetic son, Andy, to be ready for any sudden catastrophe.\r\n\r\nAndy, now a student at the prestigious Pepperell Academy, where Jake works as a custodian, has a secret - he&apos;s part of a computer club that redistributes money from the obscenely wealthy to the needy. Usually their targets don&apos;t even realize they&apos;ve been hacked. But this time they&apos;ve stolen from the wrong people: a vicious drug cartel. The cartel infiltrates the academy, taking Andy and his friends hostage one by one. With his training and a stockpile of weapons and supplies, Jake is the last, best hope these students - including his son - have of getting out alive.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-06-03T12:13:38.977Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a2fd14bfd84bf0e88154c1e09ded5ab884b4646","dn":"Constant Fear by Daniel Palmer EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"5a2fd14bfd84bf0e88154c1e09ded5ab884b4646","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,47,209,75,253,132,191,14,136,21,76,30,9,222,213,171,136,75,70,70]},"name":"Constant Fear by Daniel Palmer EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
