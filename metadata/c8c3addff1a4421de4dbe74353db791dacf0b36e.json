Starting with Alexander Graham Bell&#x2019;s revolutionary &quot;harmonic telegraph&quot;, by the middle of the 20th century the phone system had grown into something extraordinary, a web of cutting-edge switching machines and human operators that linked together millions of people like never before. But the network had a billion-dollar flaw, and once people discovered it, things would never be the same.\r\n\r\nExploding the Phone tells this story in full for the first time. It traces the birth of long-distance communication and the telephone, the rise of AT&amp;T&#x2019;s monopoly, the creation of the sophisticated machines that made it all work, and the discovery of Ma Bell&#x2019;s Achilles&#x2019; heel. Phil Lapsley expertly weaves together the clandestine underground of &quot;phone phreaks&quot; who turned the network into their electronic playground, the mobsters who exploited its flaws to avoid the feds, the explosion of telephone hacking in the counterculture, and the war between the phreaks, the phone company, and the FBI.\r\n\r\nThe product of extensive original research, Exploding the Phone is a groundbreaking, captivating book.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-07-01T12:12:05.493Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:c8c3addff1a4421de4dbe74353db791dacf0b36e","dn":"Exploding the Phone by Phil Lapsley EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"c8c3addff1a4421de4dbe74353db791dacf0b36e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,195,173,223,241,164,66,29,228,219,231,67,83,219,121,29,172,240,179,110]},"name":"Exploding the Phone by Phil Lapsley EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
