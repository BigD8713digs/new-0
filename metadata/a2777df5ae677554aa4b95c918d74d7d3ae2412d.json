The first one appeared a century ago, the little square keeping in remarkable shape. Cluetopia is here to toast the centenary, whizzing you through 100 years of remarkable clues, across the world, seeking the inside stories. \r\n\r\nCome travel to New Guinea, Venezuela and Metropolis: every destination arising from a clue. Encounter love, murder, hoaxes, propaganda. Visit a Maori funeral, a Bass Strait oil-rig, a Russian game show-just some of side-trips locked inside a crossword. \r\n\r\nWith almost 100 mini-chapters, each one with a clue to crack, Cluetopia is a book for word lovers and puzzle fans. You&apos;ll see how crosswords capture the life around them, from prison cells to outer space. A holiday for the head, Cluetopia is as fun, as wild and as wordy as David&apos;s previous bestseller, Puzzled.\r\n\r\nGenre: Non-Fiction &gt; General","last_updated":"2018-12-07T12:22:14.000Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2777df5ae677554aa4b95c918d74d7d3ae2412d","dn":"Cluetopia by David Astle (.ePUB)(.AZW3)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"a2777df5ae677554aa4b95c918d74d7d3ae2412d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,119,125,245,174,103,117,84,170,75,149,201,24,215,77,125,58,226,65,45]},"name":"Cluetopia by David Astle (.ePUB)(.AZW3)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
