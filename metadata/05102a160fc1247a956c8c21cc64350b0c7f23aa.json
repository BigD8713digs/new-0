Formed in 1990 by producers Steve Cobby and Dave McSherry, Fila followed Cobby&apos;s association with Ashley &amp; Jackson, a moderately successful pop/dance group signed to Big Life! that went belly up as the label began demanding more and more pop and less dance. Returning to his native Hull from Manchester, Cobby met DJ/dabbler Dave Pork, and the two forged a creative alliance. Hooking up with McSherry to form Fila, the group&apos;s first 12&quot;, &quot;The Mermaid,&quot; was released that same year on Pork&apos;s fledgling imprint (formed, actually, specifically for the occasion), gaining instant acclaim among DJs and headphonauts alike for its innovative fusion of funk, dub, house, hip-hop, and acid jazz.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAudio Quality:\tPerfect (Lossless)\r\nEncoder:\tFLAC\r\nContains: \tAlbum Art, CRC, ID Tag [Vorbis Comments]\r\nGenre: \t\tElectronic\r\nLabel: \t\tTwentythree (T036CD)\r\n\r\n\r\nTracklist:\r\n\r\n01.The Sheriff\r\n02.A Zed And Two L&apos;s\r\n03.Harmonicas Are Shite\r\n04.Soft Music Under Stars\r\n05.Little Dipper\r\n06.Apehorn Concerto\r\n07.The New Cannonball\r\n08.The Speewah\r\n09.Dervish Controller\r\n10.Motown Coppers\r\n11.Thatched Neon\r\n12.You Won&apos;t Let Me Rock\r\n13.The Great Atrractor\r\n14.Nutty Slack\r\n\r\n                     ****You don&apos;t have to thank me...just seed back!****\r\n                                                                    \r\n                                       ****Cheers!****","last_updated":"2018-01-01T12:03:48.630Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:05102a160fc1247a956c8c21cc64350b0c7f23aa","dn":"Fila Brazillia - Retrospective 1990-2006  {FLAC} vtwin88cube","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"05102a160fc1247a956c8c21cc64350b0c7f23aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,16,42,22,15,193,36,122,149,108,140,33,204,100,53,11,12,127,35,170]},"name":"Fila Brazillia - Retrospective 1990-2006  {FLAC} vtwin88cube","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
