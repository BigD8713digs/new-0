The question is: Who will build it first, the United States or China?\r\n\r\nThe latest of David Ignatius&apos; timely, sharp-eyed espionage novels follows CIA agent Harris Chang into a quantum research lab compromised by a suspected Chinese informant. The breach provokes a mole hunt that is obsessive, destructive, and - above all - uncertain: Do the leaks expose real secrets, or are they false trails meant to deceive the Chinese? Chang soon finds that there is a thin line between loyalty and betrayal, as the investigation leads him down a rabbit hole as dangerous as it is deep. Grounded in the real-world global charge toward technological dominance, The Quantum Spy presents a sophisticated game of cat and mouse wired to an exhilarating cyber thriller.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-11-12T12:01:00.331Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:584ef09eb4b1d0ba3331f14b3a39d0faa5ef4c17","dn":"The Quantum Spy by David Ignatius EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"584ef09eb4b1d0ba3331f14b3a39d0faa5ef4c17","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,78,240,158,180,177,208,186,51,49,241,75,58,57,208,250,165,239,76,23]},"name":"The Quantum Spy by David Ignatius EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
