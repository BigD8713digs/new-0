The three musicians who accompanied him in interviews and lip-sync performances were actors, the whole project becoming a concept revolving around media manipulation. The Formula, Thinkman&apos;s first album, sticks close to this idea (the title track begins with the lines &quot;It&apos;s an interview/But it&apos;s a second take&quot;). During the early &apos;80s, Hine followed an evolution that led him from disturbing art pop to intelligent but more commercial songs. The Formula is pretty much middle-of-the-road but has a harder edge than the singer&apos;s previous LP. Songs like the title track &quot;The Ecstasy of Free Thought&quot; and &quot;The Days of a Champion&quot; are fueled by newly found energy and feature the hook-filled melodies that made Hine an important part of England&apos;s &apos;80s pop music. More importantly, there are no weaker tracks, no jumping off the bandwagon for a quick one. As far as concept pop albums go, this one is particularly successful. The Fixx&apos;s James West-Oram provided guitar tracks and Stewart Copeland (ex-The Police) plays some real drums whenever the producer felt the machine was not enough -- they are both featured on the closer &quot;There Shines Our Promised Land.&quot; This album is more than a marketing curiosity, it can be considered as an essential part of Hine&apos;s discography. - Francois Couture, AMG","last_updated":"2017-05-09T19:40:56.432Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9688f307d7586f03a5b128d337f19b14ebf5ab7","dn":"Thinkman 1986 The Formula","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"a9688f307d7586f03a5b128d337f19b14ebf5ab7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,104,143,48,125,117,134,240,58,91,18,141,51,127,25,177,78,191,90,183]},"name":"Thinkman 1986 The Formula","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
