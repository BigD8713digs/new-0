Learning martial arts to potentially defend yourself against attackers is common. Appreciated. Valued. Yet when it comes time to defend mental space, many are defenseless. Those that know how will covertly cross boundaries in broad daylight. If we overtly defend ourselves, we look like the aggressors. Once you learn the techniques of covert verbal self defense, you need never worry about your boundaries again. You&apos;ll learn three levels of deadly tongue-fu: Polite questions that flip the negative energy back on your attackers, sending them fleeing. Short, all-purpose one liners that can be easily memorized and launched with a whisper yet will have devastating effects on your target. Extended stories, to covertly fill their minds with horror and dread at the very thought of you. Use these to rid yourself of stalkers, end relationships cold, and make anybody never, ever want to deal with you again. Discover the art of covert verbal defense and keep your mind free from invaders. Destroy all enemies with mind-obliterating language patterns. Leave those who attempted to take advantage of you wish they&apos;d never met you.\r\n\r\nGenre: Non-Fiction &gt; General","last_updated":"2018-09-15T12:17:59.355Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f177cc0a882e1215fa6ff973c7bb9369f09b9c5","dn":"Weaponized Hypnosis by George Hutton (.epub)(.azw3)(.mobi)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"8f177cc0a882e1215fa6ff973c7bb9369f09b9c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,23,124,192,168,130,225,33,95,166,255,151,60,123,185,54,159,9,185,197]},"name":"Weaponized Hypnosis by George Hutton (.epub)(.azw3)(.mobi)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
