Joe Conason explains how that happened, examining Clinton&apos;s achievements, his failures, and his motivations and why his outlook on the world continues to inspire and infuriate on a grand scale.\r\n\r\nHaving known Clinton for over 20 years, Conason interviewed him many times for this book and gained access to dozens of the former president&apos;s colleagues, friends, aides, supporters, and family members, including Hillary and Chelsea. He has traveled with Clinton to Africa, Haiti, and Israel and across America for the Clinton Foundation.\r\n\r\nClinton has earned millions himself and raised billions for philanthropy, much of it from foreign sources, prompting questions about transparency and probity - even allegations of corruption - as Hillary entered the Democratic presidential primary. Conason examines the substance of those accusations and the financial backing from other countries and wealthy individuals and assesses the real achievements of the foundation.\r\n\r\nAs ever, Clinton&apos;s private life draws conjecture, and he is often in the gossip columns along with fellow celebrities and statesmen. He is friendly with both of the former Presidents Bush. He golfs with President Obama. But how might the first First Gentleman fare in a Hillary Clinton White House?\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-07-28T12:00:28.993Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:d4254c7f13f7ce9e607f46ea6c2f69e4f7bea35c","dn":"Joe Conason - Man of the World 2016 RETAiL ePUB eBOOK-DiSTRiBUTi","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"d4254c7f13f7ce9e607f46ea6c2f69e4f7bea35c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,37,76,127,19,247,206,158,96,127,70,234,108,47,105,228,247,190,163,92]},"name":"Joe Conason - Man of the World 2016 RETAiL ePUB eBOOK-DiSTRiBUTi","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
