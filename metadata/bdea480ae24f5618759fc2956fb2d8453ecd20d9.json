Using computer graphic techniques and full colour animation to bring to life long-extinct lineages, it journeys from the carnivore&apos;s roots at the end of the dinosaur era right up to the present day.\r\n\r\n\r\n1)  The Carnassial Connection \r\nIntroductory programme of a seven part series, exploring the evolution of the carnivores as a successful and highly diverse mammalian group.\r\n\r\n2)  Sharpening the Tooth \r\nExplores the many different members of the cat family and their rise over 40 million years to represent a powerful group of predators within the Carnivora.\r\n\r\n3)  Strength in Numbers \r\nLooks at the evolution of the dog family, how as generalists and through group predation they have filled a successful niche within the Carnivora.\r\n\r\n4)  The Rich Man&apos;s Table \r\nFollows the evolution of the hyaenas within the Carnivora, reveals how they have successfully exploited scavenging strategies, to supplement hunting.\r\n\r\n5)  Jacks of All Trades \r\nThe rise of bears and racoons in the carnivora, exhibit the most diverse feeding patterns of the group, predators-&gt;scavenging omnivores-&gt;specialist herbivores\r\n\r\n6)  Small and Deadly \r\nThe weasel family - fast, ferociously skilful killers. This is the story of how one family of carnivores opted for smallness as a positive advantage.\r\n\r\n7)  It&apos;s Tough at the Top \r\nLooks at the development of top carnivores and asks are they really masters of their world or longterm losers? The winners are the small carnivores.\r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: XviD\r\n * Video Bitrate: 1410-1494 kB/s\r\n * Video Resolution: 640x480\r\n * Audio Codec: MP3\r\n * Audio Bitrate: ~232 kb/s 48.0 kHz\r\n * RunTime Per Part: ~29 min.\r\n * Number Of Parts: 7\r\n * Part Size: 350 MB","last_updated":"2017-12-15T12:07:50.349Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:bdea480ae24f5618759fc2956fb2d8453ecd20d9","dn":"The Velvet Claw 7of7 It's Tough at the Top XviD MP3 ","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"bdea480ae24f5618759fc2956fb2d8453ecd20d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,234,72,10,226,79,86,24,117,159,194,149,111,178,216,69,62,205,32,217]},"name":"The Velvet Claw 7of7 It's Tough at the Top XviD MP3 ","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
