The outburst put the world on the brink of nuclear annihilation. In the end, less than five percent of the reactor&apos;s fuel escaped, but that was enough to contaminate over half of Europe with radioactive fallout. \r\n\r\nIn Chernobyl, Serhii Plokhy recreates these events in all of their drama, telling the stories of the firefighters, scientists, engineers, workers, soldiers, and policemen who found themselves caught in a nuclear Armageddon and succeeded in doing the seemingly impossible: extinguishing the nuclear inferno and putting the reactor to sleep. While it is clear that the immediate cause of the accident was a turbine test gone wrong, Plokhy shows how the deeper roots of Chernobyl lay in the nature of the Soviet political system and the flaws of its nuclear industry. A little more than five years later, the Soviet Union would fall apart, destroyed from within by its unsustainable communist ideology and the dysfunctional managerial and economic systems laid bare in the wake of the disaster","last_updated":"2018-08-25T12:08:14.676Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ed6816f3563dbac21422ae6f55154e0b801a8c9","dn":"Chernobyl: History of a Tragedy by Serhii Plokhy (.epub)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"7ed6816f3563dbac21422ae6f55154e0b801a8c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,214,129,111,53,99,219,172,33,66,42,230,245,81,84,224,184,1,168,201]},"name":"Chernobyl: History of a Tragedy by Serhii Plokhy (.epub)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
