It aired on the FOX Television Network, was hosted by Cat Deeley, and featured returning permanent judges Nigel Lythgoe (one of the show&apos;s executive producers) and Mary Murphy. The show featured many of the format changes instituted in the previous season, including notably a single episode per week/voting round (seasons two through eight featured two episodes per week). It was also the first season to last longer than nine weeks. Lythgoe announced in the finale that the show had been renewed for an eleventh season.\r\n\r\nThe Las Vegas callbacks were held at the Planet Hollywood Resort and Casino in Paradise, Nevada. Contestants had to learn and perform various styles of choreography, with cuts being made after every round. By the end of the week, only 33 dancers remained to be selected for the Top 20.
