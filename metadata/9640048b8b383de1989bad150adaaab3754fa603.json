They owe much to the decades-long march of cultural Marxism through the key pillars of American society: academia, faith communities, government (especially national security), law enforcement, and media. \r\n\r\nAfter all, it was communist, leftist, and progressive operatives who successfully promoted the notion that the Judeo-Christian principles laid down by the Founding Fathers in the USA were, at best, outmoded and, at worst, a force for ill in the world. In this shared antipathy to the traditional religious values that inspired and nurtured Western civilization, Islam and the left found grounds to make common cause: They could set aside their own divergent ideologies and desired end states for the time being and join forces to bring down &apos;The West&apos;.\r\n\r\nPlease seed.
