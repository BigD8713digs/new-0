Through the eyes of Dexter Filkins, the prize-winning New York Times correspondent, we witness the remarkable chain of events that began with the rise of the Taliban in the 1990s, continued with the attacks of 9/11, and moved on to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.\r\n\r\nFilkins&apos; narrative moves across a vast and various landscape of amazing characters and astonishing scenes: a public amputation performed by the Taliban, children frolicking in minefields, skies streaked white by the contrails of B-52s, a night&apos;s sleep in the rubble of Ground Zero.\r\n\r\nWe venture into a torture chamber run by Saddam Hussein. We go into the homes of suicide bombers, meet Iraqi insurgents, and an American captain who loses a quarter of his men in eight days.\r\n\r\nThe Forever War allows us a visceral understanding of today&apos;s battlefields and of the experiences of the people on the ground, warriors and innocents alike. It is a brilliant, fearless work, not just about America&apos;s wars after 9/11, but ultimately about the nature of war itself","last_updated":"2017-06-26T12:02:07.789Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:069b15a82e59b33887d687fa0e90e18e3a91835b","dn":"Dexter Filkins - The Forever War 2008 Retail eBook-BitBook","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"069b15a82e59b33887d687fa0e90e18e3a91835b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,155,21,168,46,89,179,56,135,214,135,250,14,144,225,142,58,145,131,91]},"name":"Dexter Filkins - The Forever War 2008 Retail eBook-BitBook","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
