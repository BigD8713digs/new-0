Arranged much like a travel guide, the book introduces the reader to the general features of the table, the history of the elements, and the underlying arrangement of the table in terms of the structure and properties of atoms.\r\nAtkins sees elements as finely balanced living personalities, with quirks of character and certain, not always outward, dispositions, and the kingdom is thus a land of intellectual satisfaction and infinite delight.\r\n\r\nGenre: Non-Fiction &gt; Educational","last_updated":"2018-09-24T12:33:53.360Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:158fd0bb8ee89e45642db6aa44059c4c6df41476","dn":"The Periodic Kingdom by Peter Atkins (.epub)(.azw3)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"158fd0bb8ee89e45642db6aa44059c4c6df41476","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,143,208,187,142,232,158,69,100,45,182,170,68,5,156,76,109,244,20,118]},"name":"The Periodic Kingdom by Peter Atkins (.epub)(.azw3)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
