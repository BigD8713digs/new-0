Leary\r\nUniv of Iowa | October 1989 | ISBN-10: 0877452423 | scanned PDF | 201 pages | 15.9 mb\r\n\r\nOffers profiles of Americans who influenced the development of aviation and its legal and administrative foundations.\r\nWhat do the inventor of the Model T, two world-renowned art and philanthropy moguls, and a past U.S. president have to do with flying?\r\nHenry Ford, Daniel and Harry Guggenheim, and Herbert Hoover all made pivotal contributions to the burgeoning field of aeronautics during an age when Lindbergh, Earhart, Maitland, and Macready captured the hearts and the spirits of the American people. Few people, then or now, were aware of the impact on aviation made by these and other earthbound individuals. Aviation&apos;s Golden Age examines the feats and accomplishments of these forgotten men. Eight of the nation&apos;s leading experts in aviation history have contributed these fascinating portraits. Also included are over twenty historical photographs that capture the excitement of the era.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\nIntrod uction : ix\r\nHenry Ford and Aeronautics during the 1920s : 1\r\nWilliam M.
