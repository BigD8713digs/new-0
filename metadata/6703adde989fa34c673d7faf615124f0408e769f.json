Taylor also claims that her mom is a recovering alcoholic who ruined her childhood and is to blame for her having no life skills. Michelle says she looks good for her age and is proud of it. She says her daughter is a spoiled brat and that she gave her the tools she needs to be independent, but Taylor refuses to use them. Can Dr. Phil help save this mother-daughter relationship?","last_updated":"2017-11-24T12:04:05.336Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:6703adde989fa34c673d7faf615124f0408e769f","dn":"Dr.Phil.Show.2017.09.07-CBS","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"6703adde989fa34c673d7faf615124f0408e769f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,3,173,222,152,159,163,76,103,61,127,175,97,81,36,240,64,142,118,159]},"name":"Dr.Phil.Show.2017.09.07-CBS","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
