Intellectually and emotionally, Beethoven&apos;s Third Symphony, the &quot;Eroica,&quot; rudely broke the mold of the Viennese Classical symphony and revealed a powerful new expressiveness, both personal and societal. Even the whiff of actual political revolution was woven into the work-it was originally inscribed to Napoleon Bonaparte, a dangerous hero for a composer dependent on conservative royal patronage. With the first two stunning chords of the &quot;Eroica,&quot; classical music was transformed.\r\n\r\nIn Beethoven&apos;s Eroica, James Hamilton-Paterson reconstructs this great moment in Western culture, the shock of the music and the symphony&apos;s long afterlife.\r\n\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-12-18T12:01:37.440Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:233d4d7b9d69369315f6676c7a89589dade43559","dn":"Beethoven's Eroica_ The First Great Romantic Symphony EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"233d4d7b9d69369315f6676c7a89589dade43559","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,61,77,123,157,105,54,147,21,246,103,108,122,137,88,157,173,228,53,89]},"name":"Beethoven's Eroica_ The First Great Romantic Symphony EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
