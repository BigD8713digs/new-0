It has been recorded hundreds of times and contains a tune that is as instantly recognisable as any in music. Yet few people know the extraordinary story of how this much-loved piece came to public attention - or how it helped save the lives of tens of thousands of children.\r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n\r\n * Video Container: mkv\r\n * Video Bitrate: 3357 kb/s\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\n * Video Resolution: 1920x1080\r\n * Frame Rate: 25 FPS\r\n * Audio Codec: AC-3\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 192 kb/s\r\n * Audio Channels: 2\r\n * Run-Time: ~59 mins\r\n * Number of Parts: 1\r\n * Part Size: 1.47 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV","last_updated":"2017-12-16T12:00:57.590Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:56915e583a68292d21c57f324c0f1ae3853d45aa","dn":"BBC Messiah at the Foundling Hospital 1080i HDTV docuindex","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"56915e583a68292d21c57f324c0f1ae3853d45aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,145,94,88,58,104,41,45,33,197,127,50,76,15,26,227,133,61,69,170]},"name":"BBC Messiah at the Foundling Hospital 1080i HDTV docuindex","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
