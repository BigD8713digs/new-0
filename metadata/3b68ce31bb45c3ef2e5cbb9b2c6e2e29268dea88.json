A three-time Grammy Award&#x2013;winner known for his distinctive bass-baritone voice and romantic image, White&apos;s greatest success came in the 1970s as a solo singer and with The Love Unlimited Orchestra, crafting many enduring soul, funk, and disco songs such as his two biggest hits, &quot;You&apos;re the First, the Last, My Everything&quot; and &quot;Can&apos;t Get Enough of Your Love, Babe&quot;.\r\nUnlimited presents tracks from when he stepped out with his own sound, with Love Unlimited in 1972, through his final studio album, the Grammy-winning Staying Power, released in 1999. The DVD offers every video from his tenure on A&amp;M Records and rare bonus clips, including a live duet with Luciano Pavarotti that has become a YouTube phenomenon; each clip has bonus commentary from Jack Perry, White&apos;s longtime friend, co-producer and musical director.\r\n\r\nGenre: Soul\r\nDuration: 1:00:50\r\nYear of manufacture: Octobe 2009\r\nLabel: Universal\r\nBreakdown into chapters by tracks: yes\r\nQuality: DVD9\r\nFormat: DVD video\r\nVideo codec: MPEG2\r\nAudio Codec: DTS; PCM; AC-3\r\nVideo: NTSC 4: 3 (720x480) VBR; 29.970 fps; bitrate: 5776 Kbps; nominal bitrate: 5000 kbps\r\nAudio 1: LinearPCM, 2 ch - 1536 Kbps;\r\nAudio 2: DTS, 6 ch - 1510 Kbps;\r\nAudio 3: Dolby AC3, 6 ch - 448 Kbps;\r\nAudio 4: Dolby AC3, 2 ch - 192 Kbps.\r\n\r\nTracklist:\r\n01.
