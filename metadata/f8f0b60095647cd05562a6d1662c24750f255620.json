The townsfolk assume Hartley had something to do with the escape, so they relieve him of his duties. In his place, the citizens install Mark Collins (Roger Williams) as sheriff. Unfortunately, Collins is a gambler and--secretly--the outlaw chief responsible for the stagecoach robbery. Eventually Hartley returns to the town, exposes the crook, clears his son&apos;s name, and reassumes his job as sheriff. And Collins? He shoots himself rather than face a lynch mob.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScreenshots:\r\n\r\n <a href=\"\nhttps://i.imgur.com/bQuP7XH.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://i.imgur.com/bQuP7XH.jpg</a>\r\n <a href=\"\nhttps://i.imgur.com/4OCQccg.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://i.imgur.com/4OCQccg.jpg</a>\r\n <a href=\"\nhttps://i.imgur.com/gG0rN4Z.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://i.imgur.com/gG0rN4Z.jpg</a>\r\n <a href=\"\nhttps://i.imgur.com/ZnBEIGk.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://i.imgur.com/ZnBEIGk.jpg</a>\r\n <a href=\"\nhttps://i.imgur.com/JO1ZZMA.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://i.imgur.com/JO1ZZMA.jpg</a>\r\n <a href=\"\nhttps://i.imgur.com/bxENKlE.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://i.imgur.com/bxENKlE.jpg</a>","last_updated":"2018-05-12T12:12:58.466Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:f8f0b60095647cd05562a6d1662c24750f255620","dn":"Wagon Trail  (Western 1935)  Harry Carey  720p","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"f8f0b60095647cd05562a6d1662c24750f255620","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,240,182,0,149,100,124,208,85,98,166,209,102,44,36,117,15,37,86,32]},"name":"Wagon Trail  (Western 1935)  Harry Carey  720p","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
