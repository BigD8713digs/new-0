Each one of these systems has had a vast and varied development. Attempt has been made to introduce the listener to the spirit and outlook of Indian philosophy and help him to grasp thoroughly the central ideas rather than acquaint him with minute details. Modern students of philosophy feel many difficulties in understanding the Indian problems and theories. Their long experience with university students has helped the authors to realise these, and they have tried to remove them as far as possible. This accounts for most of the critical discussions which could otherwise have been dispensed with.\r\n\r\nNarrated by: Anindyo Chakrabarti\r\nLength: 14 hrs and 31 mins\r\nUnabridged Audiobook\r\nRelease date: 30-05-2018\r\nLanguage: English\r\nPublisher: Audible Studios\r\n <a href=\"\nhttps://www.audible.com.au/pd/Non-fiction/An-Introduction-to-Indian-Philosophy-Audiobook/B07DCVZFX4\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://www.audible.com.au/pd/Non-fiction/An-Introduction-to-Indian-Philosophy-Audiobook/B07DCVZFX4</a>","last_updated":"2018-07-04T12:01:31.789Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:94b7e3b86189d53c4ba2b51562a382994e2c28cd","dn":"An Introduction to Indian Philosophy 2018","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"94b7e3b86189d53c4ba2b51562a382994e2c28cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,183,227,184,97,137,213,60,75,162,181,21,98,163,130,153,78,44,40,205]},"name":"An Introduction to Indian Philosophy 2018","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
