But the power of such systems goes beyond simple algebraic or numerical manipulation. This book shows how computer-aided mathematics has reached a level where it can support effectively many of the computations in science and engineering. In addition to treating traditional computer science topics, an introductory course should show scientists and engineers how these computer-based tools can be used to do scientific computations. A valuable text for computer science courses for scientists and engineers, this book should also prove useful to Mathematica users at all levels. Covering the latest release of Mathematica, the book includes useful tips and techniques to help even seasoned users","last_updated":"2017-11-30T12:03:57.759Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:7cf3cdeb07a32be75c24448ed7b5feba678e974a","dn":"Computer Science with MATHEMATICA (mrkiven0).pdf","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"7cf3cdeb07a32be75c24448ed7b5feba678e974a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,243,205,235,7,163,43,231,92,36,68,142,215,181,254,186,103,142,151,74]},"name":"Computer Science with MATHEMATICA (mrkiven0).pdf","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
