But Mike and Matt said their parents were the ones who needed Dr. Phil&#x2019;s help. So, what happened to this broken family after the show? And what happened to Lisa, who appeared on the show because her daughter, Misti, said she was a &#x201C;raging alcoholic.&#x201D; Has Lisa been able to maintain her sobriety? Find out how these past guests and their families are doing today. Plus, Mel is a former guest who was not only having relationship issues, but she was also struggling with her weight. After discussing Dr. Phil&#x2019;s The 20/20 Diet, Mel took Dr. Phil&#x2019;s advice about her health to heart. The results of her hard work this past year are absolutely shocking &#x2013; you will not recognize the new Mel!","last_updated":"2018-01-26T12:11:15.827Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:71894e82e9e14e368fbe4ddd6fe273a3586f1860","dn":"Dr.Phil.Show.2018.01.23-CBS","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"71894e82e9e14e368fbe4ddd6fe273a3586f1860","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,137,78,130,233,225,78,54,143,190,77,221,111,226,115,163,88,111,24,96]},"name":"Dr.Phil.Show.2018.01.23-CBS","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
