Do not believe the hype.\r\n\r\nAlan Roger Currie, author of &quot;Mode One: Let the Women Know What You&apos;re REALLY Thinking,&quot; releases yet another book full of his own brand of unique knowledge and wisdom as he once again discusses women who are &quot;Reciprocators,&quot; &quot;Rejecters,&quot; &quot;Pretenders,&quot; and &quot;Timewasters.&quot;\r\n\r\nCurrie&apos;s main emphasis in his new book is that many women know how to motivate naive men and men with strong sexual urges to provide them with flattery, entertaining conversations, financial and non-financial favors, or simply an empathetic listening ear. The women&apos;s #1 tool of manipulation is to offer men &quot;the possibility of sex&quot; in the near or distant future.\r\n\r\nIf you are a man who is left feeling agitated, angry, frustrated, or bitter after engaging in a series of conversations and interactions with a woman of interest, you will have your entire mindset and paradigm changed as a result of reading this book and adhering to Currie&apos;s teachings","last_updated":"2018-01-28T12:10:24.265Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd4a0ffba7993fbb24f857181226cf746c4753ec","dn":"The Possibility of Sex - How Naive and Lustful are Manipulat","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"bd4a0ffba7993fbb24f857181226cf746c4753ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,74,15,251,167,153,63,187,36,248,87,24,18,38,207,116,108,71,83,236]},"name":"The Possibility of Sex - How Naive and Lustful are Manipulat","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
