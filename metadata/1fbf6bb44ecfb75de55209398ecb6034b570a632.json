Syria has been ruled by a strong, strict and often merciless regime, handed down from father to son since 1970.\r\n\r\n&quot;We, the old guard, couldn&apos;t believe it. Protests like that? In the state of Hafez al-Assad? In Syria? For the old guard, it was impossible. Forty-five years of rule had brainwashed us. When the revolution began, our orders were to shoot,&quot; says Munir al-Hariri, a former member of the Syrian intelligence service.\r\n\r\nTechnical Spec\r\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC <a class=\"__cf_email__\" href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection\" data-cfemail=\"f2ba9b959ab2bec1dcc3\">[email&#xA0;protected]</a><script data-cfhash=\"f9e31\" type=\"text/javascript\">/* <![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName('script'),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute('data-cfhash'))return t[e]}();if(t&&(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute('data-cfemail')){for(e='',r='0x'+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+='%'+('0'+('0x'+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]> */</script>\r\nVideo Bitrate: CRF 20 (~2047Kbps)\r\nVideo Resolution: 1280x664\r\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.93:1\r\nFrames Rate: 25 FP\r\nAudio Codec: HE-AAC\r\nAudio Bitrate: 64Kbps CBR 24KHz\r\nAudio Channels: 2\r\nRun-Time: 46 mins\r\nNumber Of Parts: 1\r\nPart Size: 697 MB\r\nSource: HDTV\r\nSubtitles: Embedded English","last_updated":"2017-05-24T11:44:26.429Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:1fbf6bb44ecfb75de55209398ecb6034b570a632","dn":"Al-Jazeera The Disappeared of Syria 720p HDTV x264-MVGroup","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"1fbf6bb44ecfb75de55209398ecb6034b570a632","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,191,107,180,78,207,183,93,229,82,9,57,142,203,96,52,181,112,166,50]},"name":"Al-Jazeera The Disappeared of Syria 720p HDTV x264-MVGroup","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
