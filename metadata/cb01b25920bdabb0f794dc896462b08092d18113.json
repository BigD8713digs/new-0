It was Down&apos;s first album in seven years since the release of NOLA, the longest gap between the band&apos;s three studio albums to date.

They also scheduled an 18-date tour that began May 1 in New York and ended on May 25 in Dallas.\r\n\r\nOn May 11th they were in Chicago at The House of Blues...\r\n\r\nTracklist\r\n\r\nDisk 1 \r\n\r\n01 - The Seed.mp3\r\n02 - Theres Something On My Side.mp3\r\n03 - Temptations Wings.mp3\r\n04 - Lifer.mp3\r\n05 - Lysergik Funeral Procession.mp3\r\n06 - Rehab.mp3\r\n07 - Ghosts Along The Mississippi.mp3\r\n08 - Learn From This Mistake.mp3\r\n09 - Beautifully Depressed.mp3\r\n10 - Lies, I Dont Know What They Say.mp3\r\n\r\nDisk 2\r\n\r\n11 - New Orleans Is A Dying Whore.mp3\r\n12 - Stone The Crow.mp3\r\n13 - Eyes Of The South.mp3\r\n14 - Bury Me In Smoke.mp3\r\n15 - Albatross(Bonus).mp3\r\n16 - Congratulations Song(Bonus).mp3\r\n17 -13 Angels - 7 Days.mp3\r\n18 - Vote With A Bullet(Bonus).mp3\r\n19 - Wiseblood(Bonus).mp3\r\n\r\nBonus Tracks From Pepper Keenans Old Band Corrosion of Conformity\r\nWhere He was Lead Guitar and Vocals (In case anybody forgot Pepper Can Sing)\r\n\r\n\r\nPlayers\r\n\r\nDown\r\n\r\n    Philip Anselmo &#x2013; vocals, guitar on &quot;Landing on the Mountains of Meggido&quot;\r\n    Pepper Keenan &#x2013; guitar\r\n    Kirk Windstein &#x2013; guitar\r\n    Rex Brown &#x2013; bass\r\n    Jimmy Bower &#x2013; drums, all instruments on &quot;Doobinterlude&quot;","last_updated":"2017-09-06T12:03:22.059Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb01b25920bdabb0f794dc896462b08092d18113","dn":"Down - Live The House Of Blues, Chicago(Deluxe 2-CD)2002 ak320","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"cb01b25920bdabb0f794dc896462b08092d18113","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,1,178,89,32,189,171,176,247,148,220,137,100,98,176,128,146,209,129,19]},"name":"Down - Live The House Of Blues, Chicago(Deluxe 2-CD)2002 ak320","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
