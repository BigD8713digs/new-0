Famously home to artists and activists, and known as the birthplace of the Beats, the Black Panthers, and the LGBTQ movement, the Bay Area has been transformed by Silicon Valley. But the richer the region gets, the more unequal and less diverse it becomes, and the cracks in the city&apos;s facade begin to show. \r\n\r\nInspired by Studs Terkel&apos;s classic works of oral history, writer and filmmaker Cary McClelland has spent several years interviewing people at the epicenter of the Bay Area&apos;s rapid change: tech innovators, venture capitalists, coders, homeless advocates, pawn brokers, prosecutors and public defenders, tattoo artists, and tour guides. Silicon City masterfully weaves together their voices and unforgettable stories to create a dynamic portrait of a beloved city and a cautionary tale for the entire country.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-10-22T12:04:07.759Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:d4963c7e26a92c90efe5c5adce54d60f83a890a5","dn":"Silicon City by Cary McClelland EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"d4963c7e26a92c90efe5c5adce54d60f83a890a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,150,60,126,38,169,44,144,239,229,197,173,206,84,214,15,131,168,144,165]},"name":"Silicon City by Cary McClelland EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
