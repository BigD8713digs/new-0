She writes of hotels that offer &quot;guerrilla discounts,&quot; gun shops that advertise Father&apos;s Day deals, and a real-estate market where &quot;Unusual Security and Ready Access to the Ocean&quot; are perks for wealthy homeowners looking to make a quick escape. With a booming drug trade, staggering racial and class inequities, and skyrocketing murder rates, Miami in the 1980s felt more like a Third World capital than a modern American city. Didion describes the violence, passion, and paranoia of these troubled times in arresting detail and &quot;beautifully evocative prose&quot; (The New York Times Book Review).\r\n\r\nA vital report on an immigrant community traumatized by broken dreams and the cynicism of US foreign policy, Miami is a masterwork of literary journalism whose insights are timelier and more important than ever","last_updated":"2017-12-10T12:07:52.188Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:d8d2818e1fe9c28f4da6ebdda8aeb64968ce57f1","dn":"Miami By Joan Didion(2017) - EPUB - zeke23 ","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"d8d2818e1fe9c28f4da6ebdda8aeb64968ce57f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,210,129,142,31,233,194,143,77,166,235,221,168,174,182,73,104,206,87,241]},"name":"Miami By Joan Didion(2017) - EPUB - zeke23 ","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
