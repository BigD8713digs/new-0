We obsess over our emails, Instagram likes, andfeeds; we binge on TV episodes and YouTube videos; we work longer hours each year; and we spend an average of three hours each day using our smartphones. Half of us would rather suffer a broken bone than a broken phone, and millennial kids spend so much time in front of screens that they struggle to interact with real, live humans.\r\n\r\nIn this revolutionary book, Adam Alter, a professor of psychology and marketing at NYU, tracks the rise of behavioral addiction and explains why so many of today&apos;s products are irresistible. Though these miraculous products melt the miles that separate people across the globe, their extraordinary and sometimes damaging magnetism is no accident. The companies that design these products tweak them over time until they become almost impossible to resist.\r\n\r\nBy reverse engineering behavioral addiction, Alter explains how we can harness addictive products for the good - to improve how we communicate with each other, spend and save our money, and set boundaries between work and play - and how we can mitigate their most damaging effects on our well-being and the health and happiness of our children.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-07-11T12:00:20.871Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:0559b7b95ea80ef12157036adb97d289df942e59","dn":"Adam Alter - Irresistible_The Rise of Addictive Technology 2017 ","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"0559b7b95ea80ef12157036adb97d289df942e59","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,89,183,185,94,168,14,241,33,87,3,106,219,151,210,137,223,148,46,89]},"name":"Adam Alter - Irresistible_The Rise of Addictive Technology 2017 ","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
