Drawing on interviews with astronauts, cosmonauts, their families, technicians, and scientists, as well as rarely seen Soviet and American government documents, the authors craft a remarkable story of the golden age of spaceflight as both an intimate human experience and a rollicking global adventure. From the Gemini flights to the Soyuz space program to the earliest Apollo missions, including the legendary first moon landing, their book draws a richly detailed picture of the space race as an endeavor equally endowed with personal meaning and political significance.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-01-27T12:03:43.596Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:20df94950a9ad2c094470c1c4cc91bed0920adbe","dn":"In the Shadow of the Moon by Francis French, Colin Burgess MOBI","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"20df94950a9ad2c094470c1c4cc91bed0920adbe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,223,148,149,10,154,210,192,148,71,12,28,76,201,27,237,9,32,173,190]},"name":"In the Shadow of the Moon by Francis French, Colin Burgess MOBI","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
