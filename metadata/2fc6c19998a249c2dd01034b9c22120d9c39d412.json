But Josh Shipp didn&apos;t need Harvard to know that. Once an at-risk foster kid, he was headed straight for trouble until he met the man who changed his life: Rodney, the foster parent who refused to quit on Shipp and got him to believe in himself.\r\n\r\nNow, in The Grown-Up&apos;s Guide to Teenage Humans, Shipp shows all of us how to be that caring adult in a teenager&apos;s life. Stressing the need for compassion, trust, and encouragement, he breaks down the phases of a teenage human from sixth to 12th grade, examining the changes, goals, and mentality of teenagers at each stage.\r\n\r\nShipp offers revelatory stories that take us inside the teen brain and shares wisdom from top professionals and the most expert grown-ups. He also includes practice scripts that address tough issues, including:\r\n\r\nForgiveness: What do I do when a teen has been really hurt by someone and it&apos;s not their fault?\r\nCommunication: How do I get a teen to talk to me? They just grunt.\r\nTrust: My teen blew it. My trust is gone. Where do we go from here?\r\nBullying: Help! A teen (or their friend) is being harassed.\r\nDifficult and awkward conversations: Drugs. Death. Sex. Oh my.\r\n\r\nWritten in Shipp&apos;s playfully authoritative, no-nonsense voice, The Grown-Up&apos;s Guide to Teenage Humans tells his story and unpacks practical strategies that can make a difference. Ultimately, it&apos;s not about shortcuts or magic words - as Shipp reminds us, it&apos;s about investing in kids and giving them the love, time, and support they need to thrive.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-11-03T12:08:42.175Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:2fc6c19998a249c2dd01034b9c22120d9c39d412","dn":"The Grown-Up's Guide to Teenage Humans by Josh Shipp EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"2fc6c19998a249c2dd01034b9c22120d9c39d412","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,198,193,153,152,162,73,194,221,1,3,75,156,34,18,13,156,57,212,18]},"name":"The Grown-Up's Guide to Teenage Humans by Josh Shipp EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
