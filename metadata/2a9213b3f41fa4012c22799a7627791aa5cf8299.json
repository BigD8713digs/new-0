Underwater on mortgages or finding that Social Security comes up short, they&apos;re hitting the road in astonishing numbers, forming a new community of nomads: RV and van-dwelling migrant laborers, or &quot;workampers&quot;.\r\n\r\nBuilding on her groundbreaking Harper&apos;s cover story, &quot;The End of Retirement&quot;, which brought attention to these formerly settled members of the middle class, Jessica Bruder follows one such RVer, Linda, between physically taxing seasonal jobs and reunions of her new van-dweller family, or &quot;vanily&quot;. Bruder tells a compelling, eye-opening tale of both the economy&apos;s dark underbelly and the extraordinary resilience, creativity, and hope of these hardworking, quintessential Americans - many of them single women - who have traded rootedness for the dream of a better life.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-09-28T12:03:02.923Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a9213b3f41fa4012c22799a7627791aa5cf8299","dn":"Nomadland_ Surviving America in the Twenty-First Century by Jess","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"2a9213b3f41fa4012c22799a7627791aa5cf8299","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,146,19,179,244,31,164,1,44,34,121,154,118,39,121,26,165,207,130,153]},"name":"Nomadland_ Surviving America in the Twenty-First Century by Jess","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
