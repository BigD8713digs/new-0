Ostrom, Cheryl A. Wilhelmsen\r\nEdition: 1 edition\r\nPublication Date: May 2, 2016\r\nPublisher: Wiley\r\nISBN-10: 1118814215\r\nISBN-13: 978-1118814215\r\nPages: 552 pages\r\nFormat: pdf\r\nSize: 19M\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe approach to the book is analogous to a toolkit.  The user will open the book and locate the tool that best fits the ergonomic assessment task he/she is performing. The chapters of the book progress from the concept of ergonomics, through the various assessment techniques, and into the more complex techniques.  In addition to discussing the techniques, this book presents them in a form that the readers can readily adapt to their particular situation.  Each chapter, where applicable, presents the technique discussed in that chapter and demonstrates how it is used.  The supporting material at the end of each chapter contains exercises, case studies and review questions.  The case study section of the book presents how to use techniques to analyze a range of workplace scenarios.\r\n\r\n---\r\n <a href=\"\nhttp://dlfeb.com/book/occupational-ergonomics-practical-approach/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttp://dlfeb.com/book/occupational-ergonomics-practical-approach/</a>","last_updated":"2017-06-16T12:00:55.756Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:a68ca35a94d119f7223c1cfd6e308fdea0791657","dn":"OCCUPATIONAL ERGONOMICS: A PRACTICAL APPROACH","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"a68ca35a94d119f7223c1cfd6e308fdea0791657","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,140,163,90,148,209,25,247,34,60,28,253,110,48,143,222,160,121,22,87]},"name":"OCCUPATIONAL ERGONOMICS: A PRACTICAL APPROACH","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
