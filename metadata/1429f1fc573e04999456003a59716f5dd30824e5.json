And it&apos;s the responsibility of network professionals to get routing right. So join Lazaro Diaz, as he takes you through advanced topics and techniques in Cisco routing, from configuring RIPv2 routes for smaller networks, to EIGRP, advanced distance routing, and OSPF, a more complex protocol that brings many more features and greater flexibility to your network. You&apos;ll be able to practice configuring all of these protocols using the Packet Tracer demo environment and Lazaro&apos;s detailed tutorials.\r\nTopics include:\r\nConfiguring static and default routes\r\nUnderstanding dynamic routing\r\nIssuing verification commands\r\nComparing RIPng and RIPv2\r\nUsing RIP timers\r\nConfiguring an EIGRP feasible successor route\r\nExploring EIGRP options\r\nIntroducing the OSPF process ID\r\nExploring wildcard masking","last_updated":"2017-07-16T12:04:18.356Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:1429f1fc573e04999456003a59716f5dd30824e5","dn":"Lynda - Advanced Cisco Routing RIPv2, EIGRP, and OSPF","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"1429f1fc573e04999456003a59716f5dd30824e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,41,241,252,87,62,4,153,148,86,0,58,89,113,111,93,211,8,36,229]},"name":"Lynda - Advanced Cisco Routing RIPv2, EIGRP, and OSPF","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
