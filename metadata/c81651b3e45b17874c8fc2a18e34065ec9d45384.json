While he also continues to abandon a practice of recording with a live band -- one that may have ended with Aureate Gloom -- he is joined on the album by some key long-distance contributors. Zac Colwell (woodwinds, synths, percussion) is a former collaborator whose judiciously placed saxophone reinforces the &apos;80s effect here, and touring bandmembers JoJo Glidewell (synths, keys) and Clayton Rychlik (drums) have been part of Of Montreal&apos;s recording core for much of the 2010s. Still, as Barnes is often wont to do, White Is Relic/Irrealis Mood doesn&apos;t sound quite like anything they&apos;ve done prior, once one looks beyond its distinctively serpentine quality and Barnes&apos; calling-card loquaciousness. With reference to the latter, the album presents six over-five-minute-long dance-funk tracks with titles like &quot;Paranoiac Intervals/Body Dysmorphia&quot; and &quot;Plateau Phase/No Careerism No Corruption.&quot; Lyrics grapple with sociopolitical and societal topics like intersectionality, gentrification, and online-only encounters -- to name a few from the slinky opening track alone -- as well as sex, drugs, and music. On &quot;Plateau,&quot; he makes hip-grinding choruses out of neurotic lines like &quot;If we put our ear to the ceiling/We can hear the multiverse seeding/We can hear the simulation wheezing....&quot; Accompanying arrangements are generally dense but melodic, often capturing a certain basement-club je ne sais quoi. Taken together, White Is Relic/Irrealis Mood offers convoluted yet catchy dance-rock that lures with flamboyant basslines while reflecting a dancing-while-anxious Zeitgeist","last_updated":"2018-03-11T12:16:32.406Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:c81651b3e45b17874c8fc2a18e34065ec9d45384","dn":"of Montreal - White Is Relic Irraelis Mood (2018) [16.44 FLAC]","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"c81651b3e45b17874c8fc2a18e34065ec9d45384","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,22,81,179,228,91,23,135,76,143,194,161,142,52,6,94,201,212,83,132]},"name":"of Montreal - White Is Relic Irraelis Mood (2018) [16.44 FLAC]","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
