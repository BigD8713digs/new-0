A gorgeous brownstone on a tree-lined street in Boston&#x2019;s Back Bay neighborhood. A great marriage, admired by all. A perfect life.\r\nThis is what I know: Pain has a flavor....\r\nWhen investigator Tessa Leone arrives at the crime scene in the foyer of the Denbes&#x2019; home, she finds scuff marks on the floor and a million tiny pieces of bright green Taser confetti. The family appears to have been abducted, with only a pile of their cell phones and electronic devices remaining. No witnesses, no ransom demands, no motive. Just a perfect little family, gone.\r\nThis is what I fear: The worst is yet to come....\r\nTessa knows better than anyone that flawless fronts can hide the darkest secrets. Now she must race against the clock to uncover the Denbes&#x2019; innermost dealings, a complex tangle of friendships and betrayal, big business and small sacrifices.
