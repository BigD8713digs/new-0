Bench McCarthy is a thug&apos;s thug, a hitman, an underworld jack-of-all-trades running his own mob out of Winter Hill in Somerville while simultaneously handling &quot;wet work&quot; for Sally Curto, a half-demented, totally obscene mob boss. After years of gangland peace, Bench and Sally suddenly find themselves clay pigeons for unknown hit crews coming at them from every direction.\r\n\r\nThe motives are as murky as the hitmen themselves, but all roads seem to lead back to the State House, where corrupt pols are battling over a bill to legalize billions of dollars&apos; worth of new casinos. In order to stay alive as he puts an end to the uprising, the wisecracking Bench must set aside his objections and enlist the help of Jack Reilly, a dodgy ex-cop turned private investigator. The hunter has become the hunted.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-01-28T12:03:47.424Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:37eca0f4b5f7f8b082a3d4ed55a50bd2c4857863","dn":"Killers by Howie Carr EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"37eca0f4b5f7f8b082a3d4ed55a50bd2c4857863","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,236,160,244,181,247,248,176,130,163,212,237,85,165,11,210,196,133,120,99]},"name":"Killers by Howie Carr EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
