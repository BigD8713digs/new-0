Kidder EPUB\r\n\r\nMillions of Americans keep bedside books of prayer and meditative reflection collections of daily passages to stimulate spiritual thought and advancement. The Intellectual Devotional is a secular version of the same: a collection of 365 short lessons that will inspire and invigorate the reader every day of the year. Each daily digest of wisdom is drawn from one of seven fields of knowledge: history, literature, philosophy, mathematics and science, religion, fine arts, and music. Impress your friends by explaining Plato&apos;s Cave allegory, pepper your cocktail-party conversation with opera terms, and unlock the mystery of how batteries work. Daily readings range from important passages in literature to the basic principles of physics, from pivotal events in history to analysis of famous works of art.\r\n\r\nThis book&apos;s goal is to refresh knowledge we&apos;ve forgotten, help us to make new discoveries, and exercise modes of thinking that are ordinarily neglected once our school days are behind us. Offering an escape from the daily grind to contemplate higher things, The Intellectual Devotional is a great way to awaken in the morning or to revitalize one&apos;s mind before retiring in the evening.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-01-28T12:04:32.324Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5b1fe4f792de2443ca8b569971cf3596d1acb36","dn":"The Intellectual Devotional_ Revive Your Mind by D.
