This number is divided by 1,024, giving the information of how much GB is allocated per day. Then create a clock to tick at every second.\r\n\r\nHow is this useful???\r\n\r\nTo stay current is to stay behind your current portion of data allocation throughout the month. Let us say you downloaded a large game and you are ahead your current portion of data allocation throughout the month. This Excel will tell you the precise date and time down to the second when you are not exceeding your current portion of data allocation throughout the month, albeit you stop consuming data immediately.\r\n\r\nWhat if I do not want to stop consuming data??? But want to continue but cautiously???\r\n\r\nAdd extra data under Intend to Use and the Excel calculator will automatically calculate the extra data and inform the user the precise the date and time when you will be in the clear.\r\n\r\nWho is this for???\r\n\r\nAnyone who can use some assistance in data consumption discipline. Please note, you must have a sense of understanding Excel worksheets. This is not difficult to understand but you must read what is what.\r\n\r\nIf you like and want to donate:\r\n\r\nBitcoin BTC: 3H3QWSbea9uWZnJ1VH9V2ExKtUPJawVmZf\r\nBitcoin Cash BCH: qpxhp8ezx0zwwec20a0dxulda36j8z6sxsljjqw54q\r\nEthereum ETH: 0x22b5136793b9cCbF05C5623Eee169A76AC80214B\r\nLitecoin LTC: LNCL7jMiYBF81AS7gTWL5nZ2ZQUNQErg8t\r\n\r\nCreator: Jamal HAMADE\r\nBe well","last_updated":"2018-03-24T12:11:32.673Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:410e80f70f66a1912631b2b871326b66e9c5cc02","dn":"Comcast Data Cap Excel Calculator","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"410e80f70f66a1912631b2b871326b66e9c5cc02","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,14,128,247,15,102,161,145,38,49,178,184,113,50,107,102,233,197,204,2]},"name":"Comcast Data Cap Excel Calculator","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
