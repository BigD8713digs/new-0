The show was produced by CBS Paramount Network Television and Junction Entertainment, with executive producers Jon Turteltaub, Stephen Chbosky, and Carol Barbee. It was shown in more than 30 countries.\r\n\r\nJericho ran on CBS from September 20, 2006, to March 25, 2008. It was canceled after its first full season, because of poor ratings. A fan campaign persuaded the network to bring the show back for another season, of seven episodes, after which it was canceled again. In November 2008, TV Guide reported that The CW would air repeats of Jericho to replace the canceled series Valentine.[2] In 2007, Jericho was ranked #11 on TV Guide&apos;s Top Cult Shows Ever.[3] In 2009, plans were announced for a feature film based on the series[4] and a continuation of the Jericho storylines in a comic-book series.[5][6] IDW Publishing released a new comic-book series for Season 4 in August 2012","last_updated":"2017-06-25T12:02:53.687Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ec2be06d25b50de6139646a1cf6663da49e62c4","dn":"Jericho (2006)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"0ec2be06d25b50de6139646a1cf6663da49e62c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,194,190,6,210,91,80,222,97,57,100,106,28,246,102,61,164,158,98,196]},"name":"Jericho (2006)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
