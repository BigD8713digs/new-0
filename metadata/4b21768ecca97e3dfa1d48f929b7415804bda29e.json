But while his songs and music have been endlessly discussed and analyzed, Jeff has rarely talked so directly about himself, his life, and his artistic process.\r\n\r\nUntil now. In his long-awaited memoir, Jeff will tell stories about his childhood in Belleville, Illinois; the St. Louis record store, rock clubs, and live-music circuit that sparked his songwriting and performing career; and the Chicago scene that brought it all together. He&apos;ll also talk in-depth about his collaborators in Uncle Tupelo, Wilco, and more; and write lovingly about his parents, wife Susie, and sons, Spencer and Sammy.\r\n\r\nHonest, funny, and disarming, Tweedy&apos;s memoir will bring readers inside both his life and his musical process, illuminating his singular genius and sharing his story, voice, and perspective for the first time.\r\n\r\nGenre: Non-Fiction &gt; Autobiography &gt; Memoir","last_updated":"2018-11-13T12:27:05.279Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:4b21768ecca97e3dfa1d48f929b7415804bda29e","dn":"Let's Go (So We Can Get Back) by Jeff Tweedy (.epub)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"4b21768ecca97e3dfa1d48f929b7415804bda29e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,33,118,142,204,169,126,61,250,29,72,249,41,183,65,88,4,189,162,158]},"name":"Let's Go (So We Can Get Back) by Jeff Tweedy (.epub)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
