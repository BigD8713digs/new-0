In May 2007 they made a tour in northern Germany, and recorded their first duo CD, &#x201C;Room 2 Room&#x201D;, which was released on Konnex Records in January, 2009. The duo combines the rich and varied textures of Morgan&#x2019;s sax sound with the transformational possibilities of Casserley&#x2019;s real time computer processing. All the sounds produced by both players stem from the sax, with Casserley using only sounds captured in real time as the source material for his transformations, creating a deep and intricate fusion of the two sound worlds.\r\nAs well as accomplished performers, both participants are experienced lecturers and workshop leaders. In 2009 they received invitations to perform at the &quot;Gemdays&quot; Festival at the University of Huddersfield (January), as well as the &quot;On the Edge&quot; concert series at the University of Hull @ Scarborough (February), where the programmes included workshops and pre-concert talks","last_updated":"2017-08-26T12:02:15.882Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b9a127a5254dad9fbf053108a70f4791ef49431","dn":"Lawrence Casserley &amp; Jeffrey Morgan 2008 Room 2 Room","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"6b9a127a5254dad9fbf053108a70f4791ef49431","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,154,18,122,82,84,218,217,251,240,83,16,138,112,244,121,30,244,148,49]},"name":"Lawrence Casserley &amp; Jeffrey Morgan 2008 Room 2 Room","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
