Tipler, Ralph A. Llewellyn\r\nISBN-13: 9781429250788\r\nBOOK SPECS: https://store.macmillanlearning.com/us/product/Modern-Physics/p/142925078X\r\nFILE SPECS:\r\n  text: true PDF, logical page numbers as in the print version, bookmarks, 15 MB\r\n  solutions: true PDF, bookmarks, 11 MB\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: For the intermediate-level course, the Sixth Edition of this widely used text takes modern physics textbooks to a higher level.  With a flexible approach to accommodate the various ways of teaching the course (both one- and two-term tracks are easily covered), the authors recognize the audience and its need for updated coverage, mathematical rigor, and features to build and support student understanding.\r\n \r\nContinued are the superb explanatory style, the up-to-date topical coverage, and the Web enhancements that gained earlier editions worldwide recognition. The Sixth Edition includes the discoveries that have further enlarged modern physics in the first decade of the new century, takes note of the evolution that is occurring in the teaching of physics in colleges and universities, and recognizes the growing role of modern physics in the biological sciences.\r\n\r\nBRIEF CONTENTS:\r\n---------------\r\nPART 1  Relativity and Quantum Mechanics: The Foundations of Modern Physics\r\n 1.
