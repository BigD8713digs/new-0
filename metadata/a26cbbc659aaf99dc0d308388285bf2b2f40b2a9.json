Walker, are once again at war. Having sided with the peaceful Lemurians against the savage, reptilian Grik, they now find themselves scrambling to prepare for the attack that is sure to come, searching for resources to support their forces&#x2014;even as they look for allies to join their struggle. \r\n\r\nAmagi, also trapped in this strange world, is under Grik control&#x2014;with her fanatical commander approaching madness. And soon they will have amassed a force that no amount of firepower and technology will be able to stop. \r\n\r\n&#x201C;Anderson has brought a fresh new perspective to the tale of crosstime shipwreck.&#x201D; &#x2014;&#x2013;S.M.
