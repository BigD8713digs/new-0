Dick EPUB\r\n\r\nOn a ravaged Earth, fate and circumstances bring together a disparate group of characters, including a fascist with dreams of a coup, a composer who plays his instrument with his mind, a First Lady who calls all the shots, and the world&#x2019;s last practicing therapist. And they all must contend with an underclass that is beginning to ask a few too many questions, aided by a man called Loony Luke and his very persuasive pet alien.\r\n\r\nIn classic Philip K. Dick fashion, The Simulacra combines time travel, psychotherapy, telekinesis, androids, and Neanderthal-like mutants to create a rousing, mind-bending story where there are conspiracies within conspiracies and nothing is ever what it seems.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-12-09T12:07:12.376Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:f77f420c7f3118cc1ec2b4f7ebdeb6c2bf1f3d37","dn":"The Simulacra by Philip K.
