The band has produced eight gold albums, three multi-platinum albums (Leftoverture, Point of Know Return, The Best of Kansas), one platinum live album (Two for the Show) and a million-selling single, &quot;Dust in the Wind&quot;. Kansas appeared on the Billboard charts for over 200 weeks throughout the 1970s and 1980s and played to sold-out arenas and stadiums throughout North America, Europe and Japan. &quot;Carry On Wayward Son&quot; was the second-most-played track on US classic rock radio in 1995 and No. 1 in 1997. Move ahead and back this show was done right before the original band went different directions. It is one of the cleanest sounding Live shows around that has not been taken away and commercially sold. \r\nBut then again this is a Analogkid Deluxe edition\r\nSo there are a few bonus tracks mixxed in cause thats how I do it\r\n\r\nTraklist\r\n\r\n01 Fight Fire with Fire.mp3\r\n02 Point of Know Return.mp3\r\n03 Everybody&apos;s My Friend.mp3\r\n04 What&apos;s On My Mind.mp3\r\n05 Play the Game Tonight.mp3\r\n06 Hold On.mp3\r\n07 Andi.mp3\r\n08 Dust In The Wind.mp3\r\n09 Piano Solo.mp3\r\n10 Crossfire.mp3\r\n11 Get Rich.mp3\r\n12 Belexes.mp3\r\n13 Magnum Opus.mp3\r\n14 Carry On Wayward Son.mp3\r\n15 Mainstream.mp3\r\n16 Portrait (He Knew).mp3\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrent members\r\n\r\n    Phil Ehart - drums, percussion (1973&#x2013;1984, 1985&#x2013;present), management (1990&#x2013;present)\r\n    Rich Williams - lead guitar (1973&#x2013;1984, 1989&#x2013;1990, 1991&#x2013;present), rhythm guitar (1973&#x2013;1984, 1985&#x2013;1991, 1997&#x2013;2006)\r\n    Billy Greer - bass, backing vocals (1985&#x2013;present), lead vocals (1999&#x2013;present), acoustic guitar (1990, 1995, 1999&#x2013;2000, 2016)\r\n    David Ragsdale - violin, additional rhythm guitar, backing vocals (1991&#x2013;1997, 2006&#x2013;present)\r\n    Ronnie Platt - lead and backing vocals, keyboards (2014&#x2013;present)\r\n    David Manion - keyboards, backing vocals (2014&#x2013;present)\r\n    Zak Rizvi - rhythm guitar, additional lead guitar, backing vocals (2016&#x2013;present)\r\n\r\nPast members\r\n\r\n    Kerry Livgren - lead guitar (1973&#x2013;1983, 1990&#x2013;1991, 1999&#x2013;2000), rhythm guitar, keyboards (1973&#x2013;1983, 1999&#x2013;2000), backing vocals (1973&#x2013;1974)\r\n    Dave Hope - bass (1973&#x2013;1983, 1990, 1999&#x2013;2000), backing vocals (1973&#x2013;1974)\r\n    Robby Steinhardt - violin, viola, backing and lead vocals (1973&#x2013;1982, 1997&#x2013;2006)\r\n    Steve Walsh - lead vocals, keyboards, additional percussion (1973&#x2013;1981, 1985&#x2013;2014), backing vocals (1973&#x2013;1981, 1997&#x2013;2014)\r\n    John Elefante - lead vocals, keyboards (1982&#x2013;1984), backing vocals (1982&#x2013;1983)\r\n    Steve Morse - lead guitar (1985&#x2013;1991)\r\n    Greg Robert - keyboards, backing vocals (1990&#x2013;1997; Touring member: 1986&#x2013;1990)","last_updated":"2017-10-23T12:07:47.748Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:1568daefad5a7bcabf0ac0ad5e05d96973f1c287","dn":"Kansas - Universal Amphitheater, L A (Deluxe) 1983 ak320","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"1568daefad5a7bcabf0ac0ad5e05d96973f1c287","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,104,218,239,173,90,123,202,191,10,192,173,94,5,217,105,115,241,194,135]},"name":"Kansas - Universal Amphitheater, L A (Deluxe) 1983 ak320","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
