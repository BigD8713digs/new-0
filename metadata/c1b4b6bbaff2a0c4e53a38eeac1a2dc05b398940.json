Scott Bakker ePUB eBOOK-ZAK\r\n\r\nStrikingly original in its conception, ambitious in scope, with characters engrossingly and vividly drawn, the first book in R. Scott Bakker&apos;s Prince of Nothing series creates a remarkable world from whole cloth - its language and classes of people, its cities, religions, mysteries, taboos, and rituals - the kind of all-embracing universe Tolkien and Herbert created unforgettably in the epic fantasies The Lord of the Rings and Dune.\r\n\r\nIt&apos;s a world scarred by an apocalyptic past, evoking a time both 2,000 years past and 2,000 years into the future, as untold thousands gather for a crusade. Among them, two men and two women are ensnared by a mysterious traveler, Anas&#xFB;rimbor Kellhus - part warrior, part philosopher, part sorcerous, charismatic presence - from lands long thought dead. The Darkness That Comes Before is a history of this great holy war, and like all histories, the survivors write its conclusion.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-07-30T12:00:30.445Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:c1b4b6bbaff2a0c4e53a38eeac1a2dc05b398940","dn":"The Darkness That Comes Before (The Prince of Nothing series_boo","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"c1b4b6bbaff2a0c4e53a38eeac1a2dc05b398940","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,180,182,187,175,242,160,196,229,58,56,238,172,26,45,192,91,57,137,64]},"name":"The Darkness That Comes Before (The Prince of Nothing series_boo","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
