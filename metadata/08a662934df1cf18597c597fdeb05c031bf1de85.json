Now the award-winning journalist tells the complete story of Cunanan, his unwitting victims, and the moneyed, hedonistic world in which they lived and died, culled from interviews with more than four hundred people and details from thousands of pages of police reports.\r\n\r\nIn chilling detail, Maureen Orth reveals how Andrew Cunanan met his superstar victim; why police and the FBI repeatedly failed to catch Cunanan; why other victims&#x2019; families stonewalled the investigation; controversial findings of the Versace autopsy report; and more.\r\n\r\nHere is a late-century odyssey that races across America from California&#x2019;s wealthy gay underworld to modest midwestern homes of families mourning their slaughtered sons to the celebration of decadence that is Versace&#x2019;s South Beach. It is at once a landmark work of investigative journalism and a riveting account of a sociopath, his savage crimes, and the mysteries he left along the way","last_updated":"2017-06-03T12:05:37.530Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:08a662934df1cf18597c597fdeb05c031bf1de85","dn":"Vulgar Favors: Cunanan, Gianni Versace and the Largest Failed...","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"08a662934df1cf18597c597fdeb05c031bf1de85","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,166,98,147,77,241,207,24,89,124,89,127,222,176,92,3,27,241,222,133]},"name":"Vulgar Favors: Cunanan, Gianni Versace and the Largest Failed...","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
