From then on (and even before that), Yandolino, a beguiling fast-talker, charmer, and gifted storyteller, took charge of his life according to those ideals, grabbing and embracing all opportunities that were thrown his way.\r\n\r\nThis memoir is an account of his life as a hippie, art director, entrepreneur, manager, and screenwriter (as well as various other hats he wore in the creative industry) - representing musicians like Joe Cocker and Paul Butterfield, art directing at Penthouse magazine, designing &quot;erotic sheets,&quot; and writing a screenplay about Marilyn Monroe and her seamstress Lena Pepitone, among other things. With his gung-ho attitude and fortuitous connections, Yandolino befriended Salvador Dali, hung out with Jimi Hendrix, ran with Abbie Hoffman, was kidnapped by a festival security detail in Paris, mixed with models and Penthouse pets, and watched secret Hells Angels initiation ceremonies. Throughout it all, Yandolino&apos;s key message is his &quot;free bird&quot; philosophy of grabbing every chance you can and staying true to one&apos;s artistic individuality. And, in the end, despite his fast life, he was always grounded by his love for his wife, Charli.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-11-13T12:01:02.481Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:20373963982e33b222c4910ee2415ece8a9081f4","dn":"Frank n Charli_ Woodstock, True Love .. by Frank Yandolino EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"20373963982e33b222c4910ee2415ece8a9081f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,55,57,99,152,46,51,178,34,196,145,14,226,65,94,206,138,144,129,244]},"name":"Frank n Charli_ Woodstock, True Love .. by Frank Yandolino EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
