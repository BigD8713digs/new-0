Its irreverent mix of bad language, childish cartoons and sharp satire has seen its creators hauled over the coals by the United Nations, questioned by Scotland Yard&#x2019;s anti-terrorist branch and exhibited in the Tate Gallery. Viz&#x2019;s comic characters, such as the Fat Slags, Sid the Sexist, and Roger Mellie the foul-mouthed Man on the Telly,as well as its hugely popular Top Tips and Profanisaurus sections, are firmly established as national institutions, just like Broadmoor Hospital for the Criminally Insane.\r\n\r\nViz &#x2013; November 2017\r\nEnglish | 52 Pages | True PDF | 33 MB","last_updated":"2017-11-08T12:20:36.733Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:a25e988b0fd3535b6bb915a3cf0c0996c3c83224","dn":"Viz - November 2017.pdf","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"a25e988b0fd3535b6bb915a3cf0c0996c3c83224","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,94,152,139,15,211,83,91,107,185,21,163,207,12,9,150,195,200,50,36]},"name":"Viz - November 2017.pdf","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
