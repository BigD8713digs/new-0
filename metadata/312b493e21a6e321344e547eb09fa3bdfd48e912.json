When she sees a man lying in the backyard, stabbed to death, she has only one terrified thought: What have I done?\r\n\r\nAgreeing to take the case as a favor to her PI friend Lincoln Sharp, Morgan must scale a mountain of damning circumstantial and forensic evidence to prove her client innocent. Haley couldn&#x2019;t appear more guilty: her bloodstained fingerprints are on the murder weapon, and she has no alibi. But Morgan can&#x2019;t shake the feeling that this shocked young woman has been framed.\r\n\r\nSomeone out there is hell-bent on sabotaging her defense, targeting Morgan, her partner, and especially Haley. Someone who will stop at nothing - and whose next move will be deadly.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-10-14T12:02:23.673Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:312b493e21a6e321344e547eb09fa3bdfd48e912","dn":"What I've Done (Morgan Dane, Book 4) by Melinda Leigh EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"312b493e21a6e321344e547eb09fa3bdfd48e912","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,43,73,62,33,166,227,33,52,78,84,126,176,159,163,189,253,72,233,18]},"name":"What I've Done (Morgan Dane, Book 4) by Melinda Leigh EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
