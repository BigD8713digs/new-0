What was once a way she escaped her insecurity and negativity as a teenager became a means of coping with the anxiety and stress of an impossible workload.\r\n\r\nGirl Walks Out of a Bar explores Smith&apos;s formative years, her decade of alcohol and drug abuse, divorce, and her road to recovery. In this darkly comic and wrenchingly honest story, Smith describes how her circumstances conspired with her predisposition to depression and self-medication in an environment ripe for addiction to flourish. When her close-knit group of high-achieving friends celebrate the end of their grueling workdays with alcohol-fueled nights at the city&apos;s clubs and summer weekends partying at the beach, the feel-good times can spiral wildly out of control.\r\n\r\nGirl Walks Out of a Bar is a candid portrait of alcoholism through the lens of gritty New York realism. Beneath the fa&#xE7;ade of success lies the reality of addiction.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-10-07T12:01:00.478Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:26c04217247cc9b484a541c574c4a0692da74e33","dn":"Girl Walks Out of a Bar_ A Memoir by Lisa Smith ePUB eBOOK-ZAK","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"26c04217247cc9b484a541c574c4a0692da74e33","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,192,66,23,36,124,201,180,132,165,65,197,116,196,160,105,45,167,78,51]},"name":"Girl Walks Out of a Bar_ A Memoir by Lisa Smith ePUB eBOOK-ZAK","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
