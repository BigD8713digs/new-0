Well, do you really understand how they work?  If you struggle with algorithms, it means you are approaching this topic the wrong way!  There are lots of places to copy code from, but without having high level understanding, it can be difficult to handle data structures well.   This course teaches the fundamentals of algorithms, so you can apply knowledge easily.  This course contains NO PROGRAMMING, JUST PSEUDOCODE to encourage understanding of Algorithms and how to use themWhatever the reason, if you are looking for a course that focus on the implementations to give you a complete understanding of how things work, then this is the course for you.  This course is a combination of two courses I took as an undergraduate and taught to graduate students at Cornell and Stanford.  This course goes over the theory of how things work, but only to give you what you need to know to understand the implementation covered.\r\n\r\nWho is the target audience?\r\n\r\n    Anyone interested in programming in any language.\r\n    Developers who have some knowledge of Python or Java looking to understand data structures and algorithms at a deep level\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n\r\n    Some programming experience is helpful but not required","last_updated":"2018-07-12T12:08:09.302Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d7642336177cdcdcc3463bd29bc2ac84bd653e9","dn":"Udemy - Data Structures and Algorithms - High Level MADE EASY","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"0d7642336177cdcdcc3463bd29bc2ac84bd653e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,118,66,51,97,119,205,205,204,52,99,189,41,188,42,200,75,214,83,233]},"name":"Udemy - Data Structures and Algorithms - High Level MADE EASY","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
