Between mouthfuls of food and over the polite scrapings of cutlery, the conversation remains a gentle hum of polite discourse &#x2013; the banality of work, the triviality of the holidays. But behind the empty words, terrible things need to be said, and with every forced smile and every new course, the knives are being sharpened.\r\nEach couple has a fifteen-year-old son. The two boys are united by their accountability for a single horrific act; an act that has triggered a police investigation and shattered the comfortable, insulated worlds of their families. As the dinner reaches its culinary climax, the conversation finally touches on their children. As civility and friendship disintegrate, each couple show just how far they are prepared to go to protect those they love.\r\nTautly written, incredibly gripping, and told by an unforgettable narrator, The Dinner promises to be the topic of countless dinner party debates. Skewering everything from parenting values to pretentious menus to political convictions, this novel reveals the dark side of genteel society and asks what each of us would do in the face of unimaginable tragedy","last_updated":"2017-09-22T12:09:11.101Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:294054f8cfa4da08e5cd03228c46c93381585a62","dn":"Herman Koch: The Dinner","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"294054f8cfa4da08e5cd03228c46c93381585a62","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,64,84,248,207,164,218,8,229,205,3,34,140,70,201,51,129,88,90,98]},"name":"Herman Koch: The Dinner","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
