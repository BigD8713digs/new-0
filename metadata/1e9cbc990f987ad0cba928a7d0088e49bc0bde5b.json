But if you think Sharp is heading toward his dotage, or feels circumscribed by mortality, the prickly immediacy of this music&#x2014;with 73-year-old drummer Barry Altschul as its fearless co-pilot&#x2014;will set you straight.\r\nAggregat is the umpteenth ensemble Sharp has shepherded since becoming a staple of the New York City experimental music scene in the late 1970s. The group began in 2012 as a trio playing some of the most conventional jazz in Sharp&#x2019;s voluminous discography, but Dialectrical, as with the second Aggregat disc from 2013, features a knotty quintet with Sharp (most renowned as a guitarist) as the lone reed alongside two brass and a piano-less rhythm section. Much of the overtly composed stuff is unison prancing, a baseline from which to stagger and drag the rhythms or engage in what Sharp calls &#x201C;free-floating crosstalk.&#x201D;... - Britt Robson, jazztimes.com","last_updated":"2017-04-23T18:01:09.987Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e9cbc990f987ad0cba928a7d0088e49bc0bde5b","dn":"Elliott Sharp Aggregat 2016 Dialectrical","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"1e9cbc990f987ad0cba928a7d0088e49bc0bde5b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,156,188,153,15,152,122,208,203,169,40,167,208,8,142,73,188,11,222,91]},"name":"Elliott Sharp Aggregat 2016 Dialectrical","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
