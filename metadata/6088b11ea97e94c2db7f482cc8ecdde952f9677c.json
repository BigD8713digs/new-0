However, things have changed, and they continue changing at a maddening pace. One new technique after another has made it easier, faster, and above all cheaper to produce the material, which has taken on an increasing variety of forms. \r\n\r\nThe Historical Dictionary of Animation and Cartoons is an introduction to all aspects of animation history and its development as a technology and industry beyond the familiar cartoons from the Disney and Warner Bros. Studios. This is done through a chronology, an introductory essay, photos, a bibliography, and over 200 cross-referenced dictionary entries on animators, directors, studios, techniques, films, and some of the best-known characters","last_updated":"2017-06-03T12:00:19.590Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:6088b11ea97e94c2db7f482cc8ecdde952f9677c","dn":"Historical Dictionary of Animation and Cartoons (2009) Gooner","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"6088b11ea97e94c2db7f482cc8ecdde952f9677c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,136,177,30,169,126,148,194,219,127,72,44,200,236,221,233,82,249,103,124]},"name":"Historical Dictionary of Animation and Cartoons (2009) Gooner","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
