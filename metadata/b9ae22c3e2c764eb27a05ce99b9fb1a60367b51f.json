This remarkable four-part documentary series provides intimate insight into Putin&apos;s personal and professional lives, from his childhood under communism, to his rise to power, his relations with four U.S. presidents, and his surprising takes on U.S.-Russian relations today. Witness the most detailed portrait of Putin ever granted to a Western interviewer.\r\n\r\n\r\nMediaInfo\r\n\r\nGENERAL : Matroska / 58mn 21s\r\n\r\nVIDEO : AVC / 1920 x 1080 / 16:9 / 23.976 (24000/1001) fps / 8 bits / 9588 kbps / High@L4 / Progressive / BT.709\r\n\r\nAUDIO 1 : English / E-AC-3 / 5.1ch / 640 kbps\r\n\r\nSUBTITLE 1 : UTF-8\r\n\r\nSCREENSHOTS: <a href=\" https://imgur.com/a/U0m6JXM\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\"> https://imgur.com/a/U0m6JXM</a>","last_updated":"2018-05-20T12:12:54.443Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9ae22c3e2c764eb27a05ce99b9fb1a60367b51f","dn":"The Putin Interviews S01 1080p AMZN WEBRip DD5.1 x264-NTb","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"b9ae22c3e2c764eb27a05ce99b9fb1a60367b51f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,174,34,195,226,199,100,235,39,160,92,233,155,159,177,166,3,103,181,31]},"name":"The Putin Interviews S01 1080p AMZN WEBRip DD5.1 x264-NTb","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
