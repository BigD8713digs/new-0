Offering children gems of advice such as &quot;strive to learn&quot; and &quot;be not a dunce&quot;, it was no fun at all. So how did we get from there to &quot;let the wild rumpus start&quot;? And now that we&apos;re living in a golden age of children&apos;s literature, what can adults get out of reading Where the Wild Things Are and Goodnight Moon or Charlotte&apos;s Web and Little House on the Prairie?\r\n\r\nIn Wild Things, Vanity Fair contributing editor Bruce Handy revisits the classics of every American childhood, from fairy tales to The Very Hungry Caterpillar, and explores the back stories of their creators, using context and biography to understand how some of the most insightful, creative, and witty authors and illustrators of their times created their often deeply personal masterpieces. Along the way Handy learns what The Cat in the Hat says about anarchy and absentee parenting, which themes are shared by The Runaway Bunny and Portnoy&apos;s Complaint, and why Ramona Quimby is as true an American icon as Tom Sawyer or Jay Gatsby.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-08-20T12:00:42.540Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2d9ed00c7b827f1cb1f5c9455bbd071d7dbf6cb","dn":"Wild Things_ The Joy of Reading Childrens Literature as an Adult","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"f2d9ed00c7b827f1cb1f5c9455bbd071d7dbf6cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,217,237,0,199,184,39,241,203,31,92,148,85,187,208,113,215,219,246,203]},"name":"Wild Things_ The Joy of Reading Childrens Literature as an Adult","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
