Twins are separated in a shipwreck, and forced to fend for themselves in a strange land. The first twin, Viola, falls in love with Orsino, who dotes on OIivia, who falls for Viola but is idolised by Malvolio. Enter Sebastian, who is the spitting image of his twin sister...\r\n\r\nCast and Creatives\r\n\r\ndirected for the stage by Christopher Luscombe\r\ndirected for the screen by Robin Lough\r\nmusic composed by Nigel Hess\r\npresenter  Suzy Klein\r\n\r\nCast given in order of the credit roll\r\n\r\nOrsino                           Nicholas Bishop\r\nValentine                        Tom Byrne\r\nCurio                            Luke Latchman\r\nAntonio                          Giles Taylor \r\nOlivia                           Kara Tointon\r\nSir Toby Belch                   John Hodgkinson\r\nSir Andrew Aguecheek             Michael Cochrane\r\nMalvolio                         Adrian Edmondson\r\nMaria                            Vivien Parry\r\nFeste                            Berus Khan\r\nViola                            Dinita Gohil\r\nSebastian                        Esh Alladi\r\n\r\n  complete cast and creatives in the credit roll\r\n\r\nMy Notes\r\n\r\n   Each production of a play brings new elements of interpretation.  In my\r\ncollections there have been many varieties for Twelfth Night and those can be found from The Globe and NTLive.  Here the musical elements are so significant I include Nigel Hess\r\nat the top with the two directors. \r\n\r\n  These are recodes of existing torrents.  No dvds are made for distribution which\r\nI nomrally admonish the viewer to get for libraries and school collections.\r\nBut the host site RSC notes that the music is available for download (but not on cd) in some manner.  That, I think,  is worthwhile.\r\n\r\n  Notes written March 11th  2018","last_updated":"2018-03-11T12:10:51.984Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:39b6ea4725ea15f98551926f88a61ab17a3cc412","dn":"RSC Live Shakespeares Twelfth Night (2018)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"39b6ea4725ea15f98551926f88a61ab17a3cc412","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,182,234,71,37,234,21,249,133,81,146,111,136,166,26,177,122,60,196,18]},"name":"RSC Live Shakespeares Twelfth Night (2018)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
