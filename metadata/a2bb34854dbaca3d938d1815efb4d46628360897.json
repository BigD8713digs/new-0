I could be \r\nkeeping a list of the vomit clowns that post voluminously every day\r\nin amounts that they cannot possibly service in any reasonable amount\r\nof time, not to mention the complete lack of description, and my\r\npersonal favorite is the gigabyte zip file with no listing of the\r\ncontents. Yes, I could be keeping a list and checking it twice but \r\nthe fact is that if you can&apos;t be bothered then neither can I because \r\nit&apos;s just junk to pump up your numbers with. And that reminds me I \r\nhave to delete my collection of 437 how-to and how-big and how-hard\r\nis your penis ebooks.\r\nEnough with the negative though. This is a time when history is being\r\nmade. Our president (ya-fired!) is about to begin a meeting whose \r\noutcome will have global consequences. Yes, that&apos;s right, this is the\r\nbeginning of the end of N Korea. In 5 years that peninnsula will be \r\ncompletely paved over in Big-Mac cartons and styrofoam take-out \r\ncontainers, no house will be worth less than a million bucks, all\r\nforested areas will be thinned into parkland and the native wildlife\r\nwill have been relocated to zoo&apos;s. Ah, the stink of civilization. I \r\ncan only say... don&apos;t do it Kim! Press that button now and preserve\r\nthe simple uncluttered way of living. Death to twitter,\r\nand #me-too...\r\nwoops, too much positive energy there.\r\n\r\nNotch Johnson just saying,\r\nRide the big one.\r\n\r\n\r\n Wall Street Journal Saturday-Sunday 09-10 June 2018","last_updated":"2018-06-10T12:13:58.754Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2bb34854dbaca3d938d1815efb4d46628360897","dn":"Wall Street Journal Saturday 9 June 2018","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"a2bb34854dbaca3d938d1815efb4d46628360897","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,187,52,133,77,186,202,61,147,141,24,21,239,180,212,102,40,54,8,151]},"name":"Wall Street Journal Saturday 9 June 2018","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
