It&apos;s a &quot;suicide economy,&quot; David Korten says, and it destroys the very foundations of its own existence.\r\n\r\nThe best-selling 1995 edition of When Corporations Rule the World helped launch a global resistance against corporate domination. In this 20th-anniversary edition, Korten shares insights from his personal experience as a participant in the growing movement for a new economy. A new introduction documents the further concentration of wealth and corporate power since 1995 and explores why our institutions resolutely resist even modest reform. A new conclusion chapter outlines high-leverage opportunities for breakthrough change.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-09-19T12:42:46.043Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba0fceaf32f4c2bec6c8b567b95ad2a8544c5de3","dn":"When Corporations Rule the World by David C Korten ePUB eBOOK-ZA","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"ba0fceaf32f4c2bec6c8b567b95ad2a8544c5de3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,15,206,175,50,244,194,190,198,200,181,103,185,90,210,168,84,76,93,227]},"name":"When Corporations Rule the World by David C Korten ePUB eBOOK-ZA","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
