Behind the benign smile of the &quot;People&apos;s Pope&quot; Colonna reveals a ruthless autocrat aggressively asserting the powers of the papacy in pursuit of a radical agenda.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-05-12T12:00:52.306Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:0dcef8f3d3681b9ce5476d35d0ffbad462ec48d3","dn":"The Dictator Pope by Marcantonio Colonna MOBI","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"0dcef8f3d3681b9ce5476d35d0ffbad462ec48d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,206,248,243,211,104,27,156,229,71,109,53,208,255,186,212,98,236,72,211]},"name":"The Dictator Pope by Marcantonio Colonna MOBI","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
