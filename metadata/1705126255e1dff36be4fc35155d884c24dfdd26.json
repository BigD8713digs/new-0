Memory and Emotion spans all these areas and brings them together into one volume. Daniel Reisberg and Paula Hertel have assembled contributions from the most visible and productive researchers working at the intersection of emotion and memory. The result is a sophisticated profile of our current understanding of how memory is shaped both by emotion and emotional disorder. The diverse list of topics includes the biology of traumatic memory, the memory disorders produced by depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia, the nature of emotional memory both in children and the elderly, and the collective memory processes at work in remembering the Holocaust. This unified collection of cutting-edge research will be an invaluable guide to scholars and students in many different research areas.\r\n\r\n978-0195158564","last_updated":"2017-06-15T12:03:21.689Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:1705126255e1dff36be4fc35155d884c24dfdd26","dn":"Memory and Emotion (Series in Affective Science)(Oxford)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"1705126255e1dff36be4fc35155d884c24dfdd26","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,5,18,98,85,225,223,243,107,228,252,53,21,93,136,76,36,223,221,38]},"name":"Memory and Emotion (Series in Affective Science)(Oxford)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
