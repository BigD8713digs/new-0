She calls this system carnism.\r\n\r\nCarnism is the belief system, or ideology, that allows us to selectively choose which animals become our meat, and it is sustained by complex psychological and social mechanisms. Like other &quot;isms&quot; (racism, ageism, etc.), carnism is most harmful when it is unrecognized and unacknowledged. Why We Love Dogs, Eat Pigs, and Wear Cows names and explains this phenomenon and offers it up for examination. Unlike the many books that explain why we shouldn&apos;t eat meat, Joy&apos;s book explains why we do eat meat - and thus how we can make more informed choices as citizens and consumers.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-11-04T12:02:14.815Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:80749164e6e2a56b75c3363997a9e250785990f7","dn":"Why We Love Dogs, Eat Pigs, and Wear Cows by Melanie Joy EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"80749164e6e2a56b75c3363997a9e250785990f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,116,145,100,230,226,165,107,117,195,54,57,151,169,226,80,120,89,144,247]},"name":"Why We Love Dogs, Eat Pigs, and Wear Cows by Melanie Joy EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
