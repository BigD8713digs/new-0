The Nazis - A Warning From History exposes the popular myths surrounding the rise and fall of the Third Reich. The series explores how the Nazis came to power, how they ruled, how they treated their occupied territories and, above all, how a cultured nation could be responsible for such acts of inhumanity.\r\nHow could a political party as fundamentally evil and overtly racist as the Nazis come to power? This remains one of the most enigmatic questions of the last century. Acclaimed historian Laurence Rees examines what led a cultured nation at the heart of Europe to commit the atrocities it did. In so doing, he exposes popular myths and encourages understanding of the real forces that led to one of the darkest chapters in modern history. Was it simply the hypnotic power of Hitler&apos;s rhetoric? Did the Gestapo really impose themselves by terror on an unwilling population? Through interviews with witnesses and perpetrators, along with archive film and records, this six-part series unveils a more chilling reality.\r\n\r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n\r\n * Video Container: mkv\r\n * Video Bitrate: 5 MB/s\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\n * Video Resolution: 1920x1080\r\n * Frame Rate: 32 FPS\r\n * Audio Codec: AC-3\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 384 kb/s\r\n * Audio Channels: 2\r\n * Run-Time: 48 mins / part\r\n * Number of Parts: 6\r\n * Part Size: 1.75 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV","last_updated":"2017-12-06T12:07:28.960Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:87146af94ff2fc0bc7580e2b0dd7335047363b03","dn":"BBC The Nazis A Warning from History 1of6 Helped into Power 1080","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"87146af94ff2fc0bc7580e2b0dd7335047363b03","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,20,106,249,79,242,252,11,199,88,14,43,13,215,51,80,71,54,59,3]},"name":"BBC The Nazis A Warning from History 1of6 Helped into Power 1080","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
