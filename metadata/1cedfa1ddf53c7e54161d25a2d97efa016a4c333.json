Ambrose epub RtR\r\n\r\nEasy Company, 506th Airborne Division, U.S. Army, was as good a rifle company as any in the world. From their rigorous training in Georgia in 1942 to D-Day and victory, Ambrose tells the story of this remarkable company, which kept getting the tough assignments. Easy Company was responsible for everything from parachuting into France early D-Day morning to the capture of Hitler&apos;s Eagle&apos;s Nest at Berchtesgaden.\r\n\r\nBand of Brothers is the account of the men of this remarkable unit who fought, went hungry, froze, and died, a company that took 150 percent casualities and considered the Purple Heart a badge of office. Drawing on hours of interviews with survivors as well as the soldiers&apos; journals and letters, Stephen Ambrose tell the stories - often in the men&apos;s own words - of these American hereoes.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-07-16T12:00:27.509Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:1cedfa1ddf53c7e54161d25a2d97efa016a4c333","dn":"Band of Brothers by Stephen E.
