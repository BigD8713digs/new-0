The band was one of the first American hardcore bands to make a significant impact in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nDead Kennedys&apos; lyrics were usually political in nature, satirizing establishment political figures (both liberal and conservative) and authority in general, as well as popular culture and even the punk movement itself. \r\n\r\n Mabuhay Gardens (a.k.a. The Fab Mab or The Mab) was a San Francisco nightclub located at 443 Broadway, on the Broadway strip of North Beach, an area best known for its striptease clubs.By creating an exchange program, punk bands for England and NY came to the Mabuhay and vice versa, staying in each city performing a few nights at a time. This spread the &quot;punk&quot; scene globally making it a household word, thanks to Dirk Dirksen.\r\n\r\nTracklist\r\n01. Back To Rhodesia.mp3\r\n02. Stealing People&apos;s Mail.mp3\r\n03.
