Wallace was a brilliantly eccentric British explorer and, unlike Darwin, he came from a humble background and had to pay his own way by collecting animals.

Wallace changed the way we see life on earth but has since been written out of history. \r\n\r\nBill Bailey&apos;s Remarkable Guide to the Orchestra","last_updated":"2018-03-24T12:15:57.332Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca65302c9d1832679dde0c51ba25ff8ca8687b62","dn":"Bill Bailey Documentary Collection","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"ca65302c9d1832679dde0c51ba25ff8ca8687b62","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,101,48,44,157,24,50,103,157,222,12,81,186,37,255,140,168,104,123,98]},"name":"Bill Bailey Documentary Collection","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
