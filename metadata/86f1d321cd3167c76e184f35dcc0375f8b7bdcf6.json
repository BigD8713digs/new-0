With a contract in hand, she arrives in New York City with no apartment, no friends, and all the wrong clothes. But lucky for Darcy, she&apos;s taken under the wings of other seasoned and fledgling writers who help her navigate the city and the world of writing and publishing. Over the course of a year, Darcy finishes her book, faces critique, and falls in love.\r\n\r\nWoven into Darcy&apos;s personal story is her novel, Afterworlds, a suspenseful thriller about a teen who slips into the &quot;Afterworld&quot; to survive a terrorist attack. The Afterworld is a place between the living and the dead, and where many unsolved - and terrifying - stories need to be reconciled. Like Darcy, Lizzie, too, falls in love - until a new threat resurfaces, and her special gifts may not be enough to protect those she cares about most.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-09-20T12:21:05.669Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:86f1d321cd3167c76e184f35dcc0375f8b7bdcf6","dn":"Afterworlds by Scott Westerfeld EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"86f1d321cd3167c76e184f35dcc0375f8b7bdcf6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,241,211,33,205,49,103,199,110,24,79,53,220,192,55,95,139,123,220,246]},"name":"Afterworlds by Scott Westerfeld EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
