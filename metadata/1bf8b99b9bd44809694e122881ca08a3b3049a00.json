The tech gods believe progress is powered by technology tearing up the world as it is - a process they call disruption. He visits Uber&apos;s lavish offices in San Francisco and hears how the company believes it is improving our cities. But in Hyderabad in India, Jamie sees for himself the human consequences of Uber&apos;s utopian vision - drivers driven to suicide over falling earnings. Riding shotgun in a truck as it drives itself for more than a hundred miles on a highway, Jamie asks what the next wave of Silicon Valley&apos;s global disruption - the automation of millions of jobs - will mean for all of us. In search of answers, he gets a warning from an artificial intelligence pioneer who is replacing doctors with software - an economic shock is coming, faster than any of us have realised. Jamie&apos;s journey ends in the remote island hideout of a formerexecutive who has armed himself with a gun because he fears this new industrial revolution could lead to social breakdown and the collapse of capitalism","last_updated":"2017-08-08T12:05:13.319Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:1bf8b99b9bd44809694e122881ca08a3b3049a00","dn":"Secrets.of.Silicon.Valley.s01e01.The.Disrupters.EN.SUB.x264.MPup","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"1bf8b99b9bd44809694e122881ca08a3b3049a00","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,248,185,155,155,212,72,9,105,78,18,40,129,202,8,163,179,4,154,0]},"name":"Secrets.of.Silicon.Valley.s01e01.The.Disrupters.EN.SUB.x264.MPup","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
