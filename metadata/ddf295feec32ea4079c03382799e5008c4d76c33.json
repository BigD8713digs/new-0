Reid,a doctor who was made into a vampire, and whose thirst for blood compels him to kill innocent people.\r\nTo do this successfully, he must gather information about his targets--study and change their habits, collect clues,\r\nand maintain certain relationships by communicating with the sixty inhabitants of London,\r\nwhich serves as a fictionalised semi-open world built around hubs of seamless neighbourhoods tethered to other interlinking areas.\r\nIt is possible to finish the game without taking a life,which best preserves the character&apos;s cover as a doctor but leaves him nearly incapable of levelling up.\r\nKilling no one unlocks one of four different endings.\r\nThere is a skill tree that facilitates improvement of abilities, which is fuelled by experience points gained from blood and, alternatively, investigation.\r\nThe branches of the skill tree concern shadow, instinct, and social abilities...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPC System Requirements\r\nMinimum:\r\nMinimum:\r\nOS: Windows 7/8/10 (64 bits)\r\nProcessor: Intel Core i3-2130 (3.4 GHz)/AMD FX-4100 (3.6 GHz)\r\nMemory: 8 GB RAM\r\nGraphics: 2 GB, GeForce GTX 1050 (Legacy GPU: GeForce GTX 660) / Radeon R7 370\r\nStorage: 15 GB available space\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nThis version of game is already cracked - just install and play.\r\n\r\nMore info,future updates and support on www.nosteam.ro <a href=\"\nhttp://www.nosteam.ro/index.php?topic=9327.msg242490#msg242490\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttp://www.nosteam.ro/index.php?topic=9327.msg242490#msg242490</a>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to install:\r\nAfter download is done:\r\n- open &quot;Vampyr.exe&quot; ,\r\n- choose location ,\r\n- click install ,\r\n- wait until is done \r\n- play game from desktop shortcut.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you like this game torrent seed it to others.\r\nEnjoy","last_updated":"2018-06-07T12:14:39.714Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:ddf295feec32ea4079c03382799e5008c4d76c33","dn":"Vampyr PC game ^^nosTEAM^^","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"ddf295feec32ea4079c03382799e5008c4d76c33","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,242,149,254,236,50,234,64,121,192,51,130,121,158,80,8,196,215,108,51]},"name":"Vampyr PC game ^^nosTEAM^^","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
