Sexton shows that the American Revolution was a consequence of the increasing integration of the British and American economies; that a necessary precondition for the Civil War was the absence, for the first time in decades, of foreign threats; and that we cannot understand the New Deal without examining the role of European immigrants and their offspring in transforming the Democratic Party.\r\nA necessary corrective to conventional narratives of American history, A Nation Forged by Crisis argues that we can only prepare for our unpredictable future by first acknowledging the contingencies of our collective past.\r\n\r\nGenre: Non-Fiction &gt; History of U.S. Abolition","last_updated":"2018-10-17T12:32:19.080Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:28ebebeedbfffe90f04874fa52c39cf54f7fb7f6","dn":"A Nation Forged by Crisis by Jay Sexton (.epub)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"28ebebeedbfffe90f04874fa52c39cf54f7fb7f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,235,235,238,219,255,254,144,240,72,116,250,82,195,156,245,79,127,183,246]},"name":"A Nation Forged by Crisis by Jay Sexton (.epub)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
