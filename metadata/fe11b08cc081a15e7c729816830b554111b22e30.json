Hoagland - The Other Side of Midnight radio show MP3s\r\nAugust 2017 - \r\n\r\nThis is a collection of MP3s of The Other Side of Midnight, a radio program hosted by Richard C. Hoagland.  \r\n\r\nThe Other Side of Midnight now airs on the radio station KIYQ based in Las Vegas, Nevada and streaming via TuneIn and the show&apos;s own website.  It airs Saturdays and Sundays from 9pm-12am Pacific (12-3am Eastern).  From the website:     \r\n\r\n &quot;The Other Side of Midnight hosted by Richard C. Hoagland takes you on a journey through the minds of exceptional scientific experts, investigators and analysts. Hoagland takes you behind the scenes of history to explore science, the humanities and secret government projects, while comparing our own science fiction dreams to the reality of our human existence.&quot;\r\n\r\nThe MP3s were captured directly from the KIYQ radio stream at its broadcast bitrate of 128kbps using the program streamWriter, with no re-encoding performed.  The commercials have not been removed.  All MP3s are properly tagged with the guest name and topic in the comments tag.    \r\n\r\nMy plan is to seed a new Other Side of Midnight torrent at the end of each month, containing all of the shows for that month.  \r\n\r\nIf you are planning on downloading multiple torrents, simply point each torrent to download to the top level folder above the &quot;Richard Hoagland - The Other Side of Midnight&quot; folder and the individual months will download to their own subfolders.  \r\n\r\nThe name of each torrent may appear the same in your BT client (depending on the client).  This is necessary to keep the folder structure I want as this will be a series of torrents with subfolders.  You can see which month/year a torrent is by clicking the Files tab for each torrent.  \r\n\r\n\r\nRelevant links:\r\n   <a href=\"\nhttp://theothersideofmidnight.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttp://theothersideofmidnight.com/</a>\r\n   <a href=\"\nhttp://tunein.com/radio/KIYQ-LP-1071-s249650/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttp://tunein.com/radio/KIYQ-LP-1071-s249650/</a>\r\n   <a href=\"\nhttp://www.enterprisemission.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttp://www.enterprisemission.com/</a>","last_updated":"2017-09-07T12:08:51.335Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe11b08cc081a15e7c729816830b554111b22e30","dn":"Richard Hoagland - The Other Side of Midnight - August 2017","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"fe11b08cc081a15e7c729816830b554111b22e30","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,17,176,140,192,129,161,94,124,114,152,22,131,11,85,65,17,178,46,48]},"name":"Richard Hoagland - The Other Side of Midnight - August 2017","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
