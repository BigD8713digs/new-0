Danielewski&apos;s House of Leaves, John Ajvide Lindqvist&apos;s Let the Right One In, and Shirley Jackson&apos;s The Haunting of Hill House.\r\n\r\nThe lives of the Barretts, a normal suburban New England family, are torn apart when 14-year-old Marjorie begins to display signs of acute schizophrenia.\r\n\r\nTo her parents&apos; despair, the doctors are unable to stop Marjorie&apos;s descent into madness. As their stable home devolves into a house of horrors, they reluctantly turn to a local Catholic priest for help. Father Wanderly suggests an exorcism; he believes the vulnerable teenager is the victim of demonic possession. He also contacts a production company that is eager to document the Barretts&apos; plight. With John, Marjorie&apos;s father, out of work for more than a year and the medical bills looming, the family agrees to be filmed and soon find themselves the unwitting stars of The Possession, a hit reality television show. When events in the Barrett household explode in tragedy, the show and the shocking incidents it captures become the stuff of urban legend.\r\n\r\nFifteen years later a best-selling writer interviews Marjorie&apos;s younger sister, Merry. As she recalls those long-ago events that took place when she was just eight years old, long-buried secrets and painful memories that clash with what was broadcast on television begin to surface - and a mind-bending tale of psychological horror is unleashed, raising vexing questions about memory and reality, science and religion, and the very nature of evil.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-06-03T12:08:33.983Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:e4697d8c1046ff8112ad079403978231e62467e5","dn":"A Head Full of Ghosts by Paul Tremblay EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"e4697d8c1046ff8112ad079403978231e62467e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,105,125,140,16,70,255,129,18,173,7,148,3,151,130,49,230,36,103,229]},"name":"A Head Full of Ghosts by Paul Tremblay EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
