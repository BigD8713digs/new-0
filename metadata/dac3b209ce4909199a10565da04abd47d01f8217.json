Johnstone-Blood Valley\r\n \r\n\r\nCotton Comes To DoubtfulLawmen don&apos;t last long in the town of Doubtful, Wyoming Territory. The last one quit, another ended up in a hangman&apos;s noose, and one more was backshot by the hired guns at the Circle L Ranch.But the town of Doubtful has never seen the likes of the man who&apos;s known only as Cotton, who aims to take the badge for $125 a month, save himself a nice chunk of money over the next year, and be on his way. At least, that&apos;s his plan.Problem is, Cotton has just stuck his nose in the biggest hornet&apos;s nest in the territory. Some of the new homesteaders are stringing wire, and the three large spreads in the area don&apos;t like it much. Before Cotton can say &quot;range war!&quot; a passel of hardcases are filling the air with gunsmoke and hot lead.But Cotton won&apos;t be scared off. He&apos;ll see to it that law and order come to Doubtful&#x2014;because Cotton isn&apos;t afraid of dying. And he&apos;s not afraid of killing","last_updated":"2017-04-26T09:14:28.713Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:dac3b209ce4909199a10565da04abd47d01f8217","dn":"William W.
