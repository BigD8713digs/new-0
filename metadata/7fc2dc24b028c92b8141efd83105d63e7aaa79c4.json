If you want to create advanced 3D graphics and need a helping hand to ensure you create jaw-dropping graphics quickly and easily, then Cinema 4D is the choice for you. It comes in four different flavours for everyone&#x2019;s taste.\r\nWhat&#x2019;s New in Release 20:\r\n\r\nWelcome to the Deep End\r\nCinema 4D Release 20 marks a huge leap in technology, introducing massive new frameworks that put tremendous power in your creative hands. The possibilities are endless, your creativity is unleashed &#x2013; it&#x2019;s time to jump in the deep end.\r\n\r\nNode-Based Materials\r\nFrom simple references to complex shaders, you can build extraordinary materials in a node-based overview. Complex effects created via nodes can be wrapped as assets and delivered as simple materials, with just the necessary parameters exposed. Release 20&#x2019;s node-based materials have the power to change the way you work, whether you directly create amazing shaders through nodes or simply make.\r\n\r\nMoGraph Fields\r\nUse more than just simple shapes to control effectors, deformers, weights and more. Fields will revolutionize the MoGraph feature set, making it easy to create complex effects by combining falloffs. You&#x2019;ll never use Cinema 4D the same way again.\r\n\r\nCAD Data Import\r\nSay goodbye to conversion woes &#x2013; most popular CAD formats can be imported with a simple drag-and-drop. Get the models you need, with the quality you want thanks to the robust and flexible import of STEP, Solidworks, JT, Catia and IGES files","last_updated":"2018-10-31T12:03:42.857Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:7fc2dc24b028c92b8141efd83105d63e7aaa79c4","dn":"Maxon CINEMA 4D Studio R20.030 Full   Medicine[BabuPC]","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"7fc2dc24b028c92b8141efd83105d63e7aaa79c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,194,220,36,176,40,201,43,129,65,239,216,49,5,214,62,122,170,121,196]},"name":"Maxon CINEMA 4D Studio R20.030 Full   Medicine[BabuPC]","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
