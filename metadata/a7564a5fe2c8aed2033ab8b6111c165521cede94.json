But have you ever wondered what&apos;s going on in an animal&apos;s head?\r\n\r\nFrom the leafy forest floor to the inside of a beehive, The Inner Life of Animals takes us from microscopic levels of observation to the big philosophical, ethical and scientific questions. We read the stories of a grateful humpback whale, of a hedgehog who has nightmares and of a magpie who commits adultery; we meet bees that plan for the future, pigs who learn their own names and crows that go tobogganing for fun. And at last we find out why wasps exist.\r\n\r\nAs more and more researchers are discovering, animals experience a rich emotional life that is ready to be explored. The Inner Life of Animals will show you these living things in a new light and will open up the animal kingdom like never before.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-11-23T12:03:59.095Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:a7564a5fe2c8aed2033ab8b6111c165521cede94","dn":"The Inner Life of Animals by Peter Wohlleben EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"a7564a5fe2c8aed2033ab8b6111c165521cede94","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,86,74,95,226,200,174,210,3,58,184,182,17,28,22,85,33,206,222,148]},"name":"The Inner Life of Animals by Peter Wohlleben EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
