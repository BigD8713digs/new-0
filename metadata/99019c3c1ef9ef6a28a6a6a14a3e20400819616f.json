The tour was an extension of the Keep the Faith Tour which was in promotion of the 1992 multi-platinum album Keep the Faith. The tour returned to Europe, Asia and North America.\r\nAs is normal with Bon Jovi set lists change regularly and on the second night an extra 4 song encore was played.... Bon Jovi are so consistent live that I have never seen a bad show. Old time pros in 1993 after being together a decade and coming through the aftermath of the Slippery / Jersey mammoth success\r\n\r\nTracklist Disk 1\r\n\r\n1. I Believe.mp3\r\n2.
