There are endless stories, frequent hand washing, and not enough eating. The book you hold before you is no ordinary Haggadah. For This We Left Egypt? is a hilarious and entertaining parody from the comedic minds of Dave Barry, Alan Zweibel, and Adam Mansbach. These award-winning comedy writers take you through every step of the Seder, from getting rid of all the chametz in your house by setting it on fire with a standard blowtorch (preferably outdoors), to breaking the middle matzah - that is, if you can find a piece that isn&apos;t already broken, to a hilariously absurd retelling of the Passover story featuring Pharaoh Schmuck, a burning bush that sounds kind of like Morgan Freeman, and the Promised Land which turned out not to be a land of milk and honey but rather one of rocks and venomous scorpions the size of Yorkshire terriers. Also included are useless commentary and thought-provoking discussion questions throughout such as: Is Manischewitz considered a plague? Publishing just in time for Passover, this book will be the perfect gift book from G-d that you&apos;ll want to share and laugh over with friends and family.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-07-12T12:00:37.853Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:c548965ba9cf45d6bc1a9c618d560eed9115d715","dn":"Dave Barry - For This We Left Egypt 2017 RETAiL ePUB eBOOK-DiSTR","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"c548965ba9cf45d6bc1a9c618d560eed9115d715","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,72,150,91,169,207,69,214,188,26,156,97,141,86,14,237,145,21,215,21]},"name":"Dave Barry - For This We Left Egypt 2017 RETAiL ePUB eBOOK-DiSTR","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
