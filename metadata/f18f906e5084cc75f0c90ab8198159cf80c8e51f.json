He does not remember how he got there. He has forgotten where he lives. He cannot even remember his own name.\r\n\r\nSo begins Code to Zero, Ken Follett&apos;s explosive tale of intrigue, espionage, and conspiracy. It&apos;s January 1958, a dark hour in the cold war and the early dawn of the space race. At Cape Canaveral, a countdown has begun. On launch pad 26B sits Explorer I, America&apos;s best hope to match the Soviet Sputnik and regain the lead in the contest for the skies above.\r\n\r\nAs Luke Lucas starts to unravel the mystery of his amnesia, his desperate search leads him back to his Harvard friends: to his wife, to his best friend, to the woman he once loved more than life itself...and to the rocket that stands ready at the Cape. For Luke knew something that someone deliberately wanted him to forget, and unless he is able to discover his own deadly secret, he may be left powerless to save the launch of Explorer, and with it, America&apos;s future.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-12-24T12:00:33.114Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:f18f906e5084cc75f0c90ab8198159cf80c8e51f","dn":"Code to Zero by Ken Follett EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"f18f906e5084cc75f0c90ab8198159cf80c8e51f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,143,144,110,80,132,204,117,240,201,10,184,25,129,89,207,128,200,229,31]},"name":"Code to Zero by Ken Follett EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
