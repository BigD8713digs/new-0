I wish to demonstrate that when Muslims buried the Prophet, they also buried with him many of the universal values of Islam that he had preached. The history of Islam can be described essentially as the history of an unending power struggle, where men have killed each other to claim the mantle of Muhammad. This strife is a painful story that started within hours of the Prophet closing his eyes forever, and needs to be told. I firmly believe the message of the Quran is strong enough to withstand the facts of history. It is my conviction that Muslims are mature and secure in their identities to face the truth. This is that story.\r\n&quot; Chasing a Mirage is an extremely valuable contributing to the fight by progressive Muslims against Islamist fascism. This book should be required reading for the Left in the West who have mistakenly started believing that Islamists represent some sort of anti&#x2013;imperialism.&quot; &#x2014;Farooq Tariq","last_updated":"2017-06-25T12:02:38.000Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:5eb9f9f586139ec43133743bedb44a65de65b7a7","dn":"Chasing a Mirage:The Tragic Illusion of an Islamic State - Fatah","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"5eb9f9f586139ec43133743bedb44a65de65b7a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,185,249,245,134,19,158,196,49,51,116,59,237,180,74,101,222,101,183,167]},"name":"Chasing a Mirage:The Tragic Illusion of an Islamic State - Fatah","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
