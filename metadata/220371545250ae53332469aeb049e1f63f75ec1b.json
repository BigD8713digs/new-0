If you&apos;re a cop\r\nyour job is to chase down your quarry using any means necessary, including\r\nroadblocks\r\n\r\nIf you&apos;re playing as a racer you&apos;ll often be in a slower car than your\r\npursuer, but you won&apos;t be tied to any of their rules and get your own\r\npowerful power-ups like the radar jammer\r\n\r\n1.
