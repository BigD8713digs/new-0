Viswanathan (Elsevier, 2017).pdf\r\n\r\nEnergy Sources: Fundamentals of Chemical Conversion Processes and Applications provides the latest information on energy and the environment, the two main concerns of any progressive society that hopes to be sustainable in the future. Continuous efforts have to be exercised in both these areas by any of the developing communities, as concern over energy conversion continues to evolve due to various ecological imbalances, including climate change.\r\n\r\nThis book provides the fundamentals behind all energy conversion processes, identifies future research needs, and discusses the potential application of each process in a clear-and-concise manner. It is a valuable source for both chemists and chemical engineers who are working to improve current and developing future energy sources, and is a single reference that deals with almost all energy sources for these purposes, reviewing the fundamentals, comparing the various processes, and suggesting future research directions.\r\n\r\nCompiles, in a single source, all energy conversion processes, enabling easy evaluation and selection\r\nExplains the science behind each conversion process and facilitates understanding\r\nContains many illustrations, diagrams, and tables, enabling a clear and comprehensible understanding of the pros and cons of the various processes\r\nIncludes an exhaustive glossary of all terms used in the conversion processes\r\nPresents current status and new direction, thus enabling the planning process for future research needs\r\nProvides a concise and comprehensive overview of all energy sources","last_updated":"2017-05-31T12:00:52.724Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:e91e5a7cfe2540e841596fbf51ff705c57e49cee","dn":"Energy Sources - Fundamentals of Chemical Conversion Processes a","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"e91e5a7cfe2540e841596fbf51ff705c57e49cee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,30,90,124,254,37,64,232,65,89,111,191,81,255,112,92,87,228,156,238]},"name":"Energy Sources - Fundamentals of Chemical Conversion Processes a","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
