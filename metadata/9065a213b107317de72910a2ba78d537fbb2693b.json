Set in the same universe as the first game, but with different characters and a different setting, Outlast 2 is a twisted new journey into the depths of the human mind and its dark secrets.\r\n\r\nOutlast 2 introduces you to Sullivan Knoth and his followers, who left our wicked world behind to give birth to Temple Gate, a town, deep in the wilderness and hidden from civilization. Knoth and his flock are preparing for the tribulations of the end of times and you&#x2019;re right in the thick of it.\r\nYou are Blake Langermann, a cameraman working with your wife, Lynn. The two of you are investigative journalists willing to take risks and dig deep to uncover the stories no one else will dare touch.\r\nYou&apos;re following a trail of clues that started with the seemingly impossible murder of a pregnant woman known only as Jane Doe. The investigation has lead you miles into the Arizona desert, to a darkness so deep that no one could shed light upon it, and a corruption so profound that going mad may be the only sane thing to do.\r\n\r\n\r\nMinimum system requirements - \r\n\r\nWindows: Vista / 7 / 8 / 10, (64-bit only) \r\nProcessor: Intel Core i3-530\r\nMemory: 4 GB RAM\r\nGraphics: 1GB VRAM, NVIDIA Geforce GTX 260 / ATI Radeon HD 4870\r\nDirectX: Version 10\r\nStorage: 30 GB available space\r\nSound Card: DirectX Compatible\r\n\r\nAdditional Notes: Targetting 720p @ 30 fps\r\n\r\n\r\nRecommended system requirements - \r\n\r\nWindows: Vista / 7 / 8 / 10, (64-bit only) \r\nProcessor: Intel Core i3-530\r\nMemory: 8 GB RAM\r\nGraphics: 1.5GB VRAM, NVIDIA Geforce GTX 660 / ATI Radeon HD 7850\r\nDirectX: Version 11\r\nStorage: 30 GB available space\r\nSound Card: DirectX Compatible\r\n\r\nAdditional Notes: Targetting 1080p @ 60 fps\r\n\r\n\r\n***If you like it, BUY it!***\r\n\r\n***KEEP SEEDING***","last_updated":"2017-04-26T09:06:21.681Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:9065a213b107317de72910a2ba78d537fbb2693b","dn":"Outlast II.GOG","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"9065a213b107317de72910a2ba78d537fbb2693b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,101,162,19,177,7,49,125,231,41,16,162,186,120,213,55,251,178,105,59]},"name":"Outlast II.GOG","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
