Based on extensive research experiences focused on the fundamental physics of two-phase flow, the authors present the detailed theoretical foundation of multi-phase flow thermo-fluid dynamics as they apply to a variety of scenarios, including nuclear reactor transient and accident analysis, energy systems, power generation systems and even space propulsion","last_updated":"2017-06-07T12:04:46.290Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:83f7c81b0503270312af5c3f6f918dcdf01b74bc","dn":"Thermo-fluid Dynamics of Two-Phase Flow","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"83f7c81b0503270312af5c3f6f918dcdf01b74bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,247,200,27,5,3,39,3,18,175,92,63,111,145,141,205,240,27,116,188]},"name":"Thermo-fluid Dynamics of Two-Phase Flow","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
