Out of the Deep South came a rhythm-driven fusion of blues, boogie woogie and vocal harmony played by young black pioneers like Fats Domino and Little Richard that seduced young white teens and, pre-civil rights, got black and white kids reeling and rocking together. \r\nBBC Four special three-part documentary series, Rock &apos;n&apos; Roll America, explores the roots of rock music in the USA, its subsequent explosion around the world and how the first wave of rock stars opened the door for modern pop in the decade between 1954 and 1964.\r\nThe series features exclusive interviews with a host of iconic music names including Ben E King, Chubby Checker, Ronnie Spector, Tom Jones, Pat Boone, Don Everly, Wanda Jackson, Joe Boyd, Jerry Lee Lewis and The Crickets&apos; Jerry Allison.\r\n\r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n\r\n * Video Container: mkv\r\n * Video Bitrate: 4991 kb/s\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\n * Video Resolution: 1920x1080\r\n * Frame Rate: 25 FPS\r\n * Audio Codec: AC-3\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 192 kb/s\r\n * Audio Channels: 2\r\n * Run-Time: ~58 mins / part\r\n * Number of Parts: 3\r\n * Part Size: ~2 GB / part\r\n * Source: HDTV","last_updated":"2017-12-15T12:01:03.790Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:9794eade9bdae54266d20b16d3493d51c8b099d0","dn":"BBC Rock and Roll America 1of3 Sweet Little Sixteen 1080i HDTV d","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"9794eade9bdae54266d20b16d3493d51c8b099d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,148,234,222,155,218,229,66,102,210,11,22,211,73,61,81,200,176,153,208]},"name":"BBC Rock and Roll America 1of3 Sweet Little Sixteen 1080i HDTV d","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
