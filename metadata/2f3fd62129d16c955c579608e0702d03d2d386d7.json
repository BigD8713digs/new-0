By examining this relationship in historical contexts from early modernity to the present, this volume aims to deepen current understandings of the way international legal institutions, practices, and narratives have shaped specifically imperial ideas about and structures of world governance. \r\n\r\n---\r\n <a href=\"\nhttp://dlfeb.com/book/international-law-and-empire-historical-explorations-history-and-theory-of-international-law/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttp://dlfeb.com/book/international-law-and-empire-historical-explorations-history-and-theory-of-international-law/</a>","last_updated":"2017-07-23T12:01:09.154Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f3fd62129d16c955c579608e0702d03d2d386d7","dn":"INTERNATIONAL LAW AND EMPIRE: HISTORICAL EXPLORATIONS","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"2f3fd62129d16c955c579608e0702d03d2d386d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,63,214,33,41,209,108,149,92,87,150,8,224,112,45,3,210,211,134,215]},"name":"INTERNATIONAL LAW AND EMPIRE: HISTORICAL EXPLORATIONS","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
