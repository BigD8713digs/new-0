In this thought-provoking work, author Kevin O&apos;Neill examines America&apos;s concept of afterlife--as imagined in cyberspace--and considers how technologies designed to emulate immortality present serious challenges to our ideas about human identity and to our religious beliefs about heaven and hell. \r\n\r\nThe first part of the work--covering the period between 1840 and 1860--addresses post-mortem photography, cemetery design, and spiritualism. The second section discusses Internet afterlife, including online memorials and cemeteries; social media legacy pages; and sites that curate passwords, bequests, and final requests. The work concludes with chapters on the transhumanist movement, the philosophical and religious debates about Internet immortality, and the study of technologies attempting to extend life long after the human form ceases.\r\n\r\nGenre: Non-Fiction &gt; General","last_updated":"2018-09-21T12:28:35.855Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6157bf91c82341fda22cf814d18ef9daa244018","dn":" Internet Afterlife by Kevin O'neill  (.epub)(.azw3)(.pdf)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"d6157bf91c82341fda22cf814d18ef9daa244018","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,21,123,249,28,130,52,31,218,34,207,129,77,24,239,157,170,36,64,24]},"name":" Internet Afterlife by Kevin O'neill  (.epub)(.azw3)(.pdf)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
