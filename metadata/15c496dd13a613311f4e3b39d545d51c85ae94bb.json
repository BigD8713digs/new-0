But in most cases, it&apos;s a calamity.\r\n\r\nShows like Bravo&apos;s Girlfriends&apos; Guide to Divorce and HBO&apos;s Divorce normalize the dissolution of marriage, making couples feel that divorce can be a happy new beginning.\r\n\r\nCelebrities suggest a norm that divorce is not only acceptable but advisable. Gwyneth Paltrow&apos;s &quot;conscious uncoupling&quot; makes divorce seem trendy and enlightened.\r\n\r\nToday, couples are even throwing &quot;divorce parties&quot;-complete with invitations and caterers!\r\n\r\nEnough, says psychologist Diane Medved. If you&apos;re hurtling down the road to divorce, the first thing to do is to put on the brakes. Don&apos;t let your spouse, your friends, or the &quot;divorce industry&quot; rush you into ending your marriage.\r\n\r\nTake a deep breath and read this book. Drawing on three decades of clinical and personal experience, Dr. Medved will show why you should save-and revitalize-your marriage.\r\n\r\nShe expertly unmasks the threats to marriage, including hookup apps that promise non-committal sex, and legions of professionals who are financially invested in your divorce.\r\n\r\nShe punctures one-by-one the arguments in favor of divorce, proving that &quot;the good divorce&quot; is a myth.\r\n\r\nDon&apos;t Divorce is the antidote to a pro-divorce culture, the tool that will empower you to revive a dying marriage and recover the happiness that seems out of reach.\r\n\r\nDiane Medved, Ph.D. is a clinical psychologist, author of five major non-fiction books, blogger, and nationally-known speaker and media personality. Dr. Medved blogs on her own site, &#x201C;Searching for Bright Light.&#x201D;","last_updated":"2017-09-05T12:07:10.711Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:15c496dd13a613311f4e3b39d545d51c85ae94bb","dn":"Don't Divorce: Powerful Arguments for Saving and Revitalizing Yo","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"15c496dd13a613311f4e3b39d545d51c85ae94bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,196,150,221,19,166,19,49,31,78,59,57,213,69,213,28,133,174,148,187]},"name":"Don't Divorce: Powerful Arguments for Saving and Revitalizing Yo","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
