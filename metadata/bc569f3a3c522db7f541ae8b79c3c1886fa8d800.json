The game features the original zelda title in a 2.5D voxel form, giving it a fresh look. It was unfinished at the time when Nintendo put out a DMCA takedown request towards the creator hosting the files, but still has some dungeons and a bit of playability. It can be found online for browser play in some places, but this torrent gives the version that is available to play offline and off browser, in it&apos;s own application.\r\n\r\nConsider supporting the creato on other projects by following the links here &gt;&gt;https://www.zelda30tribute.com/\r\nAlso please consider seeding it for others.
