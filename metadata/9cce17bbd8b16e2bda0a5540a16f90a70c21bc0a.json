Mascis at his own game), but over the next dozen years they matured into a considerably more dynamic and intelligent band, capable of generating crunching rockers or acoustic ballads with equal precision, all of which possessed heart, soul, and a compassionate intelligence. \r\nAsides from Buffalo Tom compiles most of the band&apos;s best-known songs, including the top sides of their singles, radio emphasis tracks, a few fan favorites, and a cover of the Jam&apos;s &quot;Going Underground&quot; from a 1999 tribute album. While the album isn&apos;t sequenced chronologically, which would have made a greater case for their growth over time, it does a superb job of capturing the many sides of their musical personality, and it is both a fine summation of their first 11 years as a recording act and great introduction to one of the better bands to rise from the alt-rock scene in the 1990s. \r\nAsides from Buffalo Tom also features excellent and enlightening liner notes from the three members of the band, Bill Janovitz, Chris Colbourn, and Tom Maginnis.
