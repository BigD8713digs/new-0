Zapruder argues that the way we have been taught to read poetry is the very thing that prevents us from enjoying it.\r\n\r\n In lively, lilting prose, he shows us how that misunderstanding interferes with our direct experience of poetry and creates the sense of confusion or inadequacy that many of us feel when faced with it.   \r\n\r\nZapruder explores what poems are, and how we can read them, so that we can, as Whitman wrote, &#x201C;possess the origin of all poems,&#x201D; without the aid of any teacher or expert. \r\n\r\nMost important, he asks how reading poetry can help us to lead our lives with greater meaning and purpose. \r\n\r\nAnchored in poetic analysis and steered through Zapruder&#x2019;s personal experience of coming to the form, Why Poetry is engaging and conversational, even as it makes a passionate argument for the necessity of poetry in an age when information is constantly being mistaken for knowledge.\r\n\r\n While he provides a simple reading method for approaching poems and illuminates concepts like associative movement, metaphor, and negative capability, Zapruder explicitly confronts the obstacles that readers face when they encounter poetry to show us that poetry can be read, and enjoyed, by anyone.\r\n\r\n\r\nZapruder is the author of several collections of poetry, including Sun Bear (2014), Come On All You Ghosts (2010), The Pajamaist (2006), and American Linden (2002)","last_updated":"2017-09-03T12:03:18.862Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:5cd088d888cef2855955590edc06f3640eec5411","dn":"Why Poetry/Matthew Zapruder/2017/EPUB/","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"5cd088d888cef2855955590edc06f3640eec5411","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,208,136,216,136,206,242,133,89,85,89,14,220,6,243,100,14,236,84,17]},"name":"Why Poetry/Matthew Zapruder/2017/EPUB/","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
