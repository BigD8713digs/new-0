NTM .\r\nSo I did the tagging and numbering ect. Editing and I added the 3rd disk as a bonus and to kinda bring it up to semi current but since no one else really shares what I do I find it to be relevant and timely and it kicks ass(the important part).\r\n\r\nI have slowed my roll as Im sure at leat 1 or 2 of ya out there may have noticed and Im really close to shutting it down. Im sick of numbers whores and uploaders who dont care about the share only the numbers. If you dont love it dont up it. And other shit that I deal with, equipment, trolls,sites going under, peeps leaving,The real worlds shit ugh. It all adds up, But enough heres why Im here now...\r\n\r\nTracklist Disk 1  \r\n\r\n01  Fear and Fury.mp3\r\n02  The Soulless.mp3\r\n03  Maximum Carnage.mp3\r\n04  Winter&apos;s Gate, Pt. 4.mp3\r\n05  Outlaws.mp3\r\n06  The Beast Is Rising.mp3\r\n07  The Dreamthieves (Acoustic).mp3\r\n08  Reaction.mp3\r\n09  Fear.mp3\r\n10  Out of the Rain.mp3\r\n11  This World.mp3\r\n12  The Stage.mp3\r\n13  Redemption (Live).mp3\r\n14  Remove Your Doubt.mp3\r\n15  Young Graves.mp3\r\n16  Hold On For Dear Life.mp3\r\n17  Murder Capital.mp3\r\n\r\nDisk 2\r\n\r\n18  Don&apos;t Comfort Me.mp3\r\n19  I Live Again.mp3\r\n20  Thy Will Be Done.mp3\r\n21  Nowhere To Hide.mp3\r\n22  Hold On.mp3\r\n23  Walls.mp3\r\n24  Storyline.mp3\r\n25  It Remembers.mp3\r\n26  Rock Will Never Die.mp3\r\n27  Tears In The Ocean.mp3\r\n28  Living In The Shadow Of Yesterday.mp3\r\n29  Prophecy.mp3\r\n30  Night Wing.mp3\r\n31  Nightmare.mp3\r\n32  Taking on the World.mp3\r\n33  STill Dying To Live.mp3\r\n34  Blood Colored (Edge Of Sanity Cover).mp3\r\n35  Last Illusion.mp3\r\n\r\nDisk 3 (Bonus made July 7th 2017)\r\n\r\n01  The Way You Used To Do.mp3\r\n02  Back Off.mp3\r\n03  Carry on Wayward Son.mp3\r\n04  Revolution.mp3\r\n05  The Cornfields Queen Brotherhood.mp3\r\n06  Shooting Angels.mp3\r\n07  Brick by Brick.mp3\r\n08  The Slippery Slope (Hangman&apos;s Rope).mp3\r\n09  Ghost Warriors.mp3\r\n10  Days They Come.mp3\r\n11  Voices Unheard.mp3\r\n12  From Here to Hell.mp3\r\n13  Three Times Thunder Strikes.mp3\r\n14  Silent Majority.mp3\r\n15  Wrong One to Fuck With.mp3\r\n16  Into the Fire.mp3\r\n17  Where The Sun Is Silent.mp3\r\n18  We Dont Rock Alone.mp3\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat was once lost now is found but Lost may become LAST.
