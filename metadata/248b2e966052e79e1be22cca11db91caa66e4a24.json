Whether it&apos;s with love and dating, career and ambition, friends, or gossip, Naya inspires us to follow our own destiny and step over - or plod through - all the crap along the way.\r\n\r\nAfter her rise and fall from childhood stardom on The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air and Family Matters, barely eking her way through high school, a brief stint as a Hooters waitress, going through thick and thin with her mom/manager, and resurrecting her acting career as Santana Lopez on Glee, Naya emerged from these experiences with some key life lessons. Even with a successful career and a family that she loves more than anything else, Naya says, &quot;There&apos;s still a 13-year-old girl inside of me making detailed lists of how I can improve, who&apos;s never sure of my own self-worth.&quot; Sorry Not Sorry is for that 13-year-old in all of us.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-11-25T12:59:30.245Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:248b2e966052e79e1be22cca11db91caa66e4a24","dn":"Sorry Not Sorry by Naya Rivera EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"248b2e966052e79e1be22cca11db91caa66e4a24","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,139,46,150,96,82,231,158,27,226,44,202,17,219,145,202,166,110,74,36]},"name":"Sorry Not Sorry by Naya Rivera EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
