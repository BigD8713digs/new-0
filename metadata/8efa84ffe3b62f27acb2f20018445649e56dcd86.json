As a young journalist, Neil Gaiman was given complete access to Adams&#x2019;s life, times, gossip, unpublished outtakes, and files (and became privy to his writing process, insecurities, disillusionments, challenges, and triumphs). The resulting volume illuminates the unique, funny, dramatic, and improbable chronicle of an idea, an incredibly tall man, and a mind-boggling success story.\r\n\r\nGenre: Non-Fiction &gt; Biographies &amp; Memoirs","last_updated":"2018-10-31T12:06:18.595Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:8efa84ffe3b62f27acb2f20018445649e56dcd86","dn":"Don't Panic by Neil Gaiman (.epub)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"8efa84ffe3b62f27acb2f20018445649e56dcd86","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,250,132,255,227,182,47,39,172,178,242,0,24,68,86,73,229,109,205,134]},"name":"Don't Panic by Neil Gaiman (.epub)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
