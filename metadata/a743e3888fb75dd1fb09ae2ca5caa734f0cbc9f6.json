Birnes EPUB\r\n\r\nThe best-selling expos&#xE9; that ends the decades-old controversy surrounding the infamous and mysterious crash of an unidentified aircraft at Roswell, New Mexico, in 1947.\r\n\r\nBacked by documents declassified through the Freedom of Information Act, Colonel Philip J. Corso (Ret.), a member of President Eisenhower&apos;s National Security Council and former head of the Foreign Technology Desk in the US Army, has come forward to reveal his personal stewardship of alien artifacts from the Roswell crash. He tells us how he spearheaded the army&apos;s reverse-engineering project that led to today&apos;s integrated circuit chips, fiber optics, lasers, and super-tenacity fibers and &quot;seeded&quot; the Roswell alien technology to giants of American industry. Laying bare the US government&apos;s shocking role in the Roswell incident - what was found, the cover-up, and how they used alien artifacts to change the course of 20th-century history - The Day After Roswell is an extraordinary memoir that forces us to reconsider not only the past but also our role in the universe.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-06-16T12:02:41.732Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:a743e3888fb75dd1fb09ae2ca5caa734f0cbc9f6","dn":"The Day After Roswell by Philip Corso, William J.
