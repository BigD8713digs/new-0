In case of encryption of the system or boot partition, BestCrypt Volume will not allow the system to boot without entering the required password. The program uses encryption mode for XTS disks and modern and cryptographic-proven advanced and high-speed encryption algorithms with a maximum key. In addition to entering the password as the most vulnerable place, the program offers the use of hardware USB keys as a high-secret encryption key store. With the hardware USB keys, the user obtains two levels of encrypted data protection, since, together with entering the password, it is necessary to connect a small hardware USB device to the computer where the encryption key is stored. Encryption algorithms supported by the program: AES 256-bit, Blowfish 448-bit, CAST 128-bit, GOST 256-bit, RC6 256-bit, Serpent 256-bit, Twofish 256-bit","last_updated":"2017-08-23T12:01:16.759Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b120b021c2b226f097af61c1bed49498f7f718e","dn":"Jetico BestCrypt 9.03.4 RePack","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"8b120b021c2b226f097af61c1bed49498f7f718e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,18,11,2,28,43,34,111,9,122,246,28,27,237,73,73,143,127,113,142]},"name":"Jetico BestCrypt 9.03.4 RePack","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
