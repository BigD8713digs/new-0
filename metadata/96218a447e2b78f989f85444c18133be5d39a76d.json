Harvard Business School professor Deepak Malhorta uses a fable involving a different set of mice in a maze&#x2014;mice who question everything&#x2014;to help readers see how they underestimate their ability change the rules, overcome the constraints they face, and control their own destiny. I Moved Your Cheese encourages readers to audit their assumptions about what limitations they really face and which are self-imposed or unthinkingly accepted. We can create the circumstances and realities we want&#x2014;we can go beyond simply changing our behavior (find that new cheese!) to changing the game itself. But to do so we need to understand the ways we&#x2019;re holding ourselves back. As one of the characters in the book says, &#x201C;the problem is not that the mouse is in the maze, but that the maze is in the mouse.&#x201D;","last_updated":"2017-07-02T12:00:43.890Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:96218a447e2b78f989f85444c18133be5d39a76d","dn":"Deepak Malhotra - I Moved Your Cheese For Those Who Refuse to Li","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"96218a447e2b78f989f85444c18133be5d39a76d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,33,138,68,126,43,120,249,137,248,84,68,193,129,51,190,93,57,167,109]},"name":"Deepak Malhotra - I Moved Your Cheese For Those Who Refuse to Li","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
