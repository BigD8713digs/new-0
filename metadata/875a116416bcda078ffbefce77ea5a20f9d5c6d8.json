Gioia has published five volumes of poetry, served as the Chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts, and currently sits as the Poet Laureate of California, but he is also a graduate of Stanford Business School and was once a Vice President at General Foods. He has studied opera and is a published librettist, in addition to his prolific work in critical essay writing and editing literary anthologies. Having lived several lives, Gioia brings an insightful, varied, eclectic eye to this year&#x2019;s Best American Poetry.\r\n\r\nWith his classic essay &#x201C;Can Poetry Matter?&#x201D;, originally run in The Atlantic in 1991, Gioia considered whether there is a place for poetry to be a part of modern American mainstream culture. Decades later, the debate continues, but Best American Poetry 2018 stands as evidence that poetry is very much present, relevant, and finding new readers.\r\n\r\nGenre: Fiction &gt; General Fiction/Classics","last_updated":"2018-10-06T12:19:50.714Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:875a116416bcda078ffbefce77ea5a20f9d5c6d8","dn":"Best American Poetry 2018 by Dana Gioia, David Lehman (.epub)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"875a116416bcda078ffbefce77ea5a20f9d5c6d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,90,17,100,22,188,218,7,143,251,239,206,119,234,90,32,249,213,198,216]},"name":"Best American Poetry 2018 by Dana Gioia, David Lehman (.epub)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
