Tellingly a track such as &#x201C;Moorkolk&#x201D;, where Brand sequences parts that could come from a multi cello sonata and Rupp scratches and scampers with withdrawn pressure, proves the duo&#x2019;s capability to improvise at the slowest possible tempo. Defining tracks such as &#x201C;Labeling Approach&#x201D; and &#x201C;Quellnoor&#x201D; demonstrate the exact opposite. Soon after Brand&#x2019;s Paganini-styled spiccato creates a vivid exposition on the first tune, Rupp&#x2019;s knob twisting reveals a thumping ostinato that resembles cymbal crashes. Off-handed picking and string buzzing from the cellist is then lubricated by rubs and tugs by the guitarist leading to rugged below-the-bridge responses from Brand and eventually multiphonic flanges from Rupp. All this, plus maintaining the theme on top of the cellist&#x2019;s shifting continuum. Any attempts at long-string romanticism on &#x201C;Quellnoor&#x201D; are quickly subverted by interjections from Rupp that move rocket-like. Moving forward and back like square dancers, the two continuously change places, with scrubs and plucks from Brand meeting string twangs or barks from Rupp. Often separated by protracted silences, Rupp sneaks in the odd rock riff and Brand adds some passages that would be elegant if not so high-pitched and strained. Chamber music with a difference these improvisations show what conventional instruments are capable of when utilized to their limits. - Ken Waxman, JazzWord","last_updated":"2017-08-27T12:07:48.431Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:a752c3dba83588dd45cd0549e4c39b2cdf1ec430","dn":"Ulrike Brand &amp; Olaf Rupp 2016 Shadowscores","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"a752c3dba83588dd45cd0549e4c39b2cdf1ec430","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,82,195,219,168,53,136,221,69,205,5,73,228,195,155,44,223,30,196,48]},"name":"Ulrike Brand &amp; Olaf Rupp 2016 Shadowscores","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
