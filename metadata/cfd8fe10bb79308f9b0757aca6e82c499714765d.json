In this accessible work of brilliant scholarship, Alison Weir draws on early biographies, letters, memoirs, account books, and diplomatic reports to bring these women to life.\r\n\r\nCatherine of Aragon emerges as a staunch though misguided woman of principle; Anne Boleyn, an ambitious adventuress with a penchant for vengeance; Jane Seymour, a strong-minded matriarch in the making; Anne of Cleves, a good-natured and innocent woman naively unaware of the court intrigues that determined her fate; Catherine Howard, an empty-headed wanton; and Catherine Parr, a warm-blooded bluestocking who survived King Henry to marry a fourth time.\r\n\r\nGenre: Non-Fiction &gt; Biographies &amp; Memoirs","last_updated":"2018-12-07T12:21:32.006Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:cfd8fe10bb79308f9b0757aca6e82c499714765d","dn":"The Six Wives of Henry VIII by Alison Weir (.ePUB) ","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"cfd8fe10bb79308f9b0757aca6e82c499714765d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,216,254,16,187,121,48,143,155,7,87,172,166,232,44,73,151,20,118,93]},"name":"The Six Wives of Henry VIII by Alison Weir (.ePUB) ","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
