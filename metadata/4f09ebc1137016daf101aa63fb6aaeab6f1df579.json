The universe of the beehive is an intricately organised, delicately balanced ecosystem. From the mighty queen to the lowliest worker bees, each bee plays its part in the whole. \r\nThe Honey Factory plunges the reader into the invisible life of a bee colony and reveals the secrets of this fascinating world. How do worker bees come to a collective decision? What does the honeybees&#x2019; waggling dance communicate? What provokes the sexual excesses of the young queen bee? And why is the precious relationship between humans and bees a matter of species survival? \r\nCombining the most fascinating scientific discoveries and greatest secrets in bee research, The Honey Factory answers these questions and more.\r\n\r\nGenre: Non-Fiction &gt; Educational","last_updated":"2018-09-11T12:17:02.366Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f09ebc1137016daf101aa63fb6aaeab6f1df579","dn":"The Honey Factory by Jurgen Tauz, Diedrich Steen (.epub)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"4f09ebc1137016daf101aa63fb6aaeab6f1df579","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,9,235,193,19,112,22,218,241,1,170,99,251,106,174,171,111,29,245,121]},"name":"The Honey Factory by Jurgen Tauz, Diedrich Steen (.epub)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
