The underlying principle of this design is to give students the opportunity to practice statistics while they learn statistics. The text accomplishes this through the inclusion of relevant clinical examples followed by end of chapter application exercises.\r\nThe Third Edition has been updated with practice activities which enable students to apply the content they have learned. In addition, the authors have included new research articles to develop and reinforce literature critiquing skills. These new features provide more opportunities for students to apply the concepts learned while the explanations are beneficial to clinical experts interested in further developing evidence-based skills.\r\nThis text meets the needs of both undergraduate nursing research students who need to learn how to critically analyze literature as well as graduate DNP students who must also be familiar with statistics for nursing in accordance with the rigor of the DNP program.\r\n\r\nNew to the 3rd Ed: Additional review questions, New and updated graphs and figures, Updated lesson content for computer application exercises\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\nIntroduction ix\r\nAcknowledgments xi\r\nChapter 1: Introduction to Statistics and Levels of Measurement 1\r\nChapter 2: Presenting Data 19\r\nChapter 3: Descriptive Statistics, Probability, and Measures of Central Tendency 41\r\nChapter 4: Measuring Data 63\r\nChapter 5: Sampling Methods 83 Sampling Methods 84\r\nChapter 6: Generating the Research Idea 99\r\nChapter 7: Sample Size, Effect Size, and Power 113\r\nChapter 8: Chi-Square 127\r\nChapter 9: Student t-Test 145\r\nChapter 10: Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) 171\r\nChapter 11: Correlation Coefficients 191\r\nCHAPTER 12: Regression Analysis 207\r\nChapter 13: Relative Risk, Odds Ratio, and Attributable Risk 249\r\nAppendix A: Tables for Reference 277\r\nAppendix B: Working with Small Samples 287\r\nReferences 291\r\nEpilogue 295\r\nIndex 297\r\n <a href=\"\nhttps://s7.postimg.cc/5lxssc5wb/Statistics_for_Nursing_-_A_Practical_Approach_3rd_Ed.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://s7.postimg.cc/5lxssc5wb/Statistics_for_Nursing_-_A_Practical_Approach_3rd_Ed.jpg</a>","last_updated":"2018-04-17T17:42:52.056Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:c05c1b5fd22305099ad926b2afdcd9ded939d1fa","dn":"Statistics for Nursing  -A Practical Approach (3rd Ed)(gnv64)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"c05c1b5fd22305099ad926b2afdcd9ded939d1fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,92,27,95,210,35,5,9,154,217,38,178,175,220,217,222,217,57,209,250]},"name":"Statistics for Nursing  -A Practical Approach (3rd Ed)(gnv64)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
