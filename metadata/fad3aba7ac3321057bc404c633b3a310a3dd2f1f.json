What motivated Manson in his seemingly mindless selection of victims, and what was his hold over the young women who obeyed his orders? Here is the gripping story of this famous and haunting crime. 50 pages of b/w photographs.\r\n\r\nBoth Helter Skelter and Vincent Bugliosi&#x2019;s subsequent Till Death Us Do Part won Edgar Allan Poe Awards for best true-crime book of the year. Bugliosi is also the author of Outrage: The Five Reasons Why O. J. Simpson Got Away with Murder (Norton, 1996) and other books. Curt Gentry, an Edgar winner, is the author of J. Edgar Hoover: The Man and the Secrets (available in Norton paperback) and Frame-Up: The Incredible Case of Tom Mooney and Warren Billings","last_updated":"2017-07-23T12:01:01.404Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:fad3aba7ac3321057bc404c633b3a310a3dd2f1f","dn":"Helter Skelter: The True Story of the Manson Murders","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"fad3aba7ac3321057bc404c633b3a310a3dd2f1f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,211,171,167,172,51,33,5,123,196,4,198,51,179,163,16,163,221,47,31]},"name":"Helter Skelter: The True Story of the Manson Murders","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
