The 1966-68 NBC show was a fast-paced farce interspersed with musical &quot;romps&quot; featuring the band&apos;s catchy tunes written by professional songwriters. Despite the show lasting just two seasons, the Monkees became a real recording, touring group and are remembered as iconic pop-culture figures of the 1960s.\r\n(TVDB)\r\n\r\nTwo Seasons, 67 files: 58 episodes, 9 specials (including &quot;33 1/3 Revolutions Per Monkee&quot;).\r\n\r\n- Ripped from DVD9 with Handbrake 1.1.2.\r\n\r\nVideo/Audio quality indistinguishable from the original DVD at 1/3 the original size.\r\n\r\nContainer   : Matroska Multimedia Container (.mkv)\r\nVideo       : 720x480 at 23.976 fps (NTSC 4:3 aspect ratio) 45 episodes\r\n            : 720x480 at 29.970 fps (NTSC 4:3 aspect ratio) 13 episodes\r\nFormat      : H.265 10bit (CFR 18RF &quot;Slow&quot;)\r\nBitrate     : Varies 1000-2000 kb/s\r\nAudio       : English, 448 kb/s, 48.0 kHz, 16 bit, 6 channels, AC-3\r\nSubs        : None\r\n\r\nFile Size   : Approximately 350 MB per episode.
