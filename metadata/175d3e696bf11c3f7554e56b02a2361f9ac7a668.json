Now, the master of hacks, Dan Marshall provides tricks, shortcuts, and ideas to help de-clutter and solve everyday annoyances.\r\n\r\n&quot;Life hacking refers to any trick, shortcut, skill, or novelty method that increases productivity and efficiency,&quot; he explains. &quot;In other words, anything that solves an everyday problem in an inspired, ingenious matter.&quot; In Tidy Hacks he shares inventive ways to reuse, recycle, and reclaim your tidy home.\r\n\r\nDon&apos;t throw away those breakfast grapefruit halves--add a little salt and use them to clean your oven. Is space tight in the bathroom? Use hanging tiered fruit and vegetable baskets from the shower rod to stow shower toys and shampoo. Are your shoes looking a little dull and scuffed? Rub the pithy side of a banana skin over the scuffed leather. Instead of tossing that elastic band into a drawer, wrap it from shoulder to shoulder around a hanger to keep your clothes from slipping to the closet floor.
