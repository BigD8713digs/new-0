Finding these forays both puzzling and exhilarating, Robb dug deeper into the science of dreams at an extremely opportune moment: just as researchers began to understand why dreams exist. They aren&#x2019;t just random events; they have clear purposes. They help us learn and even overcome psychic trauma.\r\n\r\nRobb draws on fresh and forgotten research, as well as her experience and that of other dream experts, to show why dreams are vital to our emotional and physical health. She explains how we can remember our dreams better&#x2014;and why we should. She traces the intricate links between dreaming and creativity, and even offers advice on how we can relish the intense adventure of lucid dreaming for ourselves.\r\n\r\nWhy We Dream is a clear-eyed, cutting-edge examination of the meaning and purpose of our nightly visions and a guide to changing our dream lives&#x2014;and making our waking lives richer, healthier, and happier.\r\n\r\nGenre: Non-Fiction &gt; Educational","last_updated":"2018-11-21T12:18:44.307Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:490c24865c498d3fdc6cfa60b1bd63b3f3d1e998","dn":"Why We Dream by Alice Robb (.epub)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"490c24865c498d3fdc6cfa60b1bd63b3f3d1e998","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,12,36,134,92,73,141,63,220,108,250,96,177,189,99,179,243,209,233,152]},"name":"Why We Dream by Alice Robb (.epub)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
