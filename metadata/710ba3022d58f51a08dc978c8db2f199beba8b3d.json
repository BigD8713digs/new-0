This iconic muscle car was the vehicle McQueen drove in his most raucous and enduring film, Bullitt.\r\n\r\nIn the 1960s, McQueen was, according to box office receipts, the biggest movie star of his generation and one of the coolest men to ever walk the planet. Greg Laurie was a teen at the time and an ardent fan of &quot;The King of Cool,&quot; first mesmerized by McQueen in 1963&apos;s The Great Escape. Like millions of cinema fans, Greg developed a lifelong fascination with the actor. Now he has a chance to tell McQueen&apos;s story.\r\n\r\nMcQueen was a complex, contradictory man who lived the same way he drove his motorcycles and cars: fearlessly, ruthlessly and at top speed. After a lifetime of fast cars, women and drugs, McQueen took a surprising detour.\r\n\r\nIn this book, Laurie thoughtfully interviews members of Steve McQueen&apos;s family, friends, co-stars, associates, widow and pastor to tell of the dramatic life-change for the actor in the spring of 1979 - six months before McQueen was diagnosed with terminal cancer","last_updated":"2017-07-24T12:01:21.852Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:710ba3022d58f51a08dc978c8db2f199beba8b3d","dn":"Steve McQueen The Salvation of an American Icon(2017) - EPUB - z","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"710ba3022d58f51a08dc978c8db2f199beba8b3d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,11,163,2,45,88,245,26,8,220,151,140,141,178,241,153,190,186,139,61]},"name":"Steve McQueen The Salvation of an American Icon(2017) - EPUB - z","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
