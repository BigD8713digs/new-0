Lee EPUB\r\n\r\nWelcome to Eternal Springs, home to more than a 1,000 &#x201C;normal&#x201D; people and four feisty witches. Just a tip, the witches are more fun.\r\n\r\nEspecially Skye Thornton, an air witch about town who would rather be on the mainland than a touristy island that&#x2019;s home to four climate zones and a gaping hole under the local school that allows monsters to creep through and wreak havoc on the community.\r\n\r\nA reporter, Skye likes to be in the thick of things - she&#x2019;s a busybody and proud of it - until she quite literally trips over a dead body at the island resort. In quick order, she finds herself fighting off monsters while trying to discover one of the human variety.\r\n\r\nSince she can&#x2019;t keep clear of trouble, Skye is determined to track down a murderer, fight off a wishing well beast, and stay away from a local security chief who she&#x2019;s always hated&#x2026; or has she?\r\n\r\nIt&#x2019;s a full slate of activity for Skye and her witchy friends. The laughs and insults will be flying fast and furious. Of course, so will the danger.\r\n\r\nLook out world, here come four witches with attitude, and they&#x2019;re not taking any prisoners.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-07-11T12:02:13.805Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f48244f7f0fdff0aeaaec13a4e8148a3892208f","dn":"Bat out of Spell by Amanda M.
