Evans epub/mobi\r\n\r\nModern historical study of the Gospels seems to give us a new portrait of Jesus every spring--just in time for Easter. The more unusual the portrait, the more it departs from the traditional view of Jesus, the more attention it gets in the popular media. Why are scholars so prone to fabricate a new Jesus? Why is the public so eager to accept such claims without question? What methods and assumptions predispose scholars to distort the record? Is there a more sober approach to finding the real Jesus? Commenting on such recent releases as Bart Ehrman&apos;s Misquoting Jesus, James Tabor&apos;s The Jesus Dynasty, Michael Baigent&apos;s The Jesus Papers and the Gospel of Judas, for which he served as an advisory board member to the National Geographic Society, Craig Evans offers a sane approach to examining the sources for understanding the historical Jesus.\r\n\r\nPlease seed.  Thanks!","last_updated":"2017-06-03T12:05:24.327Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf9e834507c6226c352457ce55d7a1e587f91f87","dn":"Fabricating Jesus: How Modern Scholars Distort the Gospels - ","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"bf9e834507c6226c352457ce55d7a1e587f91f87","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,158,131,69,7,198,34,108,53,36,87,206,85,215,161,229,135,249,31,135]},"name":"Fabricating Jesus: How Modern Scholars Distort the Gospels - ","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
