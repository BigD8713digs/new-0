Scott Galloway explains that this excellent album was recorded under less-than-ideal circumstances. The Average White Band&apos;s original drummer, Robbie McIntosh, died of a heroin overdose in 1974, and the surviving members were still in mourning when they started working on their third album, Cut the Cake (which originally came out on LP in 1975). Steve Ferrone, a black drummer from London, England, was hired as a replacement -- ironically, he became the first black member of a Scottish soul/funk band that had a very African-American sound and a largely African-American following. Despite the fact that AWB&apos;s members still had McIntosh&apos;s death on their minds when they were writing and recording Cut the Cake, this isn&apos;t a depressing or consistently melancholy album; far from it. In fact, parts of the album are downright fun, especially up-tempo funk gems like &quot;School Boy Crush,&quot; &quot;Groovin&apos; the Night Away&quot; and the hit title song (which made it to number seven on Billboard&apos;s R&amp;B singles chart)...   - Alex Henderson, AMG","last_updated":"2017-07-30T12:04:10.043Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b8c7e8758ddae9a749cca6f40172141ba8c2523","dn":"Average White Band 1975 Cut The Cake (vinyl)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"2b8c7e8758ddae9a749cca6f40172141ba8c2523","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,140,126,135,88,221,174,154,116,156,202,111,64,23,33,65,186,140,37,35]},"name":"Average White Band 1975 Cut The Cake (vinyl)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
