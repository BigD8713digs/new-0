You&#x2019;ll learn how to write and run tests before building each part of your app, and then develop the minimum amount of code required to pass those tests. The result? Clean code that works.\r\n\r\nAuthor Harry J.W. Percival uses a concrete example&#x2014;the development of a web site, from scratch&#x2014;to teach TDD methodology and how it applies to web programming, from the basics of database integration and Javascript to more advanced topics such as mocking, Ajax, and REST APIs. It&apos;s ideal for relative newcomers and self-taught web developers looking to take their skills to the next level with a more structured approach","last_updated":"2017-07-03T12:01:04.142Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:05fa5cea5825495b3aa45caf317612941033803f","dn":"Test-Driven Development with Python, 2nd Edition by Harry J.
