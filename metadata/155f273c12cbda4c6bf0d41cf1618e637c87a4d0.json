She never came home....\r\n\r\nWhen five-year-old Ava Sawyer goes missing from a birthday party at a local garden center, the police are bewildered by the lack of leads. That is, until two years later, when Ava&#x2019;s body is found and another little girl, Audrey Briggs, goes missing. Audrey also attended that party....\r\n\r\nLeading the investigation is Detective Natalie Ward. A mother of two teenagers, this case chills her to the bone and is a disturbing reminder of the last job she worked on. One that still keeps her awake at night....\r\n\r\nNatalie soon discovers that Ava&#x2019;s mother has some worrying gaps in her alibi, and as she digs deeper, she&#x2019;s sure Ava&#x2019;s father is not telling the full story. And what did the owner of the garden center Elsa see that day? Something that she&#x2019;s not telling Natalie....\r\n\r\nJust as Natalie is facing up to the grim possibility that Ava and Audrey were killed by someone close to home, another little girl from the party doesn&#x2019;t come home from her ballet lesson. Can Natalie find a way to stop this killer before more innocent lives are taken?\r\n\r\nGripping, fast-paced, and nail-bitingly tense, this book will keep you reading long into the night. Perfect for fans of Angela Marsons, Rachel Abbott, and Karin Slaughter.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-09-27T12:02:23.584Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:155f273c12cbda4c6bf0d41cf1618e637c87a4d0","dn":"The Birthday (Detective Natalie Ward, Book 1) by Carol Wyer EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"155f273c12cbda4c6bf0d41cf1618e637c87a4d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,95,39,60,18,203,218,76,107,240,212,28,241,97,142,99,124,135,164,208]},"name":"The Birthday (Detective Natalie Ward, Book 1) by Carol Wyer EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
