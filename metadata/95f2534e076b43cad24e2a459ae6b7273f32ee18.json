He&apos;s even been knighted for his services to journalism. In Do I Make Myself Clear?, he brings his indispensable insight to us all in his definite guide to writing well.\r\n\r\nThe right words are oxygen to our ideas, but the digital era, with all of its TTYL, LMK, and WTF, has been cutting off that oxygen flow. The compulsion to be precise has vanished from our culture, and in writing of every kind we see a trend toward more - more speed and more information but far less clarity.\r\n\r\nEvans provides practical examples of how editing and rewriting can make for better communication, even in the digital age. Do I Make Myself Clear? is an essential text, and one that will provide every writer an editor at his shoulder.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-09-03T12:03:58.744Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:95f2534e076b43cad24e2a459ae6b7273f32ee18","dn":"Do I self Clear_ Why Writing Well Matters by Harold Evans","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"95f2534e076b43cad24e2a459ae6b7273f32ee18","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,242,83,78,7,107,67,202,210,78,42,69,154,230,183,39,63,50,238,24]},"name":"Do I self Clear_ Why Writing Well Matters by Harold Evans","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
