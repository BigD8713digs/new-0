As this question fills the airwaves with anticipation, their legions of fans continue to multiply and ask a different series of questions, like: Who are these people? What&apos;s the secret to their success? And is Chip actually that funny in real life?\r\n\r\nBy renovating homes in Waco, Texas, and changing lives in such a winsome and engaging way, Chip and Joanna have become more than just the stars of Fixer Upper; they have become America&apos;s new best friends. The Magnolia Story is the first book from Chip and Joanna, offering their fans a detailed look at their life together, from the very first renovation project they ever tackled together to the project that nearly cost them everything; from the childhood memories that shaped them to the twists and turns that led them to the life they share on the farm today.\r\n\r\nThey both attended Baylor University in Waco. However, their paths did not cross until Chip checked his car in to the local Firestone tire shop, where Joanna worked behind the counter. Even back then Chip was a serial entrepreneur who, among other things, ran a lawn care company, sold fireworks, and flipped houses. Soon they were married and living in their first fixer-upper. Four children and countless renovations later, Joanna garnered the attention of a television producer who noticed her work on a blog one day.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-07-27T12:00:30.183Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c23c824e85f04138999abaeb6386359001310bc","dn":"Chip Gaines - The Magnolia Story 2016 RETAiL ePUB eBOOK-DiSTRiBU","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"8c23c824e85f04138999abaeb6386359001310bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,35,200,36,232,95,4,19,137,153,171,174,182,56,99,89,0,19,16,188]},"name":"Chip Gaines - The Magnolia Story 2016 RETAiL ePUB eBOOK-DiSTRiBU","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
