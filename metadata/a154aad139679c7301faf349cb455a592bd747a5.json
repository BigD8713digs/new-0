Scher EPUB\r\n\r\nThe true story of a fiery young woman&apos;s heartwarming and hilarious journey that takes her from near-death in California to a trip around the world in search of her ultimate salvation. Along the way, she discovers a world of cultural mayhem, radical medical treatment, and, most importantly, a piece of her life she never even knew she was missing.\r\n\r\nWhen Amy B. Scher was struck with undiagnosed late-stage, chronic Lyme disease, the best physicians in America labeled her condition incurable and potentially terminal. Deteriorating rapidly, she went on a search to save her own life-from the top experts in Los Angeles and the world-renowned Mayo Clinic in Minneapolis to a state-of-the-art hospital in Chicago.\r\n\r\nAfter exhausting all of her options in the US, she discovered a possible cure - but it was highly experimental, only available in India, and had as much of a probability of killing her as it did of curing her. Knowing the risks, Amy packed her bags anyway and flew across the world hoping to find the ultimate cure.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-04-11T12:20:39.622Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:a154aad139679c7301faf349cb455a592bd747a5","dn":"This Is How I Save My Life by Amy B.
