After two years Cassie&apos;s become an expert on the rules, but newly arrived Margaret sees only her chance to explore. So when a fender bender sends Margaret to the local police station, Cassie reluctantly agrees to watch Margaret&apos;s toddler son. But as the hours pass, Cassie&apos;s boredom and frustration turn to fear: Why isn&apos;t Margaret answering her phone, and why is it taking so long to sort out a routine accident? Snooping around Margaret&apos;s apartment, Cassie begins to question not only her friend&apos;s whereabouts but also her own role in Margaret&apos;s disappearance.\r\n\r\nWith achingly honest prose and riveting characters, The Confusion of Languages plunges readers into a shattering collision between two women and two worlds, affirming Siobhan Fallon as a powerful voice in American fiction and a storyteller not to be missed.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-07-31T12:01:21.040Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:86cd3d75ff97a5ee0d7ba3366ecc850d5f45fab6","dn":"The Confusion of Languages by Siobhan Fallon ePUB eBOOK-ZAK","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"86cd3d75ff97a5ee0d7ba3366ecc850d5f45fab6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,205,61,117,255,151,165,238,13,123,163,54,110,204,133,13,95,69,250,182]},"name":"The Confusion of Languages by Siobhan Fallon ePUB eBOOK-ZAK","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
