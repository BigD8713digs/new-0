But what if we breached that mystery? How might it transform our relationship with God?\r\n\r\nAlthough the word trinity isn&apos;t found in the New Testament - it wasn&apos;t until the third century that it was coined - the idea of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit was present in Jesus&apos; life and teachings. In this book, internationally recognized teacher Richard Rohr circles around this paradoxical idea - and circling around is an apt metaphor: Early Christians applied the Greek verb for dance to the mystery of the Trinity, saying whatever is going on in God is a flow - it&apos;s like a dance.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-12-04T12:01:16.022Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:767304beda9b51e8113b44813d04ae4445eb1c4f","dn":"The Divine Dance by Richard Rohr EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"767304beda9b51e8113b44813d04ae4445eb1c4f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,115,4,190,218,155,81,232,17,59,68,129,61,4,174,68,69,235,28,79]},"name":"The Divine Dance by Richard Rohr EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
