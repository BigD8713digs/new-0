It films close up with the team of international engineers as they race to build the new structure before Chernobys original concrete sarcophagus - the hastily built structure that covers the reactor - collapses. \r\nBuilt to last just 30 years, the temporary sarcophagus is now crumbling, putting the world at risk of another release of radioactive dust. Radiation levels make it impossible for workers to build the new shelter directly over the old reactor, so engineers are erecting the new mega-structure - taller than the tower of Big Ben and three times heavier than the Eiffel Tower - to one side and will then face the challenge of sliding the largest object ever moved on land into place over the old reactor.\r\n\r\nVideo: MP4 H264 600p @1.5Mbps\r\nAudio: AAC 2ch @128Kbps\r\nSubtitles: English .SRT","last_updated":"2017-12-13T12:06:51.613Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:31e004fea6add8369c94d059bc689c185c10479d","dn":"BBC Inside Chernobyl's Mega Tomb MP4   subs BigJ0554","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"31e004fea6add8369c94d059bc689c185c10479d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,224,4,254,166,173,216,54,156,148,208,89,188,104,156,24,92,16,71,157]},"name":"BBC Inside Chernobyl's Mega Tomb MP4   subs BigJ0554","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
