Virgil knows the town of Trippton, Minnesota, a little too well. A few years back, he investigated the corrupt - and, as it turned out, homicidal - local school board, and now the town&apos;s back in view with more alarming news: A woman&apos;s been found dead, frozen in a block of ice. There&apos;s a possibility that it might be connected to a high school class of 20 years ago that has a midwinter reunion coming up, and so, wrapping his coat a little tighter, Virgil begins to dig into 20 years&apos; worth of traumas, feuds, and bad blood. In the process one thing becomes increasingly clear to him. It&apos;s true what they say: High school is murder","last_updated":"2017-11-05T12:11:18.495Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:76e46e72cc88a2c75f3a585880a736ab4b7f3908","dn":"Deep Freeze - John Sandford","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"76e46e72cc88a2c75f3a585880a736ab4b7f3908","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,228,110,114,204,136,162,199,95,58,88,88,128,167,54,171,75,127,57,8]},"name":"Deep Freeze - John Sandford","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
