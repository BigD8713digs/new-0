Shaped by Prohibition, the Depression, and war, Francis Albert Sinatra became the troubadour of urban loneliness. With his songs he enabled millions of others to tell their own stories, providing an entire generation with a sense of tradition and pride belonging distinctly to them.\r\n\r\nWith a new introduction by Hamill, this is a rich and touching portrait that lingers like a beautiful song.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-07-03T12:13:57.612Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:56eeed16b56c17640c68ac07bf17be4f466781ae","dn":"Why Sinatra Matters by Pete Hamill EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"56eeed16b56c17640c68ac07bf17be4f466781ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,238,237,22,181,108,23,100,12,104,172,7,191,23,190,79,70,103,129,174]},"name":"Why Sinatra Matters by Pete Hamill EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
