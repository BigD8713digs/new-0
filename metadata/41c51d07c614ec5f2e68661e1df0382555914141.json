To that end it includes several open source tools such as parted, gparted, partclone, clonezilla, ddrescue, and secure delete, among others.\r\n\r\n\r\nMD5SUM:\r\n\r\n7a0f3017a29860b1076691ae3fba3148 *pmagic_2017_06_12.iso\r\n649f7da38b0fd3463d3cc8d4e79d5dbf *pmagic_pxe_2017_06_12.tar.gz\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE: For those incapable of figuring out why my releases are larger than those by other people: It is because I release the complete Parted Magic package, including the PXE files. Like it says on the PM website, if you don&apos;t know what PXE is, then you don&apos;t need the PXE file.\r\n\r\n\r\nParted Magic pmagic_2017_06_12 News\r\n\r\nThis version of Parted Magic adds a few leaves and branches to our slow growing oak tree. Filezilla replaces gftp. Parted Magic now ships with a screen magnifier. The Linux kernel has been updated to 4.11.4 and includes the zfs-linux drivers. Clonezilla has been updated to 3.25.11 and tested by Steven Shiau. And as always, this release includes updated Xorg components and security fixes.\r\n\r\nBe sure to check the new releases of Wxfixboot 2.0.1 and Ddrescuegui 1.7.1 by Hamish McIntyre-Bhatty.\r\n\r\nUpdated programs: xorg-server-1.19.3, xf86-video-ati-7.9.0, xf86-video-amdgpu-1.3.0, drbl-2.23.23, clonezilla-3.25.11, ntfs-3g-2017.3.23, xf86-video-nouveau-1.0.15, mesa-13.0.6, libdrm-2.4.81, zfs-on-linux-0.7.0-rc4, spl-solaris-0.7.0-rc4, mozilla-firefox-52.1.0esr, kernel-firmware-20170515git, glibc-zoneinfo-2017b, flashplayer-plugin-25.0.0.171, wxfixboot-2.0.1, ddrescuegui-1.7.1, sudo-1.8.20p2, samba-4.4.14, openssl-1.0.2k, openssh-7.4p1, ntp-4.2.8p10, minicom-2.7.1, libtiff-4.0.7, libpcap-1.8.1, gnutls-3.5.8, freetype-2.6.3, expat-2.2.0, bind-9.10.4_P8\r\n\r\nAdded programs: vmg-3.7.1-i386-2+b1, usb_modeswitch-2.2.6, wxGTK3-3.0.2, libfilezilla-0.9.1, filezilla-3.25.1, gettext-0.19.8.1\r\n\r\nSee the changelog for a complete list of updated programs.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHANGE LOG:\r\n <a href=\"\nhttps://partedmagic.com/changelog/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://partedmagic.com/changelog/</a>\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE:\r\n\r\nPatrick Verner has decided to take this project commercial without any provision for non-profit or low-income individuals. While I applaud his recent creation of a student version, $49 per year is almost twice what some commercial partition/disk utilities go for. While it is true that Parted Magic offers more functionality, it is all via the work of others and without support, while the commercial offerings come with support.\r\n\t\t\r\nIn order to insure access to this excellent product for low-income individuals and non-profits, I am dedicating myself to purchasing this software and insuring it is available to these users. In this spirit, please, if you can afford this software, then purchase it","last_updated":"2017-06-13T12:03:29.128Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:41c51d07c614ec5f2e68661e1df0382555914141","dn":"Parted Magic 2017_06_12","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"41c51d07c614ec5f2e68661e1df0382555914141","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,197,29,7,198,20,236,95,46,104,102,30,29,240,56,37,85,145,65,65]},"name":"Parted Magic 2017_06_12","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
