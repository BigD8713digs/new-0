For many of us, it is the single greatest challenge in every area of our lives. We have been taught that anger itself is a sin and should be avoided at all costs. However, anger is also understood to be &apos;nature&apos;s way&apos; of preparing man to respond in times of danger. How then do we go about bringing this volatile emotion under the Lordship of Jesus Christ? Gary Chapman gives us the perfect tool to answer this and many other questions in The Other Side of Love. In this book, he takes a fresh look at the origin and purpose of anger.\r\n\r\nAsserting that anger is rooted in the holy nature of God, he reverently explains that anger flows from God&apos;s holiness and love. Gary Chapman draws on his extensive counseling experience to instruct us how to positively process our anger. This will help us to create and further cultivate healthy relationships. Helpful study questions for group or personal use conclude each chapter. Don&apos;t let anger get the best of you. Victory begins with understanding. Now is the time to make this critical investment in your walk with Christ.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-12-01T12:02:27.038Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9153fb1cf7bb239c2b74bb2c48b25c01e3f5a9f","dn":"Anger_ Taming a Powerful Emotion by Gary Chapman EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"d9153fb1cf7bb239c2b74bb2c48b25c01e3f5a9f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,21,63,177,207,123,178,57,194,183,75,178,196,139,37,192,30,63,90,159]},"name":"Anger_ Taming a Powerful Emotion by Gary Chapman EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
