Learning objectives are set for each topic, and although technical language is avoided as far as possible, a thorough glossary explains any specialized terms that are introduced in each chapter. The critical thinking of the reader is stimulated by a range of questions arising from the text context, and each chapter concludes with a brief discussion of some of the more important implications for public policies on health and fitness today and into the future. The material will be of particular interest to graduate and undergraduate students in public health, health promotion, health policy, kinesiology, physical education, but will be of interest also to many studying medicine, history and sociology","last_updated":"2017-09-21T12:00:43.788Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d7e0425f06a776e8efc2f9719eb69f9b36ef6e0","dn":"A History of Health and Fitness Implications for Policy Today(20","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"3d7e0425f06a776e8efc2f9719eb69f9b36ef6e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,126,4,37,240,106,119,110,142,252,47,151,25,235,105,249,179,110,246,224]},"name":"A History of Health and Fitness Implications for Policy Today(20","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
