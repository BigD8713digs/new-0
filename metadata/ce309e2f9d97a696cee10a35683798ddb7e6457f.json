I had never seen Black Stone Cherry live so far (yes, shame on me) but I heard a lot about them being an awesome live act. So I was accordingly curious. To cut to the point, I was not disappointed at all.\r\n\r\nBut let&#x2019;s start from the beginning&#x2026;.The venue (1,500 people can fit in there) was really crowded right from the beginning. A wide range of people of different age and music taste crowded into the venue and were obviously all Rock&#x2019;n&#x2019;Roll music lovers.\r\n\r\n7.00 p.m. sharp, the lights went out and the support band approached the stage. Actually I was expecting to see Theory of a Deadman but it was a British band called Toseland instead.  But nevertheless everybody was awaiting Black Stone Cherry to come on. And how they did it, opening the show with &#x201C;Me and Mary Jane&#x201D;. They ruled the gig from the very first second! I could feel the energetic fun the guys had with every single tone they performed. The music was wild, spontaneous, dirty, fresh and loud&#x2026;just a rock &#x2018;n&#x2019; roll should be!\r\n\r\nGuitarist Ben Wells and bassist Jon Lawton were like bouncing balls, hurtling over the stage. The powerful pounding drummer John Fred Young swirled his drumsticks around that it was like a bursting firework flames. Singer Chris Robertson was a calming fixing point that maintained his stature between his band mates&#x2013;but his limited action was made up by his even, nonetheless forceful singing and guitar playing.\r\n\r\nIts no wonder that this band is going to the next level.\r\n\r\n\r\n01 Blind Man\r\n02 Rain Wizard\r\n03 Backwoods Gold\r\n04 Peace Is Free\r\n05 White Trash Millionaire\r\n06 Audience Jam\r\n07 Maybe Someday\r\n08 Blame It On The Boom Boom\r\n09 Lonely Train\r\n\r\ntt: 41:05\r\n\r\n\r\n    Chris Robertson &#x2013; lead vocals, lead and rhythm guitar\r\n    Ben Wells &#x2013; rhythm and lead guitar, backing vocals\r\n    Jon Lawhon &#x2013; bass guitar, backing vocals\r\n    John Fred Young &#x2013; drums, percussion, piano, backing vocals","last_updated":"2017-10-01T12:11:52.463Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce309e2f9d97a696cee10a35683798ddb7e6457f","dn":"Black Stone Cherry -  Dortmund (Live) 2011 ak320","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"ce309e2f9d97a696cee10a35683798ddb7e6457f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,48,158,47,157,151,166,150,206,225,10,53,104,55,152,221,183,230,69,127]},"name":"Black Stone Cherry -  Dortmund (Live) 2011 ak320","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
