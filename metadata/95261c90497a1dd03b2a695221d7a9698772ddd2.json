Options are available for work in mixed media, crafts, photography and digital media, as well as in traditional drawing or painting media. After picking a theme of particular interest to you, look next at the four strands of lessons presented in that thematic unit. Moving from left to right, select one lesson from each consecutive strand and complete that lesson.\r\n\r\nBecause each lesson builds upon previously presented knowledge and developed skill, as you progress through four lessons, one from each strand, you should grow in your understanding of art concepts, meanings, and processes, while also improving your art making skills. Completing this course will help you develop a new appreciation for the power and possibilities of art learning, by understanding better the art others create, as well as making it yourself.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS (140 chapters)\r\nIntroduction and How to Use This Book\r\nBasics of Creating Works of Art\r\nThe Thematic Units\r\n1.Lessons in Drawing Realistically\r\n2.Lessons in Color and Paint\r\n3.Decorative and Graphic Design\r\n4.Art and Narrative Imagination\r\n5.Exploring Self and Others through Art\r\n6.Media Play\r\nGlossary\r\n <a href=\"\nhttps://s22.postimg.cc/45uh65apd/Art_Themes_Choices_in_Art_Learning_and_Making.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://s22.postimg.cc/45uh65apd/Art_Themes_Choices_in_Art_Learning_and_Making.jpg</a>","last_updated":"2018-07-21T12:05:10.057Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:95261c90497a1dd03b2a695221d7a9698772ddd2","dn":"Art Themes Choices in Art Learning and Making (gnv64)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"95261c90497a1dd03b2a695221d7a9698772ddd2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,38,28,144,73,122,29,208,59,42,105,82,33,215,169,105,135,114,221,210]},"name":"Art Themes Choices in Art Learning and Making (gnv64)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
