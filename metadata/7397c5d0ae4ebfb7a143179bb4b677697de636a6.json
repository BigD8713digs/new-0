It first presents the fundamental principles of spaceflight mechanics and then addresses more complex concepts and applications of perturbation theory, orbit determination and refinement, space propulsion, orbital maneuvers, interplanetary trajectories, gyroscope dynamics, attitude control, and rocket performance. Many algorithms used in the modern practice of trajectory computation are also provided. The numerical treatment of the equations of motion, the related methods, and the tables needed to use them receive particular emphasis. A large collection of bibliographical references (including books, articles, and items from the &quot;gray literature&quot;) is provided at the end of each chapter, and attention is drawn to many internet resources available to the reader. The book will be of particular value to undergraduate and graduate students in aerospace engineering.\r\n\r\nAbout the Author\r\nAlessandro de Iaco Veris holds a degree in civil engineering and another in aerospace engineering, summa cum laude, from the University of Rome. He has also undertaken special training, including a high-level professional course on &quot;Projet, calcul et emploi des fus&#xE9;es spatiales&quot; at the Ecole Nationale Sup&#xE9;rieure de l&apos;A&#xE9;ronautique et de l&apos;Espace (ENSAE) and a course on &quot;Dynamics of Controlled Structures&quot; at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). He is a strong proponent of the application of mathematics for practical purposes and in particular for the solution of problems arising in engineering. His experience is in the field of mathematical models and numerical methods for aerodynamics, space flight mechanics, system studies, and mission analysis. His professional interests focus on numerical integration methods used to predict the motion of space vehicles and Earth satellites subject to perturbations.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n1 The Two-Body Problem  . . . 1\r\n2 Orbit Determination from Observations . . . 129\r\n3 The Central Gravitational Force and Its Perturbations  . . . 323\r\n4 Impulsive Orbital Manoeuvres  . . . 571\r\n5 Interplanetary Trajectories  . . . 759\r\n6 Numerical Integration of the Equations of Motion  . . . 857\r\n7 Dynamics of Rigid Bodies  . . . 1001\r\n8 Instruments for Aerospace Navigation  . . . 1041\r\n9 Attitude Stabilisation and Control of Earth Satellites  . . . 1133\r\n10 Dynamics of Spinning Rockets  . . . 1213\r\n11 Performance and Optimisation of Rockets  . . . 1257\r\n <a href=\"\nhttps://s2.postimg.org/jlrvbr1sp/Practical_Astrodynamics.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://s2.postimg.org/jlrvbr1sp/Practical_Astrodynamics.jpg</a>","last_updated":"2017-12-04T12:07:06.551Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:7397c5d0ae4ebfb7a143179bb4b677697de636a6","dn":"Practical Astrodynamics (gnv64)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"7397c5d0ae4ebfb7a143179bb4b677697de636a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,151,197,208,174,78,191,183,161,67,23,155,180,182,119,105,125,230,54,166]},"name":"Practical Astrodynamics (gnv64)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
