That man was the Zen monk Eihei Dogen. For centuries his main work, Shobogenzo, languished in obscurity, locked away in remote monasteries until scholars rediscovered it in the 20th century. What took so long? In Brad Warner&apos;s view, Dogen was too ahead of his time to find an appreciative audience.\r\n\r\nTo bring Dogen&apos;s work to a bigger audience, Warner began paraphrasing Shobogenzo, recasting it in simple, everyday language. The first part of this project resulted in Don&apos;t Be a Jerk, and now Warner presents this second volume, It Came from Beyond Zen! Once again, Warner uses wry humor and incisive commentary to bridge the gap between past and present, making Dogen&apos;s words clearer and more relevant than ever before.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-07-01T12:12:08.450Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ef4d1639dcf97af3105825b1bc1c286a9f14fc9","dn":"It Came from Beyond Zen! by Brad Warner EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"8ef4d1639dcf97af3105825b1bc1c286a9f14fc9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,244,209,99,157,207,151,175,49,5,130,91,27,193,194,134,169,241,79,201]},"name":"It Came from Beyond Zen! by Brad Warner EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
