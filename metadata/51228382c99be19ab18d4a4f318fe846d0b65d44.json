Led by police officer Rick Grimes, his family and a group of other survivors find themselves constantly on the move in search of a safe and secure home. But the pressure each day to stay alive sends many in the group to the deepest depths of human cruelty, and Rick discovers that the overwhelming fear of the survivors can be more deadly than the zombies walking among them.\r\n\r\nFirst episode date: 31 October 2010\r\nTheme song: The Walking Dead theme song\r\nNetworks: AMC, FOX, AMC Networks","last_updated":"2017-11-20T12:06:56.680Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:51228382c99be19ab18d4a4f318fe846d0b65d44","dn":"The.Walking.Dead.S08E05.HDTV.x264.[Season.8.Episode.5]","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"51228382c99be19ab18d4a4f318fe846d0b65d44","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,34,131,130,201,155,225,154,177,141,74,79,49,143,232,70,208,182,93,68]},"name":"The.Walking.Dead.S08E05.HDTV.x264.[Season.8.Episode.5]","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
