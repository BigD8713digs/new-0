Is it to pass time? To learn something new? To escape from reality? For Will Schwalbe, reading is a way to entertain himself but also to make sense of the world, to become a better person, and to find the answers to the big (and small) questions about how to live his life. In this delightful celebration of reading, Schwalbe invites us along on his quest for books that speak to the specific challenges of living in our modern world, with all its noise and distractions. In each chapter he discusses a particular book - what brought him to it (or vice versa), the people in his life he associates with it, and how it became a part of his understanding of himself in the world. These books span centuries and genres (from classic works of adult and children&apos;s literature to contemporary thrillers and even cookbooks), and each one relates to the questions and concerns we all share. Throughout, Schwalbe focuses on the way certain books can help us honor those we&apos;ve loved and lost and figure out how to live each day more fully. Rich with stories and recommendations, Books for Living is a treasure for everyone who loves books and loves to hear the answer to the question &quot;what are you reading?&quot;\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-08-21T12:00:33.713Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:fece90aceed9507255cd866378911757f197ffea","dn":"Books for Living by Will Schwalbe 2016 RETAiL ePUB eBOOK-DiSTRiB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"fece90aceed9507255cd866378911757f197ffea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,206,144,172,238,217,80,114,85,205,134,99,120,145,23,87,241,151,255,234]},"name":"Books for Living by Will Schwalbe 2016 RETAiL ePUB eBOOK-DiSTRiB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
