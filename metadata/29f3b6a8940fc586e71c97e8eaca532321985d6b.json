After he&#x2019;d shot a marshal in Laramie and fled south, Kane was put on his trail. He didn&#x2019;t know much about the killer, beyond the fact that he was a superstitious woman-chaser, but he learned a little more from some of the strange assortment\r\n\r\nLouis Masterson  - The Claw of the Dragon\r\nKane&#x2019;s kick caught Zapata&#x2019;s underarm with terrible force.

Marshal Kane was not exactly new to such cases - but several things puzzled him about this one. What Kiowa would use a revolver and wear high-heeled boots? And why should two harmless Mexicans have been tortured to death?","last_updated":"2017-12-24T12:02:04.820Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:29f3b6a8940fc586e71c97e8eaca532321985d6b","dn":"Louis Masterson  - Gunman's Inheritance and others (EPUB)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"29f3b6a8940fc586e71c97e8eaca532321985d6b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,243,182,168,148,15,197,134,231,28,151,232,234,202,83,35,33,152,93,107]},"name":"Louis Masterson  - Gunman's Inheritance and others (EPUB)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
