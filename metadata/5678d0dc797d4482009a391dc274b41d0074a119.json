But in Brindle, Oregon, there&apos;s a secret nobody wants to see.\r\n\r\nTodd Fielding, a newly married young woman, comes to Brindle for a job with the local newspaper, which plans to celebrate the town&apos;s centennial by printing photos and letters from the town&apos;s history. But the relics of the past hide a dark secret.\r\n\r\nWhen a young girl disappears and no one in the town appears particularly concerned, Todd looks deeper. She uncovers the shocking fact that five other girls have run away from Brindle under strange circumstances over the past 20 years, but no one seems interested in finding them. As she begins to understand the history of a town steeped in evil, manipulation, and cold-blooded murder, she decides the secrecy has lasted far too long.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-07-29T12:00:26.119Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:5678d0dc797d4482009a391dc274b41d0074a119","dn":"The Price of Silence by Kate Wilhelm ePUB MOBI eBOOK-ZAK","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"5678d0dc797d4482009a391dc274b41d0074a119","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,120,208,220,121,125,68,130,0,154,57,29,194,116,180,29,0,116,161,25]},"name":"The Price of Silence by Kate Wilhelm ePUB MOBI eBOOK-ZAK","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
