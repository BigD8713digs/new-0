With his own research as well as that of some of the most distinguished scientists of our time, Sch&#xE4;fer moves us from a reality of Darwinian competition to cooperation, a meaningless universe to a meaningful one, and a disconnected, isolated existence to an interconnected one. In so doing, he shows us that our potential is infinite and calls us to live in accordance with the order of the universe, creating a society based on the cosmic principle of connection, emphasizing cooperation and community.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-12-26T12:08:15.021Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:d994129f3aca881f417d2424ea81e54a2d5491f4","dn":"Infinite Potential by Lothar Sch&auml;fer EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"d994129f3aca881f417d2424ea81e54a2d5491f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,148,18,159,58,202,136,31,65,125,36,36,234,129,229,74,45,84,145,244]},"name":"Infinite Potential by Lothar Sch&auml;fer EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
