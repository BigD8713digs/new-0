His next one is titled Anthems for Catharsis, marking the follow-up to last year&#x2019;s Rebirths, and the first LP of original material since 2013&#x2019;s Hex Mountains. \r\nThe new set of songs originated in Quach&#x2019;s Montreal studio, where he made a conscious effort to stretch the boundaries of the oft-repetitive genres of ambient and drone. This time around, he stripped the music down to its bones, focusing on purification and detoxification. In the process, he &#x201C;struck a black metal vein, resulting in a dark and brooding ice cold oozing of his signature drones.&#x201D; \r\nFrom the eerie opening notes and slow-building suspense of &#x201C;Ruminations&#x201D; to the onslaught of percussion throughout &#x201C;Purgation/Purification&#x201D; to the industrial airiness of &#x201C;From Darkness Redux,&#x201D; Thisquietarmy presents an array of intricate, icy and always intriguing pieces on Anthems of Catharsis. \r\n\r\nTracklist: \r\n01 - Ruminations.flac \r\n02 - Purgation - Purification.flac \r\n03 - From Darkness Redux.flac \r\n04 - Accommodator.flac \r\n05 - Masquerade.flac \r\n06 - Closure.flac \r\n\r\nSummary: \r\nCountry: Canada \r\nGenre: ambient, post-rock","last_updated":"2018-07-17T12:08:59.769Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:f17a95ba0e852da19d78dd02d7bb2cdc465b2070","dn":"[ambient, post-rock] (2015) thisquietarmy - Anthems for Catharsi","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"f17a95ba0e852da19d78dd02d7bb2cdc465b2070","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,122,149,186,14,133,45,161,157,120,221,2,215,187,44,220,70,91,32,112]},"name":"[ambient, post-rock] (2015) thisquietarmy - Anthems for Catharsi","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
