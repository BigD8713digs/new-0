After using this narcotic industrial chemical, he \r\nruthlessly kills his whole family - his wife, 12-year-old daughter and \r\nnewborn son &#x2013; out of severe hallucination. It was only after he sobers \r\nup that he realizes what a disaster he has brought to himself. So, he \r\ndecides to avenge those who were responsible for his decadence and for \r\nturning him into a human less worthy than an animal. Thus began the \r\nmurders and the unimaginable violence!
