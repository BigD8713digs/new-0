A decorated Eagle Scout who barely graduated from high school, the young man from Macon, Georgia, with an oversize personality used dogged determination to achieve his childhood dream of becoming a famed fighter pilot.\r\n\r\nFirst capturing national attention during World War II, Scott, a West Point graduate, flew missions in China alongside the legendary &quot;Flying Tigers&quot;, where his reckless courage and victories against the enemy made headlines. Upon returning home, Scott&apos;s memoir, God Is My Co-Pilot, became an instant best seller and a successful film. Later in life, Scott traveled the entire length of China&apos;s Great Wall and helped found Georgia&apos;s Museum of Aviation.\r\n\r\nYet Scott&apos;s life was not without difficulty. His single-minded pursuit of greatness was offset by bouts of depression, and his brashness placed him at odds with superior officers. What wealth he gained, he squandered, and his numerous public affairs destroyed his relationships with his wife and child.\r\n\r\nBacked by meticulous research, Double Ace brings Scott&apos;s uniquely American character to life and captures his fascinating exploits as a national hero alongside his frustrating foibles.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-09-04T12:00:33.319Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:838e57c0bf303575f8ef47d0090955300aafed13","dn":"Double Ace by Robert Coram 2016 RETAiL ePUB eBOOK-DiSTRiBUTiON","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"838e57c0bf303575f8ef47d0090955300aafed13","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,142,87,192,191,48,53,117,248,239,71,208,9,9,85,48,10,175,237,19]},"name":"Double Ace by Robert Coram 2016 RETAiL ePUB eBOOK-DiSTRiBUTiON","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
