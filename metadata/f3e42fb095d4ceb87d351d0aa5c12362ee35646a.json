Here are the guilty passions, loyalties and treacheries, political assassinations, sea battles and sieges, corruption in high places and a yearning for reform, satire and humor, sorcery and demonology, and lust and sadism on the stage. Here are proud cardinals, beggars, feminists, university scholars, grocers, bankers, mercenaries, mystics, lawyers, and tax collectors, and, dominating all, the knight in his valor and &quot;furious follies&quot;, a &quot;terrible worm in an iron cocoon&quot;.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-09-23T12:00:56.618Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:f3e42fb095d4ceb87d351d0aa5c12362ee35646a","dn":"A Distant Mirror_ The Calamitous 14th Century by Barbara W Tuchm","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"f3e42fb095d4ceb87d351d0aa5c12362ee35646a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,228,47,176,149,212,206,184,125,53,29,10,165,193,35,98,238,53,100,106]},"name":"A Distant Mirror_ The Calamitous 14th Century by Barbara W Tuchm","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
