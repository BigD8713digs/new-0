Kaufman EPUB\r\n\r\nHow far can you push an obsession before paying the ultimate price?\r\n\r\nSometimes what you don&#x2019;t know can hurt you. In Riley Harper&#x2019;s case, it&#x2019;s what she says she can&#x2019;t remember. Nearly a decade ago, Riley was the suspect in a murder investigation that destroyed her life and drove her into a psychiatric facility. Locked away for years, she was always guilty in the eyes of an unforgiving public.\r\n\r\nNow, after being released, all she wants is a fresh start, but the effort stalls when she becomes fixated on her new neighbor&#x2019;s extravagant life. She can&#x2019;t stop watching Samantha Light. And it&#x2019;s curiously satisfying.\r\n\r\nFor now, at least.\r\n\r\nBecause there&#x2019;s one more thing Riley doesn&#x2019;t know. And this time it may not just hurt her - it could kill her.\r\n\r\nIn this intense psychological thriller from Andrew E. Kaufman, author of Twisted, a woman besieged by her past spins deeper into turmoil and down a slope that may lead her to madness.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-04-08T12:11:57.826Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f951634bae95d9db200b1e2cabf531598ba9aeb","dn":"What She Doesn't Know by Andrew E.
