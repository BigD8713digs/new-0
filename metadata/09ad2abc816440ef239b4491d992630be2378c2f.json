The reason? His Cold War past has come back to claim him. Intelligence operations that were once the toast of secret London, and involved such characters as Alec Leamas, Jim Prideaux, George Smiley and Peter Guillam himself, are to be scrutinized by a generation with no memory of the Cold War and no patience with its justifications.\r\nInterweaving past with present so that each may tell its own intense story, John le Carr&#xE9; has spun a single plot as ingenious and thrilling as the two predecessors on which it looks back: The Spy Who Came in from the Cold and Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. In a story resonating with tension, humor and moral ambivalence, le Carr&#xE9; and his narrator Peter Guillam present the reader with a legacy of unforgettable characters old and new","last_updated":"2017-09-06T12:06:46.085Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:09ad2abc816440ef239b4491d992630be2378c2f","dn":"A Legacy of Spies by John le Carr&eacute; [ePub]","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"09ad2abc816440ef239b4491d992630be2378c2f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,173,42,188,129,100,64,239,35,155,68,145,217,146,99,11,226,55,140,47]},"name":"A Legacy of Spies by John le Carr&eacute; [ePub]","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
