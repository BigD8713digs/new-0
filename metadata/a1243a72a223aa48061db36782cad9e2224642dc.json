This wasn&apos;t it.\r\n\r\nNorway, 1940: Sub Lieutenant Harry Gilmour&apos;s first encounter with battleship action is not the adventure he had hoped for. \r\n\r\nFaced with a thankless task and ill equipped to handle it, Gilmour&apos;s inexperience leads to a damning allegation. His future hangs in the balance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2: [The Skipper&apos;s Dog&apos;s Called Stalin]\r\n\r\nSpring, 1941. France has fallen but the Free French naval forces are in no mood to surrender. \r\n\r\nRoyal Navy Sub-Lieutenant Harry Gilmour is also ready for action, despite the horrors of his first taste of submarine warfare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3: [Turn Left for Gibraltar]\r\n\r\nAs 1941 draws to a close, brave young men are fighting for freedom in countries across the globe. \r\n\r\nBut for Sub-Lieutenant Harry Gilmour, washed up in neutral Spain alongside &apos;interned belligerents&apos; from both sides of the war, hostilities have come to a pause.\r\n\r\n\r\nRead by: James Langton\r\n\r\nFormat: Stereo mp3\r\n\r\nBit Rate: 128Kbps/44.1Hz\r\n\r\n\r\nRemember to tip your uploader and seed! :)","last_updated":"2018-04-29T12:12:53.572Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1243a72a223aa48061db36782cad9e2224642dc","dn":"Harry Gilmour Series [ 1-3] - David Black","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"a1243a72a223aa48061db36782cad9e2224642dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,36,58,114,162,35,170,72,6,29,179,103,130,202,217,226,34,70,66,220]},"name":"Harry Gilmour Series [ 1-3] - David Black","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
