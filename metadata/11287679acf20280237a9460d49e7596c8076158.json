For example, mid&#x2013;latitude and subtropical climate extremes such as heat waves, hurricanes and droughts have increased, and could have been caused by processes including arctic amplification, jet stream meandering, and tropical expansion. This volume documents various climate extreme events and associated changes that have been analyzed through diagnostics, modeling, and statistical approaches. The identification of patterns and mechanisms can aid the prediction of future extreme events.\r\n\r\nVolume highlights include:\r\n\r\n&gt; Compilation of processes and mechanisms unique to individual weather and climate extreme events\r\n\r\n&gt; Discussion of climate model performance in terms of simulating high&#x2013;impact weather and climate extremes\r\n\r\n&gt; Summary of various existing theories, including controversial ones, on how climate extremes will continue to become stronger and more frequent\r\n\r\nClimate Extremes: Patterns and Mechanisms is a valuable resource for scientists and graduate students in the fields of geophysics, climate physics, natural hazards, and environmental science","last_updated":"2017-06-20T12:01:18.657Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:11287679acf20280237a9460d49e7596c8076158","dn":"Climate Extremes - Patterns and Mechanisms (2017) (Pdf) Gooner ","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"11287679acf20280237a9460d49e7596c8076158","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,40,118,121,172,242,2,128,35,122,148,96,212,158,117,150,200,7,97,88]},"name":"Climate Extremes - Patterns and Mechanisms (2017) (Pdf) Gooner ","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
