No more searching for rare drivers on discs or on the web or inserting one installation CD after the other. Just create a free account, log in, and start ing the updates that you need. You can also export all your current drivers (or just the ones that work ok) to a folder or a compressed file. After reinstalling Windows you will have everything in one place Most of the situations when Windows is running slower are caused by faulty driver installations. Windows stores all versions of older drivers just in case you want to go back; sometimes it messes up older versions with more recent ones. The Export Wizard will only export the drivers you select by copying the needed files to a folder or a compressed ZIP file. Why update my system drivers?\r\nIn computing, a device driver or software driver is a computer program allowing higher-level computer programs to interact with a hardware device. A driver typically communicates with the device through the computer bus or communications subsystem to which the hardware connects.\r\nindex-question\r\n\r\nWhat kind of drivers cand DriverMax update?\r\nWindows XP system drivers, Motherboards, Network Adapters, Video Adapters, Digital Cameras / Camcorders, MP3 Players, USB Devices, Modems, Keyboard, Windows Vista system drivers, VOIP (Voice Over IP) Phones, CD and DVD Drives, Sound Cards, Printers, Scanners, Webcams, Hard Disks, Wireless Devices, Mouse from different manufacturers like 3Com, Adaptec, AMD, Atheros, BenQ, Brother, Cisnet, Conexant, CXT, D-Link, Genius, Hauppauge, Hp, Intel, Leadtek, Lexmark, Logitech, Maxtor, MPC, Nikon, NVidia, Olympus, Philips, RealTek, Saitek, Sapphire, Sharp, Sony Ericcson , Toshiba, Western Digital","last_updated":"2018-09-21T12:30:05.904Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:a80ba6232d127be79b3348b9ce0b5c6a9a23454d","dn":"DriverMax Pro 10.15.0.23 Multilingual Full With Medicine[BabuPC]","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"a80ba6232d127be79b3348b9ce0b5c6a9a23454d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,11,166,35,45,18,123,231,155,51,72,185,206,11,92,106,154,35,69,77]},"name":"DriverMax Pro 10.15.0.23 Multilingual Full With Medicine[BabuPC]","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
