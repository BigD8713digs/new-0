It synthesizes nontrivial achievements of thermodynamics in important branches of chemical and biochemical engineering. Readers will gain an update on what has been achieved, what new research problems could be stated, and what kind of further studies should be developed within specialized research.\r\n\r\nPresents clearly structured chapters beginning with an introduction, elaboration of the process, and results summarized in a conclusion\r\nWritten by a first-class expert in the field of advanced methods in thermodynamics\r\nProvides a synthesis of recent thermodynamic developments in practical systems\r\nPresents very elaborate literature discussions from the past fifty years","last_updated":"2017-06-11T12:04:51.135Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:f98962d626eb671885c021e5280288b4e8b042cd","dn":"Thermodynamic Approaches in Engineering Systems","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"f98962d626eb671885c021e5280288b4e8b042cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,137,98,214,38,235,103,24,133,192,33,229,40,2,136,180,232,176,66,205]},"name":"Thermodynamic Approaches in Engineering Systems","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
