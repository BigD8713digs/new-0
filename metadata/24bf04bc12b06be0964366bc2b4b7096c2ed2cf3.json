The glittering prize was Henderson Airfield. Japanese planners knew that if they neutralized the airfield, the battle was won. So did the Marines who stubbornly defended it.\r\n\r\nThe outcome of the long slugfest remained in doubt under the pressure of repeated Japanese air, land, and sea operations. And losses were heavy. At sea, in a half-dozen fiery combats, the US Navy fought the Imperial Japanese Navy to a draw, but at a cost of more than 4,500 sailors. More American sailors died in these battles off Guadalcanal than in all previous US wars, and each side lost 24 warships. On land, more than 1,500 soldiers and Marines died, and the air war claimed more than 500 US planes. Japan&apos;s losses on the island were equally devastating--starving Japanese soldiers called it &quot;the island of death.&quot;\r\n\r\nBut when the attritional struggle ended, American Marines, sailors, and airmen had halted the Japanese juggernaut that for five years had whirled through Asia and the Pacific. Guadalcanal was America&apos;s first major ground victory against Japan and, most importantly, the Pacific War&apos;s turning point.\r\n\r\nPublished on the 75th anniversary of the battle and utilizing vivid accounts written by the combatants at Guadalcanal, along with Marine Corps and Army archives and oral histories, Midnight in the Pacific is both a sweeping narrative and a compelling drama of individual Marines, soldiers, and sailors caught in the crosshairs of history.\r\n\r\nHardcover: 400 pages\r\nPublisher: Da Capo Press (August 1, 2017)","last_updated":"2017-09-03T12:02:26.635Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:24bf04bc12b06be0964366bc2b4b7096c2ed2cf3","dn":"Midnight in the Pacific: The Battle of Guadalcanal","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"24bf04bc12b06be0964366bc2b4b7096c2ed2cf3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,191,4,188,18,176,107,224,150,67,102,188,43,75,112,150,194,237,44,243]},"name":"Midnight in the Pacific: The Battle of Guadalcanal","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
