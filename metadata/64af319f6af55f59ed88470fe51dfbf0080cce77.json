MARTIN\r\nPLAYBOY PAPERBACKS\r\nCopyright 1981 by Russ Martin\r\n\r\nSusan Browning has all that a woman could want: youth, beauty, a brilliant acting career, an utterly marvelous marriage. Then one night her husband saves a young woman from a hideously brutal rape. And when it&apos;s over, the rescued victim will shower them with love, gratitude, and devotion.\r\nWanda Carmichael. From the moment she enters their lives, Susan will never be the same. For Wanda Carmichael is a woman with strange, eerie powers. In the weeks to come, she will strip Susan of her career, of her marriage, of her self-respect. Susan Browning will become the groveling sexual slave of a man she loathes. Susan Browning will learn blind obedience, erotic ecstasy&#x2014;and satanic horror.\r\nAnd only then will the real nightmare begin","last_updated":"2017-12-03T12:04:56.130Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:64af319f6af55f59ed88470fe51dfbf0080cce77","dn":"Susan Browning Russ Martin","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"64af319f6af55f59ed88470fe51dfbf0080cce77","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,175,49,159,106,245,95,89,237,136,71,15,229,29,251,240,8,12,206,119]},"name":"Susan Browning Russ Martin","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
