The nations of the future increasingly have turned to   \r\nprivate military companies, also known as PMCs, to aid in      \r\ntheir defense. These elite mercenaries provide clear benefits  \r\nto the nations that engage them, but they also tend to take a  \r\nrather lax view of the law. Even so, the Reykjavik Accords    \r\nhave authorized the PMCs&apos; right to serve in every aspect of    \r\nmilitary operations. As the PMCs&apos; role is further legitimized  \r\nand their influence grows, concerns have begun to mount. Have  \r\nthe PMCs been granted too much power? And, if so, what will   \r\nthe consequences be for the world?                           \r\n                                                  \r\nTom Clancy&apos;s HAWX puts you in the pilot&apos;s seat for             \r\nrevolutionary aerial combat action in an all-too-realistic     \r\nworld of the near-future.
