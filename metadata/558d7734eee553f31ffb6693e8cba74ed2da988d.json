Hence, it is considered to be the building blocks of web development. Thus, if you are planning to be a web developer, especially front end web developer, learning html an css is a must. Moreover, since CSS literally requires no coding skill and knowing CSS can be an amazing tool to have in one&apos;s skill-set.\r\n\r\nI have tried to prepare this book as a CSS guide for beginners where CSS version 3 (CSS3) is considered. Therefore, if knowing CSS3 has been on your to-do list, why don&apos;t you take thirty minutes and read the book. However, since CSS is used to style HTML tag based web content, I have also discussed on HTML and HTML tags in the first chapter. Hence, those having fundamentals on HTML or even no understanding of HTML, this book can be a great help to start playing with CSS3.\r\n\r\nSimilar to web design for dummies, this book titled CSS for dummies aims to be a good resource for any beginner in web development industry. I hope you will enjoy this journey.\r\n\r\nThe ToC is as follows,\r\n\r\nChapter 1: Getting Started with HTML\r\nChapter 2: Getting Started with CSS\r\nChapter 3: Scratch Page Layout\r\nChapter 4: The Box Model\r\nChapter 5: HTML and CSS Scripts","last_updated":"2017-08-02T12:00:27.439Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:558d7734eee553f31ffb6693e8cba74ed2da988d","dn":"CSS for Dummies Learn CSS 3.0 in 30 Minutes(2017) - AZW3 - zeke2","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"558d7734eee553f31ffb6693e8cba74ed2da988d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,141,119,52,238,229,83,243,31,251,102,147,232,203,167,78,210,218,152,141]},"name":"CSS for Dummies Learn CSS 3.0 in 30 Minutes(2017) - AZW3 - zeke2","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
