Never before has there been such a riveting and candid memoir of life behind the diplomatic scenes. Meyer&apos;s is an honest account of what he saw, what he heard and how he felt. \r\n\r\nThe cast list of characters who feature here includes Margaret Thatcher, Bob Hope, the Clintons, Steven Spielberg, Condoleeza Rice, Alastair Campbell and Jack Straw. The book reveals close encounters with Tony Blair, Robin Cook and Peter Mandelson; KGB honey traps in Russia; a major row with Bill Clinton; inside stories on Number 10 and the Foreign Office; and of course life behind the scenes with Blair and George W. Bush. It was clear that the Prime Minister&apos;s office and not the Foreign Office would control relations with Washington, and Meyer shows in close up how he helped facilitate the &apos;special relationship&apos;.\r\n\r\nGenre: Non-Fiction &gt; Biographies &amp; Memoirs","last_updated":"2018-09-15T12:17:32.899Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:6bb216932a9d5b7064e969a26d673f93d4ceb58c","dn":"Dc Confidential by Christopher Meyer (.epub)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"6bb216932a9d5b7064e969a26d673f93d4ceb58c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,178,22,147,42,157,91,112,100,233,105,162,109,103,63,147,212,206,181,140]},"name":"Dc Confidential by Christopher Meyer (.epub)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
