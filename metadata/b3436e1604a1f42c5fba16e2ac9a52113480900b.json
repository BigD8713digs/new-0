Henry Fonda stars as a Juror who seeks to sway an otherwise unanimous jury\r\nin a case involving capital punishment. In the end this movie shows the power of a mans ability to convince others of his views, to the extent of having a life and death matter decided. Was he right? Did he use too many feigns to cause doubt when the case case already clear in fact? He may have let a guilty man walk in which case he may have risked the lives of others in the future if the suspect was in fact guilty as charged. See the movie and ask yourself if Henry Fonda&apos;s arguments made in this movie could have convinced you to change your vote in the case and whether you\r\nfind his arguments convincing in a substantial and meaningful manner in any event.\r\n\r\nKindly seed this great movie\r\n- with thanks!\r\n\r\nMichael Rizzo Chessman\r\n(moviesbyrizzo)\r\n\r\nSubtitles for:\r\nBulgarian Croatian Danish Dutch English Estonian Finnish French German Greek\r\nHungarian Italian Norwegian Portuguese Romanian Serbian Slovenian Spanish Swedish","last_updated":"2018-06-04T12:11:48.163Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:b3436e1604a1f42c5fba16e2ac9a52113480900b","dn":"12 Angry Men (1957) 1080p H.264 ENG-ITA-GER-POL (moviesbyrizzo)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"b3436e1604a1f42c5fba16e2ac9a52113480900b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,67,110,22,4,161,244,44,95,186,22,226,172,154,82,17,52,128,144,11]},"name":"12 Angry Men (1957) 1080p H.264 ENG-ITA-GER-POL (moviesbyrizzo)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
