Neither wife nor widow, she lives in a numb state of limbo until, in the heat of an English summer, she meets Bill, a black American GI. Despite their vastly different backgrounds, neither can deny the love that overcomes them in the frantic weeks that follow, when every day could be their last.\r\n\r\nAfter Eva discovers she&apos;s pregnant, Bill is shipped off to join the D-Day fight, leaving her alone in a bigoted world. As her mixed-race daughter, Louisa, grows up, how far will Eva go to keep her safe and bury the past? And how far will Louisa go to uncover the truth?\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-07-01T12:14:04.159Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b58438344942894bd61a8316f499c85d6ca082a","dn":"The Color of Secrets by Lindsay Ashford EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"1b58438344942894bd61a8316f499c85d6ca082a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,88,67,131,68,148,40,148,189,97,168,49,111,73,156,133,214,202,8,42]},"name":"The Color of Secrets by Lindsay Ashford EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
