However, their paths were quite different. Temple&apos;s logical mind controlled her social behavior. She interacted with many adults and other children, experiencing varied social situations. Logic informed her decision to obey social rules and avoid unpleasant consequences. Sean&apos;s emotions controlled his social behavior. Baffled by social rules, isolated and friendless, he made up his own, and applied them to others. When they inevitably broke his rules, he felt worthless and unloved.\r\n\r\nBoth Temple and Sean ultimately came to terms with the social world and found their places in it. Whether you are a person with autism, a caregiver in the autism community, or just someone interested in an outsider view of society, their powerful stories will enthrall and enlighten you.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-10-22T12:01:48.376Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ab88bdb9e71e6eb3bad0d01c0dd5922dec0eea0","dn":"Unwritten Rules of Social Relationships by Temple Grandi","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"6ab88bdb9e71e6eb3bad0d01c0dd5922dec0eea0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,184,139,219,158,113,230,235,59,173,13,1,192,221,89,34,222,192,238,160]},"name":"Unwritten Rules of Social Relationships by Temple Grandi","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
