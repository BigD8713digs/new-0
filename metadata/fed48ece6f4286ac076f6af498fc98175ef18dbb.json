A place of intoxicating beauty . . . where trouble hits with the force of a hurricane.\r\n\r\nInheriting a beautiful old hotel on the Outer Banks could be a dream come true for Libby. The inn cries out for her restorer&apos;s talent and love of history. She&apos;s delighted to learn of the family she never knew she had. And the handsome Coast Guard lieutenant she&apos;s met there on the island could definitely be the man of her dreams.\r\n\r\nBut Libby soon realizes that the only way she can afford the upkeep on the inn is to sell it to developers who are stalking the island. The father who willed her the inn has died before she could meet him, and her newfound brother and sister are convinced she&apos;s there to steal their birthright. Worst of all, her best friend and business partner has been kidnapped before her eyes, and Libby&apos;s under suspicion for the crime.\r\n\r\nLibby&apos;s dream come true is becoming a nightmare. Her only option is to find her friend and prove her innocence, or lose everything on the shores of Hope Island","last_updated":"2017-09-04T12:01:01.944Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:fed48ece6f4286ac076f6af498fc98175ef18dbb","dn":"Colleen Coble-Tidewater Inn","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"fed48ece6f4286ac076f6af498fc98175ef18dbb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,212,142,206,111,66,134,172,7,111,106,244,152,252,152,23,94,241,141,187]},"name":"Colleen Coble-Tidewater Inn","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
