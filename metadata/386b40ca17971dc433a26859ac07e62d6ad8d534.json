Immediately it must be stated that this list of songs is not your normal \r\nrun of the mill Hawkwind back catalogue of songs devoted fans have already \r\nowned for years. This time around the band have reinvented themselves with new \r\nstudio versions of some of their most beloved tracks such as stirring versions \r\nof Assault &amp; Battery and Golden Void, originally from the masterful &quot;Warrior On \r\nThe Edge Of Time&quot;. \r\n\r\nThe conclusion that can be reached after hearing these songs is it was nice to \r\nrelive some of the Hawkwind back catalogue with the new spin on it from this \r\n2013 lineup. The new songs are okay though nothing too flash. All in all it is \r\na Hawkwind album worth visiting and cements their reputation as Masters of the \r\nSpace Rock Universe","last_updated":"2017-11-05T12:07:48.946Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:386b40ca17971dc433a26859ac07e62d6ad8d534","dn":"Hawkwind 2013 compilation (Spacehawks) 16 tracks 69 minutes FLAC","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"386b40ca17971dc433a26859ac07e62d6ad8d534","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,107,64,202,23,151,29,196,51,162,104,89,172,7,230,45,106,216,213,52]},"name":"Hawkwind 2013 compilation (Spacehawks) 16 tracks 69 minutes FLAC","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
