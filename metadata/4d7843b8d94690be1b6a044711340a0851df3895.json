Kandlikar et al. (Elsevier, 2014).pdf\r\n\r\nHeat exchangers with minichannel and microchannel flow passages are becoming increasingly popular due to their ability to remove large heat fluxes under single-phase and two-phase applications.\r\n\r\nHeat Transfer and Fluid Flow in Minichannels and Microchannels methodically covers gas, liquid, and electrokinetic flows, as well as flow boiling and condensation, in minichannel and microchannel applications. Examining biomedical applications as well, the book is an ideal reference for anyone involved in the design processes of microchannel flow passages in a heat exchanger.\r\n\r\nEach chapter is accompanied by a real-life case study\r\nNew edition of the first book that solely deals with heat and fluid flow in minichannels and microchannels\r\nPresents findings that are directly useful to designers; researchers can use the information in developing new models or identifying research needs","last_updated":"2017-06-07T12:05:20.813Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d7843b8d94690be1b6a044711340a0851df3895","dn":"Heat Transfer and Fluid Flow in Minichannels and Microchannels 2","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"4d7843b8d94690be1b6a044711340a0851df3895","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,120,67,184,217,70,144,190,27,106,4,71,17,52,10,8,81,223,56,149]},"name":"Heat Transfer and Fluid Flow in Minichannels and Microchannels 2","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
