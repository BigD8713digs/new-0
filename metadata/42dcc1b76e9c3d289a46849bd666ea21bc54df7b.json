There are two files, one labeled 1980s and the other, labeled 1990s and they each have two disc files that contain songs from compilations that I&apos;ve created: The Contemporary Instrumentals Collection, Vol. 1: The 1980s and The Contemporary Instrumentals Collection, Vol. 2: The 1990s. The set features artists such as The Rippingtons, Suzanne Ciani, Michael Gettel, Fattburger, and many more. Also the songs featured in this collection are a tribute to the Music Choice channel, &quot;Contemporary Instrumentals&quot;, a channel that is only available in limited areas (I once had it on my TV for a year before the signal dropped). Anyway, I hope you enjoy the music","last_updated":"2017-06-15T12:06:27.181Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:42dcc1b76e9c3d289a46849bd666ea21bc54df7b","dn":"Contemporary Instrumentals Collection","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"42dcc1b76e9c3d289a46849bd666ea21bc54df7b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,220,193,183,110,156,61,40,154,70,132,155,214,102,234,33,188,84,223,123]},"name":"Contemporary Instrumentals Collection","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
