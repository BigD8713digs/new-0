In the end we must be fair to all concerned\r\n\r\nMichael Rizzo Chessman\r\n(moviesbyrizzo)","last_updated":"2018-10-05T12:07:09.531Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:9db7c4410da5ac0bae5ec24fed7ae97e9ca7a0cb","dn":"Herzsprung (Germany) (1992) H.264 (moviesbyrizzo) eng subs","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"9db7c4410da5ac0bae5ec24fed7ae97e9ca7a0cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,183,196,65,13,165,172,11,174,94,194,79,237,122,233,126,156,167,160,203]},"name":"Herzsprung (Germany) (1992) H.264 (moviesbyrizzo) eng subs","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
