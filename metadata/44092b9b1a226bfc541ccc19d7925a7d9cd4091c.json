With unique access to the family&apos;s inner world, this programme unearths the lasting cultural impact of three generations.\r\n\r\nThe late patriarch J Paul Getty, founder of the Getty Oil Company and art collector, made the family incredibly wealthy and was once described as the richest living man in America. On his death, he left the largest endowment in history to an art museum, and the billion-dollar gift shook the international art market to its foundation. This endowment also gave birth to the Getty Centre in Los Angeles, which is now the wealthiest institution of its kind in the world.\r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n * Video Codec: x265/HEVC CABAC Main10 L4\r\n * Video Bitrate: CRF 22 (~2393Kbps)\r\n * Video Resolution: 1920x1080\r\n * Frame Rate: 25 FPS\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC-LC\r\n * Audio Bitrate: Q=0.46 VBR 48KHz (~126Kbps)\r\n * Audio Channels: 2\r\n * Run-Time: 74 mins\r\n * Part Size: 1.30 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Subtitles: Merged","last_updated":"2018-09-17T12:04:13.650Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:44092b9b1a226bfc541ccc19d7925a7d9cd4091c","dn":"BBC Gettys The Worlds Richest Art Dynasty 1080p x265 AAC HDTV MV","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"44092b9b1a226bfc541ccc19d7925a7d9cd4091c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,9,43,155,26,34,107,252,84,28,204,25,215,146,90,125,156,212,9,28]},"name":"BBC Gettys The Worlds Richest Art Dynasty 1080p x265 AAC HDTV MV","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
