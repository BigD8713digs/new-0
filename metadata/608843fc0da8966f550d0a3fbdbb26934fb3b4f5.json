Tenacious madam Clara Palmer contended with constant police raids during the 1880s and &apos;90s. Only her death could shut the doors of her gilded bordello in Cleveland. Failed actress Mildred Gillars left for Europe right before World War II. \r\n\r\nBecause she fell in love with the wrong man, she wound up peddling Nazi propaganda on the radio as &quot;Axis Sally.&quot; Volatile Hester Foster was already doing time at the Ohio State Penitentiary when she bashed in the head of a fellow inmate with a shovel. The sinister Anna Marie Hahn dosed at least five elderly Cincinnati men with arsenic and croton oil and then watched them die in agony while pretending to nurse them back to health. Award-winning crime writer Jane Ann Turzillo recounts the stories of Ohio&apos;s most notorious vixens, viragoes and villainesses.\r\n\r\nGenre: Non-Fiction &gt; General","last_updated":"2018-09-15T12:17:52.029Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:608843fc0da8966f550d0a3fbdbb26934fb3b4f5","dn":"Wicked Women of Ohio by Jane Ann Turzillo (.epub)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"608843fc0da8966f550d0a3fbdbb26934fb3b4f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,136,67,252,13,168,150,111,85,13,10,63,189,187,38,147,79,179,180,245]},"name":"Wicked Women of Ohio by Jane Ann Turzillo (.epub)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
