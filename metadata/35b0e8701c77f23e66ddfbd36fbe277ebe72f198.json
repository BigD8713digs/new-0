So very inspirational I think.\r\nPaul Newman&apos;s character is flawless and his acting superb I believe.\r\n\r\nIt is a &quot;comeback story&quot; - perhaps the best that&apos;s ever been told.\r\nWe do learn however that even those who might mean well (as Newsmans character\r\nis seen to be I would say certainly), can be at odds with the dictates\r\nof common courtesy and duty, integrity and rightful conduct as I would say \r\nNewman&apos;s character is in failing to disclose to his clients (as a lawyer\r\n that he is) that he has an offer on the table from their opponents in this case - The Catholic Church run hospital in town, on a malpractice claim against them.\r\n\r\nInstead Newman&apos;s character takes on a huge risk to go to trial instead - a complete\r\ngamble really that could only payoff with his hunch being possibly correct in this choice of strategy instead - a miracle would have been needed for it to work I \r\nbelieve were it not that this is after all a hollywood story trying perhaps to\r\nconvince us of Newman&apos;s character&apos;s intuitive judgement as supreme in such a \r\ncase perhaps and should be trusted regardless.\r\n\r\nOh, well, Newman will always remain a favourite I believe for those of us \r\nthat think so much of his performance in this movie and &quot;Th Sting&quot; too (with \r\nMr. Robert Redford - another greatest actor). We do have &quot;The Sting&quot; posted for your enjoyment here additionally, and its Multi audio too for you if required\r\nadditionally.\r\n\r\nenjoy and please seed\r\n\r\nMichael Rizzo Chessman\r\n(moviesbyrizzo)\r\n \r\n\r\nSubtitles from bluray disc - (Polish and Romanian came from sites on the net)\r\nEnglish (template) Hearing impaired\r\nDanish Dutch Finnish French German Italian Norwegian Polish Portuguese\r\nRomanian Spanish and Swedish","last_updated":"2018-07-19T12:15:10.174Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:35b0e8701c77f23e66ddfbd36fbe277ebe72f198","dn":"The Verdict (1982) ENG-FRE-GER-ITA-SPA 1080p H.264 moviesbyrizzo","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"35b0e8701c77f23e66ddfbd36fbe277ebe72f198","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,176,232,112,28,119,242,62,102,221,251,211,111,190,39,126,190,114,241,152]},"name":"The Verdict (1982) ENG-FRE-GER-ITA-SPA 1080p H.264 moviesbyrizzo","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
