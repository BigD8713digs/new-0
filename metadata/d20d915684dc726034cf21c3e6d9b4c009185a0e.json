John von Neumann, whose many contributions to science, mathematics, and engineering include the basic organizational framework at the heart of today&apos;s computers, concludes that the brain operates both digitally and analogically, but also has its own peculiar statistical language.\r\n\r\nIn his foreword to this new edition, Ray Kurzweil, a futurist famous in part for his own reflections on the relationship between technology and intelligence, places von Neumann&#x2019;s work in a historical context and shows how it remains relevant today.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-12-14T12:01:38.835Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:d20d915684dc726034cf21c3e6d9b4c009185a0e","dn":"The Computer and the Brain (3e) by John von Neumann EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"d20d915684dc726034cf21c3e6d9b4c009185a0e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,13,145,86,132,220,114,96,52,207,33,195,230,217,180,192,9,24,90,14]},"name":"The Computer and the Brain (3e) by John von Neumann EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
