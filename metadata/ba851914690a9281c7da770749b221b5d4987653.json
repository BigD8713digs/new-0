Yes\nthe game is in the small end, but PLAZA&apos;s 566mb release is NOT valid at\nall\n\nFirst of all, there is no Quality of Life DLC, nor does their release\noffer any free campaign of any other game free content, that enhance\nthe game\n\nSecondary, when you can update our totally valid release with a 3mb\nupdate, then it&apos;s complete insanity to even accept theirs\n\nThird thing that comes into our minds, rules - why do sites not nuke\ntheir release? Why do we even have nukenets, when they don&apos;t qualify\nto live up to the rulesets.
