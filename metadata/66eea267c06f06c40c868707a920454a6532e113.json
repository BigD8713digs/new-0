English-dubbed versions have been released under several titles, including The Little Prince and the Eight-Headed Dragon, Prince in Wonderland and Rainbow Bridge.[1]\r\n\r\nBased on the Shinto myth of the storm god Susanoo&apos;s battle with the Yamata no Orochi, the color, &quot;ToeiScope&quot; anamorphic format film is scripted by Ichiro Ikeda and Takashi Iijima and directed by Yugo Serikawa. It is considered one of the very best of the Toei Doga features and a landmark in anime and animated features in general,[2] placing 10th in the list of the 150 best animated films and series of all time compiled by Tokyo&apos;s Laputa Animation Festival from an international survey of animation staff and critics in 2003.[3] It features distinctively modernist, abstracted character, background and color design, formalised the role of animation director, performed here by Yasuji Mori, in the Japanese system and drew attention to the talents of key animators Yasuo Otsuka and Yoichi Kotabe (whose key animation for the film, though he is credited in it as an in-betweener, is his first)[4] and assistant directors Isao Takahata and Kimio Yabuki. The score, composed by Akira Ifukube, is also acclaimed.[5]","last_updated":"2017-08-23T12:03:34.930Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:66eea267c06f06c40c868707a920454a6532e113","dn":"The Little Prince And The Eight-Headed Dragon (Susano)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"66eea267c06f06c40c868707a920454a6532e113","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,238,162,103,192,111,6,196,12,134,135,7,169,32,69,74,101,50,225,19]},"name":"The Little Prince And The Eight-Headed Dragon (Susano)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
