Today, it would take two days to finish and cost less than getting a pizza delivered.\r\n\r\nIt&apos;s estimated that 40 percent of the current Fortune 500 companies will no longer exist by 2025.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, half a billion devices were connected to the Internet. By 2030, that number will reach one trillion.\r\n\r\nThe traditional paradigms of how we live, learn, and invest are shifting under our feet. Ric Edelman has seen the future, and he explains how smart investors can adapt and thrive in today&apos;s changing marketplace. Using the same prophetic insight that has made him an iconic financial advisor, Edelman offers sound, practical investment advice through the lens of recent scientific and technological advancements. He illustrates how discoveries in robotics, nanotechnology, 3-D printing, solar energy, biotechnology, and medicine will redefine our life expectancies, careers, and retirements. As we live and work longer, Edelman provides clear advice on how to recalibrate the way we save for college, invest during our careers, and plan for retirement.\r\n\r\nThe Truth About Your Future, featuring Edelman&apos;s proven advice and trademark humor, is a timely, must-have guide for anyone serious about successfully adapting to the ever-evolving financial landscape.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-07-05T12:00:14.709Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:8da9cc80fc4626c4c11c0d27089945bb86ef3d97","dn":"Ric Edelman - The Truth About Your Future 2017 RETAiL ePUB eBOOK","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"8da9cc80fc4626c4c11c0d27089945bb86ef3d97","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,169,204,128,252,70,38,196,193,28,13,39,8,153,69,187,134,239,61,151]},"name":"Ric Edelman - The Truth About Your Future 2017 RETAiL ePUB eBOOK","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
