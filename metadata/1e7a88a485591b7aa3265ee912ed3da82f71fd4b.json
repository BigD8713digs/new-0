Her record label believes the solution is to have her open for up-and-comer Juliette Barnes on tour, but Juliette is a schemer and wants nothing more than to steal Rayna&apos;s spotlight. Rayna thinks her real chance is in another young woman, undiscovered songwriter Scarlett O&apos;Connor. While Rayna struggles with her career, her father is busy messing with her private life, encouraging her husband to run for election to be mayor of Nashville - against her wishes.\r\n\r\nFirst episode date: 10 October 2012\r\nTheme song: Nashville theme song\r\nNetworks: American Broadcasting Company, CMT\r\nAwards: Critics&apos; Choice Television Award for Most Exciting New Series, Academy of Country Music Awards Tex Ritter Award","last_updated":"2018-01-05T12:03:34.837Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e7a88a485591b7aa3265ee912ed3da82f71fd4b","dn":"Nashville.2012.S06E01.720p.WEB.x264.[400MB]","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"1e7a88a485591b7aa3265ee912ed3da82f71fd4b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,122,136,164,133,89,27,122,163,38,94,233,18,237,61,168,47,113,253,75]},"name":"Nashville.2012.S06E01.720p.WEB.x264.[400MB]","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
