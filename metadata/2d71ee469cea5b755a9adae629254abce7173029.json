In 1971 a novice-level magazine, Everyday Electronics, was begun by the same publisher. Until 1977, both titles had the same production and editorial team.\r\n\r\nIn 1986, both titles were sold by their owner, IPC Magazines, to independent publishers and the editorial teams remained separate.\r\n\r\nBy the early 1990s, the title experienced a marked decline in market share and, in 1992, it was purchased by Wimborne Publishing Ltd. which was, at that time, the publisher of the rival, novice-level Everyday Electronics. The two magazines were merged to form Everyday with Practical Electronics (EPE) - the &quot;with&quot; in the title being dropped from the November 1995 issue. In February 1999, the publisher acquired the former rival, Electronics Today International, and merged it into EPE","last_updated":"2017-06-09T12:00:34.105Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d71ee469cea5b755a9adae629254abce7173029","dn":"Everyday Practical Electronics - July 2017 - True PDF - zeke23","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"2d71ee469cea5b755a9adae629254abce7173029","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,113,238,70,156,234,91,117,90,154,218,230,41,37,74,188,231,23,48,41]},"name":"Everyday Practical Electronics - July 2017 - True PDF - zeke23","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
