The Ayoubi family originally hail from Syria and their food is steeped in history. They are hoping their clever use of simple ingredients and generous sharing dishes will have the judges coming back for more, but to secure a place in the next round they need to outcook the Herberts. For the Herbert family, cooking, particularly baking, runs in the blood. They love to experiment with weird and wonderful flavours but will this be a recipe for success or a step too far for the judges?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal Air Date: 14-Sep-2017","last_updated":"2017-09-22T12:15:42.605Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:17bc1370dbd25d65dfa6e990239c1a88690bd146","dn":"The.Big.Family.Cooking.Showdown.S01E05.480p.HDTV.x264-RMTeam.mkv","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"17bc1370dbd25d65dfa6e990239c1a88690bd146","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,188,19,112,219,210,93,101,223,166,233,144,35,156,26,136,105,11,209,70]},"name":"The.Big.Family.Cooking.Showdown.S01E05.480p.HDTV.x264-RMTeam.mkv","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
