From Francis Drake&apos;s circumnavigation of the globe to the ascent of Everest, British explorers crossed oceans and continents and ventured where few, if any, had gone before. Until very recently, that legacy of exploration had not extended to space.\nFor decades, successive governments chose to stay out of the human spaceflight programme, but in 2008 there were signs of optimism when ESA selected a new class of six astronauts, including, for the first time, a British representative: Timothy Peake. \n\nAbout the Author\nDr. Erik Seedhouse is an assistant professor in applied aviation sciences/commercial space operations and a research scientist specializing in space life sciences and physiology, the subject in which he obtained his Ph.D. while working for the European Space Agency between 1996 and 1998. In 2009, he was one of the final candidates for selection as an astronaut in the CSA&#x2019;s Astronaut Recruitment Campaign. He has completed all the training required by a suborbital astronaut and hopes to fly on Blue Origin&apos;s New Shepard vehicle in the near future. Between 2008-13 he was Director of Canada&apos;s Manned Centrifuge and Hypobaric Chamber Operations. He works as an assistant professor at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, a manned spaceflight consultant, triathlon coach, author and public speaker.\n\nCONTENTS\nAcknowledgements.... vii\nDedication.... viii\nAbout the Author.... ix\nAcronyms and Abbreviations.... xi\nList of Tables.... xiv\nPreface.... xvi\n1. 26 million horsepower....1\n2.
