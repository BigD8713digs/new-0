Boyatzis, A. McKee EPUB\r\n\r\nDaniel Goleman&apos;s international best seller Emotional Intelligence forever changed our concept of &quot;being smart,&quot; showing how emotional intelligence (EI) - how we handle ourselves and our relationships - can determine life success more than IQ. Then, Working with Emotional Intelligence revealed how stellar career performance also depends on EI.\r\n\r\nNow, Goleman teams with renowned EI researchers Richard Boyatzis and Annie McKee to explore the role of emotional intelligence in leadership. Unveiling neuroscientific links between organizational success or failure and &quot;primal leadership,&quot; the authors argue that a leader&apos;s emotions are contagious. If a leader resonates energy and enthusiasm, an organization thrives; if a leader spreads negativity and dissonance, it flounders.\r\n\r\nDrawing from decades of analysis, the authors show that resonant leaders excel not just through skill and smarts but also by connecting with others, using EI competencies such as empathy and self-awareness. And they employ up to six leadership styles - from visionary to coach to pacesetter - fluidly interchanging them as the situation demands. The program no leader in any walk of life can afford to miss, this unforgettable work transforms the art of leadership into the science of results.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-02-07T12:04:45.949Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb7790017afa6ca89c9b114eef73adf736c97ef3","dn":"Primal Leadership by Daniel Goleman, R.
