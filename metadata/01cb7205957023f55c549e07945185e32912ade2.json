The show revolves around the Harmons, a family of three, who move from Boston to Los Angeles in order to reconcile past anguish. What the Harmons don&apos;t know is that the house they&apos;ve moved into is haunted. But it&apos;s not haunted by Casperesque friendly ghosts -- it&apos;s haunted by demonic creatures. The creatures have a history of not only spooking the house&apos;s residents but also devouring them. After living in this house, family patriarch and psychiatrist, Ben, may need a shrink of his own","last_updated":"2018-11-15T13:26:40.679Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:01cb7205957023f55c549e07945185e32912ade2","dn":"American.Horror.Story.S08E10.720p.WEBRip.x264.[461MB].[MP4]","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"01cb7205957023f55c549e07945185e32912ade2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,203,114,5,149,112,35,245,92,84,158,7,148,81,133,227,41,18,173,226]},"name":"American.Horror.Story.S08E10.720p.WEBRip.x264.[461MB].[MP4]","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
