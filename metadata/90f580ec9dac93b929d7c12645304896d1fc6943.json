She watches her daily, and after writing to Rachel for a school project - and actually getting a response - Brynn starts drafting emails to Rachel but never sending them. Brynn tells Rachel about breaking up with her first serious girlfriend, about her brother Nick&apos;s death, about her passive mother and even worse stepfather, about how she&apos;s stuck in remedial courses at school and is considering dropping out.\r\n\r\nThen Brynn is confronted with a moral dilemma. One student representative will be allowed to have a voice among the administration in the selection of a new school superintendent. Brynn&apos;s archnemesis, Adam, and ex-girlfriend, Sarah, believe only Honors students are worthy of the selection committee seat. Brynn feels all students deserve a voice.
