With energy usage in buildings accounting for over 40% of primary energy use and 24% of greenhouse gas emissions worldwide, this remains an unavoidable objective.\r\n\r\nThe book looks at the life of the systems of energy production from renewable sources amidst the exceptionally challenging global economic crisis that the Mediterranean areas and other societies are currently experiencing. By using an innovative and interdisciplinary approach of socio-oriented technological design, the book indicates tools and measures that can be developed at the public, legislative, and market levels to counterbalance the large pay-back times of energy efficiency measures.\r\n\r\nIn particular, the book displays guidelines and best practices to activate new forms of economic incentives in order to attract potential investors that demonstrate that a large set of possible solutions is technically feasible to achieve nearly zero energy, even in high energy consuming circumstances and urban settings.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, by discussing and comparing the economic and energy impact of different technology options, this work offers guidelines and best practices to activate new cost-effective forms and social incentives in order to attract both potential investors and motivate the urban stakeholders toward nearly zero energy.\r\n\r\nStrategies and zero energy solutions for practitioners\r\nPolicy s and economic resolutions to combat legislative barriers\r\nExamples and case studies of nearly zero energy urban environments","last_updated":"2017-06-11T12:04:54.564Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:da0a834c39bfb92b2439621d9fef95ebb2a16a46","dn":"Towards Nearly Zero Energy - Annarita Ferrante","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"da0a834c39bfb92b2439621d9fef95ebb2a16a46","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,10,131,76,57,191,185,43,36,57,98,29,159,239,149,235,178,161,106,70]},"name":"Towards Nearly Zero Energy - Annarita Ferrante","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
