Donald Trump&#x2019;s presidency has raised the specter of authoritarian rule. Extreme polarization and the scorched-earth war between the parties drags on with no end in sight. The recent Kavanaugh confirmation hearings are only the latest example of this, and of the GOP&#x2019;s continued ability to steamroll the Democrats and their supporters. \r\n\r\nAt the heart of this dangerous moment is a paradox: It took a figure as uniquely menacing as Trump to rivet the nation&#x2019;s attention on the fragility of our democracy. Yet the causes of our dysfunction are long-running&#x2014;they predate Trump, helped facilitate his rise, and, distressingly, will outlast his presidency. \r\n\r\nGenre: Non-Fiction &gt; History","last_updated":"2018-10-17T12:32:32.439Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:4a9a99a95ef6412c9f88b34c201c94f94d97382d","dn":"An Uncivil War by Greg Sargent (.epub)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"4a9a99a95ef6412c9f88b34c201c94f94d97382d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,154,153,169,94,246,65,44,159,136,179,76,32,28,148,249,77,151,56,45]},"name":"An Uncivil War by Greg Sargent (.epub)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
