Starting as a weekly in the mid-1920s, the magazine is now published 47 times per year, with five of these issues covering two-week spans. Although its reviews and events listings often focus on cultural life of New York City, The New Yorker has a wide audience outside of New York and USA. It is well known in its commentaries on popular culture and eccentric Americana; its attention to modern fiction by the inclusion of short stories and literary reviews; its rigorous fact checking and copyediting; its journalism on world politics and social issues; and its famous, single-panel cartoons sprinkled throughout each issue","last_updated":"2017-09-06T12:01:29.312Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:781ed1f9e42e21fc00d6c0deec4e895c94638dbe","dn":"The New Yorker - September 11, 2017 - True PDF - zeke23","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"781ed1f9e42e21fc00d6c0deec4e895c94638dbe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,30,209,249,228,46,33,252,0,214,192,222,236,78,137,92,148,99,141,190]},"name":"The New Yorker - September 11, 2017 - True PDF - zeke23","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
