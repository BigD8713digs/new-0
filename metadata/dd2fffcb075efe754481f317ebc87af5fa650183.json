But when Jenna arrived late, she found that Celia had disappeared - and she hasn&apos;t been seen again. Jenna has blamed herself for her friend&apos;s disappearance every single day since then.\r\n\r\nThe only piece of evidence is a lone diamond earring found where Celia and Jenna were planning to meet, leading the national media to dub Celia &quot;The Diamond Mom&quot;. And even though Jenna has obsessively surfed message boards devoted to missing persons cases, she is no closer to finding any answers - or easing her guilt. But when her son&apos;s new girlfriend - who suddenly arrived in town without a past - disappears, a stricken Jenna begins to unwind the tangled truth behind Celia&apos;s tragedy. And as long-buried secrets finally come to light, she discovers how completely lives can be shattered by a few simple lies.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-12-30T12:03:24.113Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd2fffcb075efe754481f317ebc87af5fa650183","dn":"Since She Went Away by David Bell EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"dd2fffcb075efe754481f317ebc87af5fa650183","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,47,255,203,7,94,254,117,68,129,243,23,235,200,122,245,250,101,1,131]},"name":"Since She Went Away by David Bell EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
