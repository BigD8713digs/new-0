It is essentially a server-side scripting language. PHP 7 is the latest version, providing major backward-compatibility breaks and focusing on improved performance and speed.\r\n\r\nThis course follows a learning path which is divided into three modules. Each module is a mini course in its own right, taking your basic PHP programing skills to the next level by showing you intermediate to advanced PHP techniques with a focus on PHP 7. This way, get you equipped with the tools and skills required to develop professional and efficient applications for your websites and enterprises.\r\n\r\nThe first module of the book is a programming cookbook that consists over 80 recipes! Each recipe is designed to solve practical, real-world problems faced by PHP developers like yourself every day. This course also covers new ways of writing PHP code made possible only in version 7.\r\n\r\nThe second module of the course is designed to improve the performance and productivity of your application. We&#x2019;ll introduce you to the concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in PHP 7, then shed some light on how to improve the performance of your PHP 7 applications and database. Throughout this module you will be introduced to benchmarking tools.\r\n\r\nWith all important concepts of PHP covered up you will move on to third module. In this module you will gain a deep insight into the modular programming paradigm and how to achieve modularity in your PHP code. Modular design techniques help you build readable, manageable, reusable, and more efficient codes. PHP 7, which is a popular open source scripting language, is used to build modular functions for your software","last_updated":"2017-06-15T12:01:58.064Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac820ba8b1261101a45b58260adb27ae31594dfb","dn":"PHP 7: Real World Application Development by Altaf Hussain, Bran","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"ac820ba8b1261101a45b58260adb27ae31594dfb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,130,11,168,177,38,17,1,164,91,88,38,10,219,39,174,49,89,77,251]},"name":"PHP 7: Real World Application Development by Altaf Hussain, Bran","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
