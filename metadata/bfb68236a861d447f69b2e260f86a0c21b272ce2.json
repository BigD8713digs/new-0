Filming them is tough - elephants are one of the most dangerous animals on earth thanks to years of human persecution. With the help of local expert Benjamin Kyalo, Gordon manages to get spectacularly close to the elephants on foot. And he witnesses at first hand the dangers baby Wiva faces growing up in the African bush.\r\n\r\n2)  Part 2 \r\nGordon Buchanan returns to Kenya to follow baby elephant Wiva and her family in the height of the dry season.\r\nThe birth of a new baby, Gawa, prompts an extraordinary celebration. But will Wiva be left out in the cold now that there is a new baby in town? Gordon follows the family through the African bush, experiencing the challenges they face in their fight for survival.\r\n\r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Container: mkv\r\n * Video Bitrate: 6594 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\n * Video Resolution: 1920x1080\r\n * Frame Rate: 25 FPS\r\n * Audio Codec: AC-3\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 192 kb/s\r\n * Audio Channels: 2\r\n * Run-Time: 58 mins / part\r\n * Number of Parts: 2\r\n * Part Size: 2.79 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV","last_updated":"2017-11-23T12:02:16.991Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:bfb68236a861d447f69b2e260f86a0c21b272ce2","dn":"BBC Gordon Buchanan Elephant Family and Me 2of2 2016 1080i MVGro","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"bfb68236a861d447f69b2e260f86a0c21b272ce2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,182,130,54,168,97,212,71,246,155,46,38,15,134,160,194,27,39,44,226]},"name":"BBC Gordon Buchanan Elephant Family and Me 2of2 2016 1080i MVGro","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
