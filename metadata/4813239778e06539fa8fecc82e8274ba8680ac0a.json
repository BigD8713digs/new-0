Men and women, it revealed, communicate so differently, we might as well be from different planets. By learning to speak each other&apos;s language, millions of people dramatically improved, even saved their relationships.\r\n\r\nBut the world has changed.\r\n\r\nToday, what it means to be a man or a woman is more nuanced and complex than ever. Both men and women are now freer to move beyond the restrictions of traditional gender roles to embrace their authentic selves.\r\n\r\nBut gender freedom shouldn&apos;t mean gender blindness. Men and women are still fundamentally different on a hormonal level. Our new needs in today&apos;s evolving and stressful fast-paced world - to remain healthy and happy hormonally and in the context of our relationships - are also fundamentally different.\r\n\r\nAs the roles of men and women evolve, relationships must evolve as well. To meet our new needs, we require a new kind of relationship.\r\n\r\nIn Beyond Mars and Venus, Gray takes the Mars-Venus framework to the next level, helping listeners to grow together in love. Through real-life examples and simple exercises, Beyond Mars and Venus shows you how to bring you and your partner closer than ever before","last_updated":"2017-05-25T10:50:13.675Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:4813239778e06539fa8fecc82e8274ba8680ac0a","dn":"John Gray - Beyond Mars and Venus 2017 RETAiL ePUB eBOOK-DiSTRiB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"4813239778e06539fa8fecc82e8274ba8680ac0a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,19,35,151,120,224,101,57,250,143,236,200,46,130,116,186,134,128,172,10]},"name":"John Gray - Beyond Mars and Venus 2017 RETAiL ePUB eBOOK-DiSTRiB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
