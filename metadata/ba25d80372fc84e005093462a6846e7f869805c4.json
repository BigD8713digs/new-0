These new features make the game much more interesting and unpredictable. The game can be played either against a computer or human opponents (on the same PC) on several playing tables. Training mode is available. The billiard game uses modern 3D scene building technology. The speed of the game largely depends on the capacity of your video chipset. In order to optimize game performance, multiple options are available. The game allows for playing in various settings, some of which might be unusual, and players&apos; roles. The program comes with a powerful anti-aliasing algorithm for the cue and balls, which minimizes video card resources required, freeing them to be used by other parts of the program. Download the billiard game and check your skills!","last_updated":"2018-06-07T12:06:55.926Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba25d80372fc84e005093462a6846e7f869805c4","dn":"Pool Cueshot","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"ba25d80372fc84e005093462a6846e7f869805c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,37,216,3,114,252,132,224,5,9,52,98,166,132,110,127,134,152,5,196]},"name":"Pool Cueshot","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
