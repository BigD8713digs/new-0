At thirty years old, Gabriel Wyner speaks six languages fluently.  He didn&#x2019;t learn them in school -- who does? -- rather, he learned them in the past few years, working on his own and practicing on the subway, using simple techniques and free online resources. In Fluent Forever Wyner reveals what he&#x2019;s discovered.  \r\n \r\nThe greatest challenge to learning a foreign language is the challenge of memory; there are just too many words and too many rules. For every new word we learn, we seem to forget two old ones, and as a result, fluency can seem out of reach. Fluent Forever tackles this challenge head-on. With empathy for the language-challenged and abundant humor, Wyner deconstructs the learning process, revealing how to build a foreign language in your mind from the ground up. \r\n\r\n\r\nPaperback: 336 pages\r\nPublisher: Harmony (5 August 2014)\r\nLanguage: English\r\nISBN-10: 0385348118\r\nISBN-13: 978-0385348119","last_updated":"2018-09-09T12:22:22.879Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:e89f429d92ecdbbee937f642ece17e28986caf89","dn":"How to Learn Any Language Fast Never Forget It Fluent Forever","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"e89f429d92ecdbbee937f642ece17e28986caf89","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,159,66,157,146,236,219,190,233,55,246,66,236,225,126,40,152,108,175,137]},"name":"How to Learn Any Language Fast Never Forget It Fluent Forever","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
