Thank you so much for downloading and seeding this collection of random oldies for others to enjoy.\r\n\r\nSinger Songwriters and Musician&apos;s, this was for YOU, for you do not know what you are doing in Life until you see what others have done for you before.\r\n\r\nI am 68 years young this year, so not sure if there will be a Rigmar Radio Oldies collection to seed in 5 or 6 years time when I normally make up a new torrent collection.  My last one was posted in 2010, so this could be the last.\r\n\r\nWithout the community supporting this series like myself it will die.\r\n\r\nRigmar Radio - Still Rockin&apos; the World for now","last_updated":"2017-09-28T12:01:58.507Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:47bc8ef3cd3ae89646f7982a3b452d3052f03f47","dn":"Rigmar Audio Collection 042 of 042","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"47bc8ef3cd3ae89646f7982a3b452d3052f03f47","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,188,142,243,205,58,232,150,70,247,152,42,59,69,45,48,82,240,63,71]},"name":"Rigmar Audio Collection 042 of 042","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
