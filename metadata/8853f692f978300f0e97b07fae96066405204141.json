Nearly one thousand people were killed, looting was widespread, and torch-bearing protestors marched on the Prime Minister&apos;s residence at 10 Downing Street. These were the Gordon Riots: the worst civil disturbance in British history, triggered by an act of Parliament designed to loosen two centuries of systemic oppression of Catholics in the British Isles. While many London Catholics saw their homes ransacked and chapels desecrated, the riots marked a crucial turning point in their fight to return to public life.\r\n\r\nGenre: Non-Fiction &gt; History","last_updated":"2018-09-26T12:26:40.868Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:8853f692f978300f0e97b07fae96066405204141","dn":"The King and the Catholics by Antonia Fraser (.epub)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"8853f692f978300f0e97b07fae96066405204141","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,83,246,146,249,120,48,15,14,151,176,127,174,150,6,100,5,32,65,65]},"name":"The King and the Catholics by Antonia Fraser (.epub)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
