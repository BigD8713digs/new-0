Why are they doing this if, as politicians and clergy keep assuring us, Islam is a religion of peace? We are sure these questions are being asked in most homes. Your questions are answered in this book.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that Islam is a religion of war, and the educated elite in the West have had proof of this for over 150 years. But since 9/11 they have been actively deceiving the rest of the population &#x2013; because the elite dare not tackle the problem. Our journalists have totally failed in their function to challenge and correct the lies of politicians. So, the problem with Islam in the West has grown worse every year since the early 1990s. There is no sign that anything will be done to stop this until ordinary people take it upon themselves to understand Islam and expose the lies which paralyse the West&#x2BC;s discussions of Islam.\r\n\r\nThis book provides you with a revolutionary way to understand Islam: you can understand the Koran within minutes instead of months. You will have concrete evidence that any part of the Koran which appears peaceful has been cancelled by a later command to be violent. You will see Islam&#x2BC;s hatred and contempt for non-Muslims laid bare. When teachers indoctrinate your children or force them to attend a mosque, use our book to shame these educators for their part in the deception. After reading this book you will understand the threat facing your children&#x2BC;s future and you will have the knowledge to make politicians find some backbone","last_updated":"2017-08-09T12:00:27.937Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:c182032565b4f81110532af7b81b2feb437a5a68","dn":"Mohammed's Koran - Why Muslims Kill For Islam (2017) Gooner","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"c182032565b4f81110532af7b81b2feb437a5a68","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,130,3,37,101,180,248,17,16,83,42,247,184,27,47,235,67,122,90,104]},"name":"Mohammed's Koran - Why Muslims Kill For Islam (2017) Gooner","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
