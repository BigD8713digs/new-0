With the creation of incredible technologies such as space probes, giant ground-based telescopes, and Earth-orbiting observatories, we&apos;ve learned that Mars once had water on its surface, that Jupiter&apos;s Great Red Spot has been churning for centuries, and that thousands of exoplanets circle distant suns. Planetary science is also exciting because of what we don&apos;t know.\r\nPlanets, those pinpricks of light you might spot on a clear night, come closer through informative illustrations, links to online primary sources, illuminating sidebars and fun facts, and hands-on, in-depth activities, such as building scale models of planets, hunting for alien worlds through citizen science, and crafting a comet in the kitchen. Planetary Science also promotes critical thinking skills through inquiry, discovery, and research by encouraging readers to explore questions that remain unanswered, such as whether Mars once had life or the possibility of a ninth planet hiding in the furthest reaches of the solar system. With discoveries being made almost every day, it&apos;s an exciting time to be a planetary scientist!\r\n\r\nAbout the author <a href=\"\nhttps://s1.postimg.org/21u8ufbgj3/Marhew.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://s1.postimg.org/21u8ufbgj3/Marhew.jpg</a>\r\nMatthew Brenden Wood is a math and science teacher with a passion for STEAM education.
