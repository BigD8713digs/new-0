RELEASE.DATE .. PROTECTION .......: Securom/Crap/EA\r\n1 :.......... DISC(S) .. GAME.TYPE ........: Sports\r\n\r\nFIFA 13 captures all the drama and unpredictability of real-world soccer,\r\nand is driven by five game-changing innovations which revolutionize\r\nartificial intelligence, dribbling, ball control and physical play. It is\r\nthe largest and deepest feature set in the history of the franchise. These\r\ninnovations create a true battle for possession across the entire pitch,\r\ndeliver freedom and creativity in attack, and capture all the drama and\r\nunpredictability of the real-world game\r\n\r\nFEATURES\r\nAttacking Intelligence - Players have the ability to analyse space, work\r\nharder and smarter to break down the defense, and think two plays ahead\r\nPlus, players make runs that pull defenders out of position and open passing\r\nchannels for teammates\r\n\r\nComplete Dribbling - Face your opponent and use precise dribble touches\r\ncombined with true 360-degree mobility with the ball. Be more creative and\r\ndangerous in 1v1 opportunities\r\n\r\n1st Touch Control - A new system transforms the way players control the\r\nball, eliminating near-perfect touch for every player, and creating more\r\nopportunities for defenders to capitalise on errant balls and poor touches\r\nto win back possession\r\n\r\n1.
