The rich are getting richer by rigging the system in their favor, leaving the rest of us to struggle just to keep our heads above water. To save the American Dream, we&apos;re told that we need to fight inequality through tax hikes, wealth redistribution schemes, and a far higher minimum wage.\r\n\r\nBut what if that narrative is wrong? What if the real threat to the American Dream isn&apos;t rising income inequality - but an all-out war on success?\r\n\r\nIn this timely and thought-provoking work, Don Watkins and Yaron Brook reveal that almost everything we&apos;ve been taught about inequality is wrong. You&apos;ll discover:\r\n\r\nWhy successful CEOs make so much money - and deserve to\r\nHow the minimum wage hurts the very people it claims to help\r\nWhy middle-class stagnation is a myth\r\nHow the little-known history of Sweden reveals the dangers of forced equality\r\nThe disturbing philosophy behind Obama&apos;s economic agenda.\r\n\r\nThe critics of inequality are right about one thing: The American Dream is under attack. But instead of fighting to make America a place where anyone can achieve success, they are fighting to tear down those who already have. The real key to making America a freer, fairer, more prosperous nation is to protect and celebrate the pursuit of success - not pull down the high fliers in the name of equality.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-01-25T12:11:45.542Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:77ba618a2ae1729d27f862fa85d80a12dca68ffb","dn":"Equal Is Unfair by Don Watkins, Yaron Brook EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"77ba618a2ae1729d27f862fa85d80a12dca68ffb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,186,97,138,42,225,114,157,39,248,98,250,133,216,10,18,220,166,143,251]},"name":"Equal Is Unfair by Don Watkins, Yaron Brook EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
