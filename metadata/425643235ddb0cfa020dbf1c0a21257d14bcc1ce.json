Done correctly, it can be a way to radically encounter bliss and to begin - and sustain - real transformation in ourselves.\r\n\r\nIn Mindfulness, Bliss, and Beyond, self-described meditation junkie Ajahn Brahm shares his knowledge and experience of the jhanas - a core part of the Buddha&apos;s original meditation teaching. Never before has this material been approached in such an empowering way, by a teacher of such authority and popularity.\r\n\r\nFull of surprises, delightfully goofy humor, and entertaining stories that inspire, instruct, and illuminate, Mindfulness, Bliss, and Beyond will encourage those new to meditation, and give a shot in the arm to more experienced practitioners as well.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-08-31T12:00:38.718Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:425643235ddb0cfa020dbf1c0a21257d14bcc1ce","dn":"Mindfulness, Bliss, and Beyond_ A Meditator's Handbook by Ajahn ","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"425643235ddb0cfa020dbf1c0a21257d14bcc1ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,86,67,35,93,219,12,250,2,13,191,28,10,33,37,125,20,188,193,206]},"name":"Mindfulness, Bliss, and Beyond_ A Meditator's Handbook by Ajahn ","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
