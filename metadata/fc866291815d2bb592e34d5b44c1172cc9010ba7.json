Together, we have taught Photoshop to thousands of students, both in traditional classrooms and online. In our 20+ years of teaching Photoshop, we have learned first hand from our students which Photoshop skills they feel are the most essential, and also which Photoshop techniques they find the most difficult to master. We have used our students&#x2019; feedback to determine the topics, their sequence, and the step by step tutorials.\r\n\r\nOur Adobe Photoshop training is divided into two courses of hands-on tutorials:\r\n\r\n    Practical Photoshop CC 2015, Level 1\r\n    Versions available for both CC 2015 and CC 2015.5!\r\n    Practical Photoshop CC 2015, Level 2\r\n\r\nThe projects and the theory behind the two course series maps to both a full year&apos;s Photoshop instruction at the college level and also to the exam objectives for Adobe&apos;s industry-standard certification: Visual Communication with Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Certified Associate). The courses have also been used successfully for high school enrichment and home-schooled students","last_updated":"2017-07-29T12:00:24.754Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc866291815d2bb592e34d5b44c1172cc9010ba7","dn":"Practical Photoshop - Issue 77 - August 2017 - True PDF - zeke23","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"fc866291815d2bb592e34d5b44c1172cc9010ba7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,134,98,145,129,93,43,181,146,227,77,91,68,193,23,44,201,1,11,167]},"name":"Practical Photoshop - Issue 77 - August 2017 - True PDF - zeke23","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
