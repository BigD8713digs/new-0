Working as brush cutters, these 21st-century lumberjacks discover Quebec&apos;s boreal forest. Far from their families, they spend 5 or 6 months a year in logging camps that mirror a new Quebec, those of French-Canadian descent and neo-Quebecers from Africa, Eastern Europe and Asia. All have come to earn a living in the forest. Filmmaker St&#xE9;phanie Lanthier invites us to spend an entire season inside this northern micro society. Using a direct cinema technique in the style of Pierre Perrault, she documents the lives of the brush cutters","last_updated":"2017-08-06T12:03:34.243Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:6393857c293b19d4a5c28425247140b872c7442c","dn":"NFB - The Lumberfros.mp4","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"6393857c293b19d4a5c28425247140b872c7442c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,147,133,124,41,59,25,212,165,194,132,37,36,113,64,184,114,199,68,44]},"name":"NFB - The Lumberfros.mp4","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
