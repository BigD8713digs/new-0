Unlike a number of existing textbooks for this course, this one focuses not only on CPU architecture, but also covers in great detail in system buses, peripherals and memories.\r\nThis book teaches every element in a computing system in two steps. First, it introduces the functionality of each topic (and subtopics) and then goes into &quot;from-scratch design&quot; of a particular digital block from its architectural specifications using timing diagrams. The author describes how the data-path of a certain digital block is generated using timing diagrams, a method which most textbooks do not cover, but is valuable in actual practice. In the end, the user is ready to use both the design methodology and the basic computing building blocks presented in the book to be able to produce industrial-strength designs","last_updated":"2017-08-05T12:00:46.289Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:039669778f13c75a5d8ff910cfb8c5aed1c15d1c","dn":"Fundamentals of Computer Architecture and Design(2017) - PDF - z","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"039669778f13c75a5d8ff910cfb8c5aed1c15d1c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,150,105,119,143,19,199,90,93,143,249,16,207,184,197,174,209,193,93,28]},"name":"Fundamentals of Computer Architecture and Design(2017) - PDF - z","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
