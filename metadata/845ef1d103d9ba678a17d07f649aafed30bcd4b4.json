The Spies of Winter explores the early years of GCHQ as it navigated its way through a tumultuous era - from the defection of the Cambridge Five and the treachery of atomic scientist Klaus Fuchs to the collapse of the British Empire and the emergence of the US as a superpower. This is the story of the codebreakers themselves, and how they expanded the horizons of cryptography, helping to defend the nation and maintain the fragile peace in a world now under the shadow of nuclear holocaust.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-09-02T12:05:39.879Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:845ef1d103d9ba678a17d07f649aafed30bcd4b4","dn":"The Spies of Winter_ The GCHQ Codebreakers Who Fought the Cold W","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"845ef1d103d9ba678a17d07f649aafed30bcd4b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,94,241,209,3,217,186,103,138,23,208,127,100,154,175,237,48,188,212,180]},"name":"The Spies of Winter_ The GCHQ Codebreakers Who Fought the Cold W","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
