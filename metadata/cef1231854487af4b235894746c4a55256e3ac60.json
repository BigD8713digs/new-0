(Love And Peace Dude, later Laughing As People Die) was an American funk metal band formed in 1989 in Bakersfield, California. From 1989 to 1991, the member line-up was James Shaffer, Reginald Arvizu, David Silveria and Richard Morrill. The group has released one studio album, one extended play, and one compilation album.\r\n\r\nThe group left Bakersfield and set out for Los Angeles, California. Shaffer was the only band member that was not in favor of the act. He was the only one to stay in Bakersfield, while all the other band members left. Silveria dropped out of high school to leave Bakersfield. L.A.P.D. began rehearsing at a space located in Hollywood, California, near Western Avenue. Shaffer decided to return to the band when he and his girlfriend broke up. Brian Welch, a guitarist who knew Shaffer and Arvizu when they were in high school (and who later joined the band when they reformed as Korn), would occasionally &quot;check out the [band&apos;s] music scene.\r\n\r\nTracklist\r\n\r\n\r\n01 - P.M.S..mp3\r\n02 - Don&apos;t Label Me.mp3\r\n03 - St. Ides.mp3\r\n04 - All My Life.mp3\r\n05 - Who&apos;s Got the Number.mp3\r\n06 - Excuse Me.mp3\r\n07 - Listen (Do What I Say).mp3\r\n08 - Doe Tee Beat.mp3\r\n09 - Slicky Slixter.mp3\r\n10 - Place in France.mp3\r\n11 - Number 7.mp3\r\n12 - James Brown.mp3\r\n13 - Jesus.mp3\r\n14 - Stinging Like a Bee.mp3\r\n\r\n\r\nPlayers\r\n\r\nMembers\r\n\r\nName \tYears active \tPosition \tRef\r\n\r\nJames Shaffer \t        1989&#x2013;1992 \tguitar \t\r\nReginald Arvizu \t1989&#x2013;1992 \tbass \t\r\nDavid Silveria \t         1989&#x2013;1992 \tdrums \t\r\nRichard Morrill    \t1989&#x2013;1992      vocals\r\n\t \t\r\nPete Capra \t        1989&#x2013;1991 \tvocals \t\r\nCorey \t                1992 \t        vocals\r\n\r\nIf anybody stayed They Joined KoRn","last_updated":"2017-09-06T12:00:31.671Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:cef1231854487af4b235894746c4a55256e3ac60","dn":"L.A.P.D. - L.A.P.D. 1997 ak320  Pre(KoRn)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"cef1231854487af4b235894746c4a55256e3ac60","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,241,35,24,84,72,122,244,178,53,137,71,70,196,165,82,86,227,172,96]},"name":"L.A.P.D. - L.A.P.D. 1997 ak320  Pre(KoRn)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
