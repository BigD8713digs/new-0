Rubakov, Dmitry S. Gorbunov\r\nWorld Scientific Publishing Company | June 2017 | ISBN: 9813209887 |  ePUB | 55.8 mb\r\n\r\nThis book is written from the viewpoint that a deep connection exists between cosmology and particle physics. It presents the results and ideas on both the homogeneous and isotropic Universe at the hot stage of its evolution and in later stages. The main chapters describe in a systematic and pedagogical way established facts and concepts on the early and the present Universe. The comprehensive treatment, hence, serves as a modern introduction to this rapidly developing field of science. To help in reading the chapters without having to constantly consult other texts, essential materials from General Relativity and the theory of elementary particles are collected in the appendices. Various hypotheses dealing with unsolved problems of cosmology, and often alternative to each other, are discussed at a more advanced level. These concern dark matter, dark energy, matter&#x2013;antimatter asymmetry, etc.\r\nParticle physics and cosmology underwent rapid development between the first and the second editions of this book. In the second edition, many chapters and sections have been revised, and numerical values of particle physics and cosmological parameters have been updated.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\nPreface to the 2nd Edition\r\nPreface to the 1st Edition\r\n1.Cosmology: A Preview\r\n2.Homogeneous Isotropic Universe\r\n3.Dynamics of Cosmological Expansion\r\n4.?CDM: Cosmological Model with Dark Matter and Dark Energy\r\n5.Thermodynamics in Expanding Universe\r\n6.Recombination\r\n7.Relic Neutrino\r\n8.Big Bang Nucleosynthesis\r\n9.Dark Matter\r\n10.Phase Transitions in the Early Universe\r\n11.Generation of Baryon Asymmetr\r\n12.Topological Defects and Solitons in the Universe\r\n13.Color Pages\r\nAppendix AElements of General Relativity\r\nAppendix BStandard Model of Particle PhysicS\r\nAppendix CNeutrino OscillationS\r\nAppendix DQuantum Field Theory at Finite Temperature\r\nBibliography\r\nBooks and Reviews\r\nIndex\r\n <a href=\"\nhttps://s26.postimg.org/snx5oum9l/Introduction_to_the_Theory_of_the_Early_Universe.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://s26.postimg.org/snx5oum9l/Introduction_to_the_Theory_of_the_Early_Universe.jpg</a>","last_updated":"2017-08-31T12:06:27.035Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:415ab87583aa658775ab246385f62161f27985ff","dn":"Introduction to the Theory of the Early Universe (2nd Ed)(gnv64)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"415ab87583aa658775ab246385f62161f27985ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,90,184,117,131,170,101,135,117,171,36,99,133,246,33,97,242,121,133,255]},"name":"Introduction to the Theory of the Early Universe (2nd Ed)(gnv64)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
