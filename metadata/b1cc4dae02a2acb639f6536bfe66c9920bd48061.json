A total of 252 species is described here in detail, from the Black-rumped Flameback to the Ceylon Blue Magpie. All of these birds are clearly illustrated in a collection of specially commissioned colour photographs. With almost 300 full-colour photographs, easy-to-use thumbnail family silhouettes, a regional distribution map and handy tips on the best birding localities.\r\nIllustrated with clear colour photography and brief but authoritative descriptions the Pocket Photo Guides highlight the species of birds and animals from each region that the traveller is most likely to see, as well as those that are genuinely endemic (only to be seen in that country or region) or special rarities. The genuine pocket size allow the books to be carried around on trips and excursions and will take up minimal rucksack and suitcase space.\r\n\r\nAbout the Authors\r\nGehan de Silva Wijeyeratne has authored over three hundred articles for international newspapers and magazines on Sri Lankan biodiversity, travel, and business, as well as fifteen books.\r\nDeepal Warakagoda is a Sri Lankan ornithologist and a professional guide for birding tours.
