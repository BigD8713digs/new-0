The key is balance: using essential daily practices for the mind, body, and soul. The Badass Life is her monthlong program based on building positive daily habits, to help you achieve a higher quality of life and a heightened sense of self-worth.\r\n\r\nIt takes 30 days to break a bad habit and 30 days to create a good one. Christmas provides a daily challenge for your mental, physical, and spiritual awareness to help you develop positive thinking and successful behavior and boost your brainpower. Each day is centered around a specific &quot;action theme&quot;, such as &quot;Eliminate Excuses&quot;, &quot;Lean on Mentors&quot;, and &quot;Feel Sexy, Be Sexy&quot;. Christmas shows you how to create a better blueprint for your daily habits to maximize their beneficial effects and includes suggestions for healthy eating, fun puzzles, life questions, and brain teasers to get you thinking in new directions. Christmas also emphasizes the need for daily spiritual wellness and gives you ideas for practicing intended acts of connection, such as helping a complete stranger unconditionally, setting specific intentions, and recording what you appreciate about yourself.\r\n\r\nNo matter your level of health well-being, The Badass Life will help you channel the power of the mind-body-spirit connection to become your best self in every way.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-10-27T12:07:49.957Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:81d100d3c01bbb86f48ebb51b7b8c76a10450e6e","dn":"The Badass Life by Christmas Abbott EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"81d100d3c01bbb86f48ebb51b7b8c76a10450e6e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,209,0,211,192,27,187,134,244,142,187,81,183,184,199,106,16,69,14,110]},"name":"The Badass Life by Christmas Abbott EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
