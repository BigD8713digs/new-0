Chen EPUB\r\n\r\nKangaroo isn&apos;t your typical spy. Sure, he has extensive agency training, access to bleeding-edge technology, and a ready supply of clever (to him) quips and retorts. But what sets him apart is &quot;the pocket&quot;. It&apos;s a portal that opens into an empty, seemingly infinite parallel universe, and Kangaroo is the only person in the world who can use it. But he&apos;s pretty sure the agency keeps him around only to exploit his superpower.\r\n\r\nAfter he bungles yet another mission, Kangaroo gets sent away on a mandatory &quot;vacation&quot;: an interplanetary cruise to Mars. While he tries to make the most of his exile, two passengers are found dead, and Kangaroo has to risk blowing his cover. It turns out he isn&apos;t the only spy on the ship - and he&apos;s just starting to unravel a massive conspiracy that threatens the entire solar system.\r\n\r\nNow Kangaroo has to stop a disaster that would shatter the delicate peace that&apos;s existed between Earth and Mars ever since the brutal Martian Independence War. A new interplanetary conflict would be devastating for both sides. Millions of lives are at stake.\r\n\r\nWeren&apos;t vacations supposed to be relaxing?\r\n\r\nWith Waypoint Kangaroo, Chen makes his debut with this outer space thriller. Chen has an extensive network of connections to prominent science fiction authors and has studied under John Scalzi, James Patrick Kelly, and Ursula K. LeGuin.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-11-06T12:04:58.271Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:eed71884289456c092c1846f09cc19b236dd8130","dn":"Waypoint Kangaroo by Curtis C.
