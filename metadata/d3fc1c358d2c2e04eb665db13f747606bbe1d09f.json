Structured in five sections contrasting home and war, the film opens in Clairton, PA, as Mike (Robert De Niro), Nick (Christopher Walken), and Stan (John Cazale, in his last film) celebrate the wedding of their friend Steve (John Savage) and go on a final deer hunt before the men leave for Vietnam. Mike treats hunting as a test of skill, lecturing Stan about the value of &quot;one shot&quot; deer slaying and brushing off Nick&apos;s urgings to appreciate nature&apos;s beauty. As Mike ruminates post-hunt, the film cuts to the horror of Vietnam, where the men are captured by Vietcong soldiers who force Mike and Nick to play Russian roulette for the V.C.&apos;s amusement. Mike turns the game to his advantage so they can escape captivity, but the men are permanently scarred by the episode. Steve loses his legs; Nick vanishes in the Saigon Russian roulette parlors. Mike returns alone to Clairton a changed man, as he rejects the killing of the deer hunt and finds solace with Nick&apos;s old girlfriend Linda (Meryl Streep). Disgusted by the antics of his male cohorts at home, Mike decides to bring Steve back from a veterans&apos; hospital, and he returns to Saigon to find Nick. As Saigon falls, Mike discovers how far gone Nick is; the survivors gather in Clairton for a funeral breakfast, singing an impromptu rendition of &quot;God Bless America.&quot;\r\n\r\n\r\nSTARS.........: Robert De Niro, Christopher Walken, Meryl Streep, John Cazale\r\nDIRECTOR......: Michael Cimino\r\nWRITERS.......: Michael Cimino, Deric Washburn\r\nGENRE.........: War, Drama\r\nMETASCORE.....: 81\r\nTOMATOMETER...: 94\r\nIMDB RATING...: 8.1/10  273,676 votes\r\nIMDB LINK.....: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077416\r\nRUNTIME.......: 3h 03mn\r\nSIZE..........: 6.83 GB\r\nVIDEO CODEC...: HEVC (Main@L4)\r\nBITRATE.......: 4500 Kbps (2-pass)\r\nRESOLUTION....: 1920x816\r\nASPECT RATIO..: 2.35:1\r\nFRAMERATE.....: 23.976 fps\r\nAUDIO1........: English E-AC3 5.1 640kbps\r\nAUDIO2........: Commentary by Michael Cimino\r\nAUDIO3........: Vilmos Zsigmond and film journalist Bob Fisher\r\nSUBTITLES.....: ENG\r\nCHAPTERS......: Yes\r\nSOURCE........: HDDVD\r\nENCODED BY....: Sartre\r\nENCODE DATE...: 2018-10-02\r\nENCODE NOTE...: The HDDVD sports a better PQ than any Blu-ray release so far, IMO","last_updated":"2018-10-06T12:11:07.612Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3fc1c358d2c2e04eb665db13f747606bbe1d09f","dn":"The.Deer.Hunter.1978.1080p.HDDVD.x265.HEVC.EAC3-SARTRE","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"d3fc1c358d2c2e04eb665db13f747606bbe1d09f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,252,28,53,141,44,46,4,235,102,93,177,63,116,118,6,187,225,208,159]},"name":"The.Deer.Hunter.1978.1080p.HDDVD.x265.HEVC.EAC3-SARTRE","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
