Appearing as a virus, completely without symptoms and seemingly benign, Trident quickly infects the world&#x2019;s population. Silently it waits, counting down to the moment when it will reveal its true, terrifying nature.\r\nIt is only weeks before the presidential elections, and Garrison Fox, a decorated Marine and devoted husband and father, is almost assured of a return to the White House for a second term. As the campaign nears its final days, the First Family finds itself scattered across the U.S.\r\nAt an Ohio rally and across the globe, Trident suddenly unleashes its horrible power, transforming unsuspecting people into merciless killers driven to feed. When an infected Secret Service turns on him, President Fox is forced to flee across an America plunging deeper into savagery with each passing hour.\r\nIn Atlanta, a CDC researcher will work against her own mortality in an effort to stop an extinction-level event. In Pennsylvania, a newly commissioned second lieutenant is hurled into a war for which he was never trained. And moving east toward a secure mountain bunker, President Fox must find a way to save his family, his country and his own life&#x2026;if he&#x2019;s not already too late","last_updated":"2017-11-11T12:03:00.118Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed26a1743067c11d19fea3d56855a3e8da5b7491","dn":"John L.
