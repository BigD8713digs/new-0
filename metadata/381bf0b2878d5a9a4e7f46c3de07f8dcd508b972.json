This is a real collectors item.\r\nFull artwork for all 22 cd&apos;s included. All preserved in great quality FLAC.\r\n\r\nExcellent stuff, really recommended.Use the tags to find more excellent music.  \r\n\r\nPlease enjoy, share with friends and please seed :)\r\n\r\nI use fast servers but also need your help, there&apos;s too much downloaders to handle.\r\n\r\nStuff like this needs to be preserved for future generations of music lovers.\r\n\r\nThanks to all the peers from everywhere seeding my huge archive, i love you!\r\n============================================================================\r\n\r\nThe Complete Lost Lennon Tapes\r\n22 CD&apos;s packaged as 11 double CD sets\r\nReleased on the WALRUS label between 1996 and 1998\r\n\r\nNoticed that the artwork and the actual CD&apos;s didn&apos;t always match.\r\nThought I might fix that someday. These files sat on my computer for a couple years and finally became my new project.\r\n\r\nDecided to begin with tagging each track with &quot;song and details&quot; and that was when a small project got much much bigger. Turns out that MANY of these discs were not tracked as shown on the CD artwork?!!?\r\nSome medley&apos;s were separated (or some combined) but the art work would show otherwise. In other places 2 songs were in one track but the artwork showed separate tracks. A couple songs listed on the artwork were not even on that disc? Very odd but this is how it was.\r\n\r\nDecided to modify the track splits to follow the artwork.\r\nAudacity, CD Wave and Traders Little Helper were used to make the modifications and new fingerprints.\r\n\r\nIn the case of medley&apos;s being split-up on the disc but not the cover there were 2 second gaps between songs.\r\nThese gaps were removed and the waveforms reconnected to be one track and follow the artwork.\r\nA couple of the discs are now shorter because of this.\r\n\r\nOther times there were multiple songs in a single track that were split apart.\r\nTracks were renumbered as needed.\r\n\r\nCertain covers also had minor typos and needed to be modified to fit the content on the disc.\r\nWindows Paint was used (copy and paste) to make those repairs.\r\nNot all &quot;time&quot; notations are accurate after these changes but at least the discs match the covers now.\r\n\r\nSome discs split up recordings with added silence that should have been continuous (the 20 track birthday tape for instance).\r\nThe 2-3 second gaps between each track have been removed for an improved flow and some discs are now shorter because of this.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt became a real labor of love to complete these modifications and then listen to each disc to verify everything is correct now.\r\n\r\n\r\nHope you can set the time aside to listen to all of these discs too.\r\nIt is a lot of music to go through and spans nearly 25 hours\r\n\r\nThese tracks are not comparable to the officially released versions but are a wonderful peak at John&apos;s art being created.\r\nNot always flattering to his hero singer image.\r\nYou can bet that John had no intention that this material would ever be heard by anyone else.\r\n\r\nThat said these should not be listened to casually as you will miss so much.\r\nMake it a habit to discover a new disc every Sunday morning.\r\nHave a cup of coffee and then listen with headphones before anyone else wakes up.\r\nTurn it up so you really get to be part of the sessions.\r\nVery educational to listen to all of these different composition tapes.\r\nEnlightening.\r\n\r\nThanks to Yoko (did I actually just say that?) for these tapes that she shared with John&apos;s fans for free.\r\nA truly classy thing to do.\r\nThe Lost Lennon Tapes radio show was on every Sunday for almost 3 years.\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Lennon\r\nThe Complete Lost Lennon Tapes\r\nVolumes 1 &amp; 2\r\n(Walrus 002/003)\r\n\r\n\r\nVolume 1\r\n01.
