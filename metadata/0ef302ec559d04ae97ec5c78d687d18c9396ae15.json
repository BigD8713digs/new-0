Spanning the late &apos;30s and early &apos;40s, the movie introduces us to Hong Kong teen Wong Chia Chi (Tang Wei), a shy college freshman who finds her calling in a drama society devoted to patriotic plays. But the troupe&apos;s leader, Kuang Yu Min (Wang Leehom), isn&apos;t just a theater maven -- he&apos;s a revolutionary as well, and he&apos;s devoted to carrying out a bold plan to assassinate top Japanese collaborator Mr. Yee. Each student has an important role to play, and Wong puts herself in a dangerous position as Mrs. Mak; she befriends Mr. Yee&apos;s wife (Joan Chen), and slowly gains trust before tempting him into an affair. While at first the plan goes exactly as scripted, things suddenly take a deadly turn and Wong is emigrated from Hong Kong. Later, in 1941, the occupation shows no signs of ceasing and Wong is simply drifting through her days in Shanghai. Much to her surprise, the former actress finds Kuang requesting that she resume the role of Mrs. Mak. Now, as Wong again gains intimate access to her dangerous prey, she must struggle with her own identity in order to pull off the performance of a lifetime.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nLanguage: Mandarin / Shanghainese/ Cantonese/ Japanese / English / Hindi\r\n\r\nSubs srt: Portuguese / English  \r\n\r\nGenre: Drama / Romance / Thriller\r\n \r\nFormat : AVI \r\nCodec ID : XVID \r\nFile size : 1.95 GB \r\nDuration : 2h 38min \r\nVideo bit rate : 1600 kb/s \r\nWidth : 1280 pixels \r\nHeight : 720 pixels \r\nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9 \r\nFrame rate : 23.976 FPS \r\nCodec ID/Hint : MP3 \r\nAudio bit rate : 128 kb/s","last_updated":"2017-10-20T12:01:03.843Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ef302ec559d04ae97ec5c78d687d18c9396ae15","dn":"Se Jie aka Lust Caution 2007 BRRip Sonata Premiere","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"0ef302ec559d04ae97ec5c78d687d18c9396ae15","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,243,2,236,85,157,4,174,151,236,92,120,214,135,209,140,147,150,174,21]},"name":"Se Jie aka Lust Caution 2007 BRRip Sonata Premiere","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
