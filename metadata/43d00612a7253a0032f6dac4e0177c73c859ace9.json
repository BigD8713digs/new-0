After a death row conviction, media frenzy, and the release of an unauthorized biography, her 30-year-old daughter Edie Beckett is just trying to survive out of the spotlight. She&#x2019;s a recovering alcoholic with a dead-end city job and an unhealthy codependent relationship with her brother. \r\n\r\nEdie also has a disturbing secret: a growing obsession with the families of Lilith&#x2019;s victims. She&#x2019;s desperate to see how they&#x2019;ve managed - or failed - to move on. While her escalating fixation is a problem, she&#x2019;s careful to keep her distance. That is, until she crosses a line and a man is found murdered. \r\n\r\nEdie quickly becomes the prime suspect - and while she can&#x2019;t remember everything that happened the night of the murder, she&#x2019;d surely remember killing someone. With the detective who arrested her mother hot on her trail, Edie goes into hiding. She&#x2019;s must get to the truth of what happened that night before the police - or the real killer - find her. \r\n\r\nUnless, of course, she has more in common with her mother than she&#x2019;s willing to admit.... \r\n\r\nPerfect for fans of Ruth Ware, In Her Bones features Moretti&#x2019;s &#x201C;riveting and insightful&#x201D; (Megan Miranda, New York Times best-selling author) prose and &#x201C;chillingly satisfying&#x201D; (Publishers Weekly) twists, and will leave you questioning the nature of guilt, obsession, and the toxicity of familial ties. \r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-09-11T12:16:40.214Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:43d00612a7253a0032f6dac4e0177c73c859ace9","dn":"In Her Bones by Kate Moretti EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"43d00612a7253a0032f6dac4e0177c73c859ace9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,208,6,18,167,37,58,0,50,246,218,196,224,23,124,115,200,89,172,233]},"name":"In Her Bones by Kate Moretti EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
