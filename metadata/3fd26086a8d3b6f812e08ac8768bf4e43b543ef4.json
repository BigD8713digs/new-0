His children grow up, his wife grows older, and his only hope is finding the people who injected him in the first place - not an easy task when one day for Martin lasts four years. And while Martin James strives to find a cure before everyone he loves is gone, others are uncertain if his journey can be stopped at all.\r\n\r\nW. Lawrence weaves a dystopian future filled with the best and worst of humanity, highlights the blessings and curses of technology, and pushes the limits of faith and hopelessness. Above all, Syncing Forward is a tale of one man&apos;s love for his family and their devotion to saving him from being lost forever.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-08-31T12:06:46.673Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:3fd26086a8d3b6f812e08ac8768bf4e43b543ef4","dn":"Syncing Forward by W Lawrence ePUB eBOOK-ZAK","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"3fd26086a8d3b6f812e08ac8768bf4e43b543ef4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,210,96,134,168,211,182,248,18,224,138,200,118,139,244,228,59,84,62,244]},"name":"Syncing Forward by W Lawrence ePUB eBOOK-ZAK","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
