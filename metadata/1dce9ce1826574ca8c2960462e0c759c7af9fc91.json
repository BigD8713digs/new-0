They sold 17,000 tickets in moments. \r\n\r\nTo that,people who aren&#x2019;t into 90s rock said: &#x201C;Who?&#x201D;\r\n\r\nTemple of the Dog was members of Soundgarden and Pearl Jam who weren&#x2019;t stars when they first started the project and delivered their sole, eponymous debut in 1991. \r\n\r\nThe album was ignored, until Soundgarden and Pearl Jam broke big. More straight-up hard rock than grunge it ended up going platinum. \r\n Most fans never though they&#x2019;d get to see the band, which was a tribute to Andrew Wood, the Mother Love Bone vocalist who died of a heroin overdose at age 24 in 1990. Still,this show was far more than something for Pearl Jam and Soundgarden fans. It turned out to be a great night of music that left those in attendance wondering if Temple of the Dog had made more than just a One Shot in the &#x2019;90s.\r\n\r\nMight we be talking about inducting Temple of the Dog into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame next year, instead of heavy favorites Pearl Jam?\r\nChris Cornell struggled with depression for much of his life. He was found dead early on the morning of May 18, 2017.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll Tracks 320ak mp3\r\n\r\nTracklist Disk 1\r\n\r\n01 Intro  Say Hello 2 Heaven\r\n02 Chat\r\n03 Wooden Jesus\r\n04 Call Me A Dog\r\n05 Chat\r\n06 Your Saviour\r\n07 Chat\r\n08 Stardog Champion \r\n09 Stargazer \r\n10 Chat\r\n11 Seasons \r\n12 Jump Into The Fire \r\n13 Four Walled World\r\n14 I&apos;m A Mover \r\n15 Pushin Forward Back\r\n16 Hunger Strike\r\n17 Chat\r\n18 Hey Baby \r\n\r\nDisk 2\r\n\r\n19 Heartshine \r\n20 River Of Deceit\r\n21 Holy Roller \r\n22 Reach Down\r\n23 Encore Break #1\r\n24 Chat\r\n25 Man Of Golden Words (with Comfortably Numb tease) \r\n26 Baby Lemonade \r\n27 Times Of Trouble\r\n28 Achilles Last Stand\r\n29 Band Intros &amp; Chat\r\n30 Holy Holy \r\n31 Fascination Street \r\n32 War Pigs \r\n33 Encore Break #2\r\n34 All Night Thing\r\n\r\nPlayers\r\nStone Gossard, Jeff Ament, Mike McCready, Matt Cameron, and The Voice\r\nChris Cornell","last_updated":"2018-08-16T12:10:58.426Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:1dce9ce1826574ca8c2960462e0c759c7af9fc91","dn":"Temple Of The Dog - In Memory,San Francisco(2-CD)2018ak","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"1dce9ce1826574ca8c2960462e0c759c7af9fc91","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,206,156,225,130,101,116,202,140,41,96,70,46,12,117,156,122,249,252,145]},"name":"Temple Of The Dog - In Memory,San Francisco(2-CD)2018ak","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
