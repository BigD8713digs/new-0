Nicu is all big eyes and ill-fitting clothes, eager as a puppy, even when they&apos;re picking up litter in the park for community service. He&apos;s so not her type. Appearances matter to Jess. She&apos;s got a lot to hide.\r\n\r\nNicu thinks Jess is beautiful. His dad brought Nicu and his mum here for a better life, but now all they talk about is going back home to find Nicu a wife. The last thing Nicu wants is to get married. He wants to get educated, do better, and stay here in England. But his dad&apos;s fists are the most powerful force in Nicu&apos;s life, and in the end he&apos;ll have to do what his dad wants.\r\n\r\nAs Nicu and Jess get closer, their secrets come to the surface like bruises. The only safe place they have is with each other. But they can&apos;t be together forever and stay safe - can they?\r\n\r\nAn extraordinary, high-impact, high-emotion collaboration between two Carnegie short-listed rising stars of YA.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-07-09T12:00:45.935Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:e4759ed1320416d0cbb1146d175b9f7e641b10c0","dn":"We Come Apart by Sarah Crossan and Brian Conaghan ePUB eBOOK-ZAK","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"e4759ed1320416d0cbb1146d175b9f7e641b10c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,117,158,209,50,4,22,208,203,177,20,109,23,91,159,126,100,27,16,192]},"name":"We Come Apart by Sarah Crossan and Brian Conaghan ePUB eBOOK-ZAK","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
