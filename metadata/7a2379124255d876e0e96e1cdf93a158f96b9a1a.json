As chief speechwriter for President Bush, he was given unprecedented access to some of the most sensitive intelligence our government possessed on al Qaeda terrorists. He has since spent countless hours interviewing the men and women involved in the interrogations at every level&#x2014;from Vice President Dick Cheney to the interrogators themselves. In chilling detail, Thiessen reveals how close the terrorists came to striking again, and how intelligence gained from &#x201C;enhanced interrogation&#x201D; repeatedly stymied their plots. He also shows how President Obama&#x2019;s dismantling of this CIA program, as well as his releasing of secret documents that have aided our enemies, is inviting disaster for America.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-09-02T12:05:02.219Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a2379124255d876e0e96e1cdf93a158f96b9a1a","dn":"Courting Disaster_ How the CIA Kept America Safe and How Barack ","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"7a2379124255d876e0e96e1cdf93a158f96b9a1a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,35,121,18,66,85,216,118,224,233,110,28,223,147,161,88,249,107,154,26]},"name":"Courting Disaster_ How the CIA Kept America Safe and How Barack ","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
