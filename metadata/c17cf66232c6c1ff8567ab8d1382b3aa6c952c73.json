With the help of her best friend, she fled New York City for a small resort town, snagged a job as the advice columnist for the local paper, and is cautiously letting a new man into her life. But when Hugh and his perfect new family move into a house nearby, Nora backslides. Coping with jealousy, humiliation, and resentment again is as hard as she feared. It&apos;s harder still when Hugh and his wife are shot to death in their home.\r\n\r\nIf only Nora could account for the night of the murders. Unfortunately, her memories have gone as dark as her fantasies of revenge. But Nora&apos;s not the only one with a reason to kill - and as prime suspect in the crime, she&apos;d better be able to prove it.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-02-08T12:07:08.319Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:c17cf66232c6c1ff8567ab8d1382b3aa6c952c73","dn":"Tips for Living by Ren&eacute;e Shafransky MOBI","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"c17cf66232c6c1ff8567ab8d1382b3aa6c952c73","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,124,246,98,50,198,193,255,133,103,171,141,19,130,179,170,108,149,44,115]},"name":"Tips for Living by Ren&eacute;e Shafransky MOBI","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
