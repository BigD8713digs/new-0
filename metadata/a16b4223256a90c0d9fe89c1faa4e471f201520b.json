He was assigned to guard Nelson Mandela, who he was told was a dangerous terrorist. Over time, he became friendly with Mandela, even helping his wife Winnie bring in their grandchild for Mandela to hold for the first time.\r\n\r\nThe bond of trust between the two men extended beyond Mandela&apos;s prison years. As President of South Africa, he called for Christo and gave him a job in the archives department in Parliament. A few weeks before his death, Mandela made another call, to say goodbye.\r\n\r\nMandela: My Prisoner, My Friend is the story of Mandela&apos;s life in Christo Brand&apos;s own words, and of a powerful friendship forming in the most unlikely of places.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-09-11T12:00:32.787Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:a16b4223256a90c0d9fe89c1faa4e471f201520b","dn":"Mandela_ My Prisoner, My Friend by Christo Brand MOBI eBOOK-ZAK","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"a16b4223256a90c0d9fe89c1faa4e471f201520b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,107,66,35,37,106,144,192,217,254,137,193,250,164,228,113,242,1,82,11]},"name":"Mandela_ My Prisoner, My Friend by Christo Brand MOBI eBOOK-ZAK","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
