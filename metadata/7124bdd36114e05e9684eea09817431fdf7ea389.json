His chance comes when he&apos;s promised exclusive access to death row inmate Jeffrey Halcomb, the notorious cult leader and mass murderer who&apos;s ready to break his silence after 30 years, and who contacted Lucas personally from his maximum-security cell.\r\n\r\nWith nothing left to lose, Lucas leaves New York to live in and work from the scene of the crime: a split-level farmhouse on a gray-sanded beach in Washington state whose foundation is steeped in the blood of Halcomb&apos;s diviners - runaways who were drawn to his message of family, unity, and unconditional love. There, Lucas sets out to capture the real story of the departed faithful. Except that he&apos;s not alone. For Jeffrey Halcomb promised his devout eternal life... and within these walls, they&apos;re far from dead.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-06-29T12:14:24.132Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:7124bdd36114e05e9684eea09817431fdf7ea389","dn":"Within These Walls by Ania Ahlborn EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"7124bdd36114e05e9684eea09817431fdf7ea389","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,36,189,211,97,20,224,94,150,132,238,160,152,23,67,31,223,126,163,137]},"name":"Within These Walls by Ania Ahlborn EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
