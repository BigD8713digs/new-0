Where are we? Who are we? Are our emotions, our beliefs, and our hopes and dreams ultimately meaningless out there in the void?\r\n\r\nIn short chapters filled with intriguing historical anecdotes, personal asides, and rigorous exposition, listeners learn the difference between how the world works at the quantum level, the cosmic level, and the human level - and then how each connects to the other. Carroll&apos;s presentation of the principles that have guided the scientific revolution - from Darwin and Einstein to the origins of life, consciousness, and the universe - is dazzlingly unique.\r\n\r\nCarroll shows how an avalanche of discoveries in the past few hundred years has changed our world and what really matters to us. Our lives are dwarfed like never before by the immensity of space and time, but they are redeemed by our capacity to comprehend it and give it meaning.\r\n\r\nThe Big Picture is an unprecedented scientific worldview, a tour de force that will be listened to alongside the works of Stephen Hawking, Carl Sagan, Daniel Dennett, and E. O. Wilson for years to come","last_updated":"2018-04-01T12:04:10.823Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6aa15cc0a90c35eba2f917abf174c932e88f63f","dn":"Sean Carroll-The Big Picture","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"e6aa15cc0a90c35eba2f917abf174c932e88f63f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,170,21,204,10,144,195,94,186,47,145,122,191,23,76,147,46,136,246,63]},"name":"Sean Carroll-The Big Picture","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
