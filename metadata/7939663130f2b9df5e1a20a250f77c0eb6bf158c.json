IT DESTROYS US. NOW WE MUST LEARN TO LIVE WITHOUT IT. \r\n\r\nThe Feed is accessible everywhere, by everyone, at any time. It instantaneously links us to all information and global events as they break. Every interaction, every emotion, every image can be shared through it; it is the essential tool everyone relies on to know and understand the thoughts and feelings of partners, parents, friends, children, colleagues, bosses, employees...in fact, of anyone and everyone else in the world. \r\n\r\nTom and Kate use the Feed, but Tom has resisted its addiction, which makes him suspect to his family. After all, his father created it. But that opposition to constant connection serves Tom and Kate well when the Feed collapses after a horrific tragedy shatters the world as they know it. \r\n\r\nThe Feed&apos;s collapse, taking modern society with it, leaves people scavenging to survive. Finding food is truly a matter of life and death. Minor ailments, previously treatable, now kill. And while the collapse has demolished the trappings of the modern world, it has also eroded trust. In a world where survival of the fittest is a way of life, there is no one to depend upon except yourself...and maybe even that is no longer true. \r\n\r\nTom and Kate have managed to protect themselves and their family. But then their six-year-old daughter, Bea, goes missing. Who has taken her? How do you begin to look for someone in a world without technology? And what happens when you can no longer even be certain that the people you love are really who they claim to be? \r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-03-13T12:28:28.790Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:7939663130f2b9df5e1a20a250f77c0eb6bf158c","dn":"The Feed: A Novel by Nick Clark Windo EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"7939663130f2b9df5e1a20a250f77c0eb6bf158c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,57,102,49,48,242,185,223,94,26,32,162,80,247,124,14,182,191,21,140]},"name":"The Feed: A Novel by Nick Clark Windo EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
