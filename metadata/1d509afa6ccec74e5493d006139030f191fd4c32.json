Enormous economic improvements transformed the continent. The catastrophic era of the world wars receded into an ever more distant past, though its long shadow continued to shape mentalities.\r\n\r\nGenre: Non-Fiction &gt; History","last_updated":"2018-09-11T12:17:07.569Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d509afa6ccec74e5493d006139030f191fd4c32","dn":"Roller-Coaster: Europe, 1950-2017 by Ian Kershaw (.epub) ","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"1d509afa6ccec74e5493d006139030f191fd4c32","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,80,154,250,108,206,199,78,84,147,208,6,19,144,48,241,145,253,76,50]},"name":"Roller-Coaster: Europe, 1950-2017 by Ian Kershaw (.epub) ","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
