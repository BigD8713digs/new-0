Only when they forgot this aspect of their identity did these nations begin to decline. Recognizing that the United States and China are modern naval powers&#x2014;rather than seapowers&#x2014;is essential to understanding current affairs, as well as the long-term trends in world history. This volume is a highly original &#x201C;big think&#x201D; analysis of five states whose success&#x2014;and eventual failure&#x2014;is a subject of enduring interest, by a scholar at the top of his game.\r\n\r\nGenre: Non-Fiction &gt; History, Maritime History","last_updated":"2018-12-07T12:22:30.884Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:355358190badb0762bbc66ce0fff4312b80a27aa","dn":"Seapower States by Andrew Lambert (.ePUB)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"355358190badb0762bbc66ce0fff4312b80a27aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,83,88,25,11,173,176,118,43,188,102,206,15,255,67,18,184,10,39,170]},"name":"Seapower States by Andrew Lambert (.ePUB)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
