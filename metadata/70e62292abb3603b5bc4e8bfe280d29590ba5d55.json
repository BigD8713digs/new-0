Newly laid out for ease of use with an increased number of images in color, it updates and improves the first edition to remain the most comprehensive book on the subject. One of the wonders of the universe we live in is the Milky Way, and this book provides a wonderful tour of its highlights for amateur astronomers.\r\nNorthern hemisphere observers interested in viewing our own galaxy&apos;s finest features will find herein detailed descriptions for every constellation that the Milky Way passes through, including stars, double and multiple stars, emission nebulae, planetary nebulae, dark nebulae and supernovae remnants, open and globular clusters, and galaxies. \r\nInglis also describes the one thing that is often left out of observing guides - the amazing star clouds of the Milky Way itself. In addition to the descriptive text there are many star charts and maps, as well as the latest images made by observatories and amateur astronomers around the world and in space. This updated version offers new scientific material and an easy-to-use layout perfect for many nights of fruitful observation.\r\n\r\nAbout the Author\r\nMike Inglis is a professional astronomer who also has a life-long passion for amateur astronomy. In addition to observing the night sky whenever he can he has worked at the University of Hertfordshire and Warwick University in the UK, at Princeton University in the USA, and used some of the world&#x2019;s largest telescopes in Australia, La Palma and Hawaii. He is the author of several astronomy books for amateurs and students, and has had many articles published in both popular astronomy magazines and research level journals. He is series editor for three Springer series: &quot;Undergraduate Lecture Notes in Physics &amp; Astrophysics&quot; for degree-level Physics and Astrophysics students; &quot;SpringerBriefs in Astronomy&quot; for PhD astrophysics students and research astrophysicists, and &quot;Astronomers&apos; Observing Guides&quot; for advanced amateur astronomers. He is currently Professor of Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics at the State University of New York, USA.\r\n <a href=\"\nhttps://s24.postimg.org/uj066st11/Astronomy_of_the_Milky_Way_-_The_Observer_s_Guid.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://s24.postimg.org/uj066st11/Astronomy_of_the_Milky_Way_-_The_Observer_s_Guid.jpg</a>","last_updated":"2017-06-01T12:12:56.849Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:70e62292abb3603b5bc4e8bfe280d29590ba5d55","dn":"Astronomy of the Milky Way (2nd Ed)(gnv64)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"70e62292abb3603b5bc4e8bfe280d29590ba5d55","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,230,34,146,171,179,96,59,91,196,232,191,226,128,210,149,144,186,93,85]},"name":"Astronomy of the Milky Way (2nd Ed)(gnv64)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
