With the SGC under attack, and Vice President Kinsey breathing down their necks, it&#x2019;s up to Colonel Jack O&#x2019;Neill and his team to uncover the saboteur and save the fledgling alliance. But unbeknownst to SG-1 there are far greater forces at work &#x2014; a calculating revenge that spans decades, and a desperate gambit to prevent a cataclysm of epic proportions. \r\n\r\nWhen the identity of the saboteur is revealed, O&#x2019;Neill is faced with a horrifying truth and is forced into an unlikely alliance in order to fight for Earth&#x2019;s future&#x2026; \r\n\r\nRelativity \r\nBack in the tunnel-like corridor, Jack and Daniel made their way down the passageway. The alert sirens were sounding as the detachments made their way through the open wormhole to the Pack&#x2019;s rendezvous point. \r\n\r\n&#x201C;You think Teal&#x2019;c might be right?&#x201D; O&#x2019;Neill asked the question without looking at the younger man. \r\n\r\n&#x201C;What, are we going to break out the thumbscrews, Jack?&#x201D; The scientist pinched the bridge of his nose. &#x201C;Come on, I mean &#x2018;forceful application&#x2019;? He was talking about torture.&#x2019; \r\n\r\nO&#x2019;Neill shot him a look. &#x201C;Teal&#x2019;c&#x2019;s been on the wrong end of a Goa&#x2019;uld pain-stick enough times to know what it&#x2019;s like, Daniel. And I had my fair share too. It&#x2019;s not something he&#x2019;d say lightly.&#x201D; \r\n\r\n&#x201C;I can&#x2019;t believe we&#x2019;re even having this conversation.&#x201D; Jackson shook his head. \r\n\r\n&#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t say we were gonna stretch her on a rack, damn it!&#x201D; The colonel&#x2019;s temper flared briefly. &#x201C;But we might have to ask some hard questions. I&#x2019;m thinking we could call in the Tok&#x2019;ra, maybe use that mind-scanner gizmo they got.&#x201D; \r\n\r\n&#x201C;You say that like it&#x2019;s the gentler option.&#x201D; \r\n\r\nJack stopped and looked the other man in the eye. &#x201C;Hey!&#x201D; He snapped his fingers in front of Daniel&#x2019;s face. &#x201C;Hey, Space Monkey! Look at me! What&#x2019;s goin&#x2019; on? This woman lied her ass off to you, she tried to blow us all up, and here you are stepping up to defend her? Am I missing something?&#x201D;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOfficial AnonCrypt accounts:  <a href=\"\nhttps://1337x.to/user/AnonCrypt/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://1337x.to/user/AnonCrypt/</a>  <a href=\"\nhttps://thepiratebay.org/user/AnonCrypt/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://thepiratebay.org/user/AnonCrypt/</a> <a href=\"\nhttps://katcr.co/user/AnonCrypt/profile/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://katcr.co/user/AnonCrypt/profile/</a>  <a href=\"\nhttps://www.torrentfunk.com/user/anoncrypt.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://www.torrentfunk.com/user/anoncrypt.html</a> \r\r\n\r\n- Please see our newest torrents for an updated list","last_updated":"2018-07-03T12:05:11.731Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c08516c8cb603fe7ef0db457c8fb9dbbe291b64","dn":"Stargate SG-1 - Relativity - SG1-10 - Fandemonium","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"5c08516c8cb603fe7ef0db457c8fb9dbbe291b64","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,8,81,108,140,182,3,254,126,240,219,69,124,143,185,219,190,41,27,100]},"name":"Stargate SG-1 - Relativity - SG1-10 - Fandemonium","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
