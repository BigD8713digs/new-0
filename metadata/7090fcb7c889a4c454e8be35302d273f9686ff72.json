In The Path to Wealth: Seven Spiritual Steps for Financial Abundance, multimillionaire entrepreneur and angel investor May McCarthy shares her own daily practice to help you do just that.\r\n\r\nThe first step on this journey is to welcome a new member to your financial advisory team: the all-knowing power of the universe that McCarthy affectionately calls the Chief Spiritual Officer, or CSO for short.\r\n\r\nIn part one of the book, you&apos;ll learn how to set up and activate the seven-step daily practice. You&apos;ll learn the job descriptions for both yourself and your new partner, and you&apos;ll see that when these steps are applied on a daily basis, you will experience a complete shift in your thinking about how financial wealth and abundance are created.\r\n\r\nIn part two, you&apos;ll go deeper into the practice to gain insight about your purpose, learn how to successfully navigate financial ups and downs, and overcome the fear of failure as well as eliminate old beliefs and behaviors that have kept you from experiencing the success you really want.\r\n\r\nBest of all, the steps outlined in this book will teach you how to develop your own financial intuition, which is key to noticing and pursuing the opportunities that will present themselves once you are on this path.\r\n\r\nFinancial abundance can be a game of fun and prosperity, but only when you realize that you don&apos;t have to do everything yourself. Your new partner wants to help you. Let May McCarthy show you the way.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-05-31T12:00:49.352Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:7090fcb7c889a4c454e8be35302d273f9686ff72","dn":"The Path to Wealth by May McCarthy EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"7090fcb7c889a4c454e8be35302d273f9686ff72","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,144,252,183,200,137,164,196,84,232,190,53,48,45,39,63,150,134,255,114]},"name":"The Path to Wealth by May McCarthy EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
