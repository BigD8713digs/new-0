When does the shell of an egg harden? Why do some eggs contain two yolks? How are the colours and patterns of eggshells created, and why do they vary? And which end of an egg is laid first - the blunt end or the pointy end?\r\n\r\nThese are just some of the questions The Most Perfect Thing answers, as the journey of a bird&apos;s egg from creation and fertilisation to its eventual hatching is examined, with current scientific knowledge placed within an historical context.\r\n\r\nBeginning with an examination of the stunning eggs of the guillemot, each of which is so variable in pattern and colour that no two are ever the same, acclaimed ornithologist Tim Birkhead then looks at the eggs of hens, cuckoos and many other birds, revealing weird and wonderful facts about these miracles of nature. Woven around and supporting these facts are extraordinary stories of the individuals who, from as far back as ancient Egypt, have been fixated on the study and collection of eggs, not always to the benefit of their conservation.\r\n\r\nFirmly grounded in science and enriched by a wealth of observation drawn from a lifetime spent studying birds, The Most Perfect Thing is an illuminating and engaging exploration of the science behind eggs and the history of man&apos;s obsession with them.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-11-05T12:01:39.967Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:90670911b2a22a88d624c6804d655b3ebb625006","dn":"The Most Perfect Thing by Tim Birkhead EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"90670911b2a22a88d624c6804d655b3ebb625006","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,103,9,17,178,162,42,136,214,36,198,128,77,101,91,62,187,98,80,6]},"name":"The Most Perfect Thing by Tim Birkhead EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
