Sent to interview trapeze artist Ebony Diamond, Frankie finds herself fascinated by the tightly laced acrobat and follows her across London to a Mayfair corset shop that hides more than one dark secret.\r\n\r\nThen Ebony Diamond mysteriously disappears in the middle of a performance, and Frankie is drawn into a world of tricks, society columnists, corset fetishists, suffragettes, and circus freaks. How did Ebony vanish, who was she afraid of, and what goes on behind the doors of the mysterious Hourglass Factory?\r\n\r\nFrom the newsrooms of Fleet Street to the drawing rooms of high society, the missing Ebony Diamond leads Frankie to the trail of a murderous villain with a plot more deadly than anyone could have imagined....\r\n\r\nWith a major film, Suffragette, starring Meryl Streep, Helena Bonham-Carter, and Carey Mulligan, coming soon, suffragettes will be back in the limelight once again, nearly 100 years after they fought for votes for women.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-07-15T12:01:04.856Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:08b8a963c80c3eb40bd71e3ac0de29d977f40489","dn":"The Hourglass Factory by Lucy Ribchester EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"08b8a963c80c3eb40bd71e3ac0de29d977f40489","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,184,169,99,200,12,62,180,11,215,30,58,192,222,41,217,119,244,4,137]},"name":"The Hourglass Factory by Lucy Ribchester EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
