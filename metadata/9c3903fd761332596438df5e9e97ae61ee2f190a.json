When he suffered an injury and then a stroke during his third tour, he wound up back home in Iowa, no longer able to be either a doctor or a soldier.\r\n\r\nIn this gorgeous memoir that moves from his impoverished upbringing on an Oneida reservation, to his harrowing stints as a volunteer medic in Kosovo and Bosnia, through the madness of Iraq and his intense mandate to assemble a team to identify the remains of Uday and Qusay Hussein, and the struggle afterward to come to terms with a life irrevocably changed, Kerstetter beautifully illuminates war and survival, the fragility of the human body, and the strength of will that lies within.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-09-07T12:01:58.052Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c3903fd761332596438df5e9e97ae61ee2f190a","dn":"Crossings_ A Doctor-Soldier's Story by Jon Kerstetter ePUB eBOOK","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"9c3903fd761332596438df5e9e97ae61ee2f190a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,57,3,253,118,19,50,89,100,56,223,94,158,151,174,97,238,47,25,10]},"name":"Crossings_ A Doctor-Soldier's Story by Jon Kerstetter ePUB eBOOK","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
