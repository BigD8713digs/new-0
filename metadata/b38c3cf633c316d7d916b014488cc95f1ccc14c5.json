When things get really bad, there&#x2019;s no other choice but to configure a new system setup. And this is where O&amp;O BlueCon comes in. O&amp;O BlueCon is at an administrator&#x2019;s side during the course of a daily routine as well as whenever disaster strikes. Based on Windows PE, it offers a wide range of programs for, among other things, repairing systems, searching and correcting errors, restoring lost data, resetting passwords, and the list goes on. O&amp;O BlueCon is an administrator&#x2019;s IT first aid kit for day to day use. \r\n\r\nO&amp;O BlueCon starts all programs directly from a bootable medium (CD/DVD or USB stick) and can so avoid the risk of data loss caused by overwriting data on the computer, which might be the case with a new installation. Seamless integration of all O&amp;O BlueCon components saves the user the time-consuming job of collecting individual programs. \r\n\r\nO&amp;O BlueCon 15 New Features: \r\n- Restoring accidentally deleted data \r\n- Backing up and restoring data \r\n- Driver problems and service issues \r\n- Secure deletion of data volumes \r\n- Resetting passwords \r\n- Partitioning hard disks \r\n- Combat errors in the registry database \r\n- Advanced error detection &#x2013; EventViewer and CheckDisk \r\n- Locating and removing data \r\n- Downloading additional tools: Integrated web browser \r\n- NEW: Creation of a PXE Boot Medium direct from the Boot Assistant \r\n- NEW: Bitlocker drives can be unlocked and accessed \r\n- NEW: Scripting over Windows 10 networks \r\n- Support too for Hyper-V \r\n- Supports Windows&#xAE; 7 to Windows Server 2016&#xAE;","last_updated":"2017-12-30T12:07:29.346Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:b38c3cf633c316d7d916b014488cc95f1ccc14c5","dn":"O&amp;O BlueCon Admin Edition 15.0 Build 4073 Bootable ISO","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"b38c3cf633c316d7d916b014488cc95f1ccc14c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,140,60,246,51,195,22,215,217,22,176,20,72,140,201,95,28,204,20,197]},"name":"O&amp;O BlueCon Admin Edition 15.0 Build 4073 Bootable ISO","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
