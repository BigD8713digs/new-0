But her discovery sets a fantastical underworld stirring, and a horde of daemons, witches, and vampires soon descends upon the library. \r\n\r\nDiana has stumbled upon a coveted treasure lost for centuries, and she is the only creature who can break its spell.\r\n\r\n   Shadow of Night:\r\nDiana and Matthew are plunged into Elizabethan London, a world of spies, subterfuge, and a coterie of Matthew&#x2019;s old friends, the mysterious School of Night that includes Christopher Marlowe and Walter Raleigh. \r\n\r\nHere, Diana must locate a witch to tutor her in magic, Matthew is forced to confront a past he thought he had put to rest, and the mystery of Ashmole 782 deepens.\r\n\r\n   The Book of Life:\r\nAfter traveling through time in Shadow of Night, Diana Bishop and vampire scientist Matthew Clairmont return to the present to face new crises and old enemies. At Matthew&#x2019;s ancestral home at Sept-Tours, they reunite with the cast of characters from A Discovery of Witches, with one significant exception. \r\n\r\nBut the real threat to their future has yet to be revealed, and when it is, the search for Ashmole 782 and its missing pages takes on even more urgency.From the hills of the Auvergne to the palaces of Venice and beyond, the couple at last learn what the witches discovered so many centuries ago.\r\n\r\n\r\nNarrated By: Jennifer Ikeda\r\nFormat: Stereo mp3\r\nBit Rate: 64Kbps/44.1Hz","last_updated":"2018-09-19T12:09:50.420Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea9fe5c83f7a5fd30b64e54fd186f536ea568806","dn":"Times Convert [The All Souls Trilogy] - Deborah Harkness","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"ea9fe5c83f7a5fd30b64e54fd186f536ea568806","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,159,229,200,63,122,95,211,11,100,229,79,209,134,245,54,234,86,136,6]},"name":"Times Convert [The All Souls Trilogy] - Deborah Harkness","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
