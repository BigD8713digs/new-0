She collects words, stores them up as a way of fending off the hard truths of her life, the truths that she can&apos;t write down in stories.\r\n\r\nThe fresh pain of her mother&apos;s death. The burden of raising her sisters while her father struggles over his brokeback farm. The mad welter of feelings Mattie has for handsome but dull Royal Loomis, who says he wants to marry her. And the secret dreams that keep her going: visions of finishing high school, going to college in New York City, becoming a writer.\r\n\r\nYet when the drowned body of a young woman turns up at the hotel where Mattie works, all her words are useless. But in the dead woman&apos;s letters, Mattie again finds her voice, and a determination to live her own life.\r\n\r\nSet in 1906 against the backdrop of the murder that inspired Theodore Dreiser&apos;s An American Tragedy, this coming-of-age novel effortlessly weaves romance, history and a murder mystery into something moving, and real, and wholly original.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-09-17T12:22:09.791Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:27675842491e70c25e3f7a5c60d457440938b983","dn":"A Northern Light by Jennifer Donnelly EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"27675842491e70c25e3f7a5c60d457440938b983","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,103,88,66,73,30,112,194,94,63,122,92,96,212,87,68,9,56,185,131]},"name":"A Northern Light by Jennifer Donnelly EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
