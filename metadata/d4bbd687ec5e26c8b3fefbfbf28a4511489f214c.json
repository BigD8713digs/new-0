Confined to her house during the day, her company is limited to her widowed father and her best (okay, only) friend. It isn&apos;t until after nightfall that Katie&apos;s world opens up, when she takes her guitar to the local train station and plays for the people coming and going.\r\n\r\nCharlie Reed is a former all-star athlete at a crossroads in his life - and the boy Katie has secretly admired from afar for years. When he happens upon her playing guitar one night, fate intervenes and the two embark on a star-crossed romance.\r\n\r\nAs they challenge each other to chase their dreams and fall for each other under the summer night sky, Katie and Charlie form a bond strong enough to change them - and everyone around them - forever.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-09-29T12:07:59.197Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:d4bbd687ec5e26c8b3fefbfbf28a4511489f214c","dn":"Midnight Sun by Trish Cook EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"d4bbd687ec5e26c8b3fefbfbf28a4511489f214c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,187,214,135,236,94,38,200,179,254,251,251,242,138,69,17,72,159,33,76]},"name":"Midnight Sun by Trish Cook EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
