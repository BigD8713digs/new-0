The box office was booming, and the studios&#x2019; control of talent and distribution was as airtight as could be hoped. But the industry&#x2019;s relationship with Washington was decidedly uneasy - hearings and investigations into allegations of corruption and racketeering were multiplying, and hanging in the air was the insinuation that the business was too foreign, too Jewish, too &quot;un-American&quot; in its values and causes. Could an industry this powerful in shaping America&#x2019;s mind-set really be left in the hands of this crew? Following Pearl Harbor, Hollywood had the chance to prove its critics wrong and did so with vigor, turning its talents and its business over to the war effort to an unprecedented extent.\r\n\r\nNo industry professionals played a bigger role in the war than America&#x2019;s most legendary directors: Ford, Wyler, Huston, Capra, and Stevens. Between them they were on the scene of almost every major moment of America&#x2019;s war, and in every branch of service - army, navy, and air force; Atlantic and Pacific; from Midway to North Africa; from Normandy to the fall of Paris and the liberation of the Nazi death camps; to the shaping of the message out of Washington, D.C.\r\n\r\nAs it did for so many others, World War II divided the lives of these men into before and after, to an extent that has not been adequately understood. In a larger sense - even less well understood - the war divided the history of Hollywood into before and after as well. Harris reckons with that transformation on a human level - through five unforgettable lives - and on the level of the industry and the country as a whole. Like these five men, Hollywood too, and indeed all of America, came back from the war having grown up more than a little.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-08-10T12:01:51.989Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:176e76965997dcc23194f9f50152e45e8c543980","dn":"Five Came Back_ A Story of Hollywood and the Second World War by","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"176e76965997dcc23194f9f50152e45e8c543980","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,110,118,150,89,151,220,194,49,148,249,245,1,82,228,94,140,84,57,128]},"name":"Five Came Back_ A Story of Hollywood and the Second World War by","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
