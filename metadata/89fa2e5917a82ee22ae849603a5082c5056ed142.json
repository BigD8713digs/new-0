The unconscious woman clinging to life after a hit and run is FBI agent Macy Crow. What the woman from Quantico was doing in a dark alley after midnight is just one mystery. The other is more unsettling: Macy is Faith&#x2019;s mirror image&#x2014;the twin sister she never knew she had.\r\n\r\nFaith knew that she was adopted, but now she&#x2019;s finding that her childhood concealed other secrets. Following the trail of clues Macy left behind, Faith and Texas Ranger Mitchell Hayden make a shocking discovery on an isolated country ranch&#x2014;a burial ground for three women who disappeared thirty years before.\r\n\r\nThey weren&#x2019;t the only victims in a killer&#x2019;s twisted plot. And they won&#x2019;t be the last.\r\n\r\nAs the missing pieces of Faith&#x2019;s and Macy&#x2019;s dark lives snap into place, Faith is becoming more terrified by what she sees&#x2014;and by what she must do to save her sister and herself from the past.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-10-14T12:05:32.578Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:89fa2e5917a82ee22ae849603a5082c5056ed142","dn":"Cut and Run by Mary Burton EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"89fa2e5917a82ee22ae849603a5082c5056ed142","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,250,46,89,23,168,46,226,42,232,73,96,58,80,130,197,5,110,209,66]},"name":"Cut and Run by Mary Burton EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
