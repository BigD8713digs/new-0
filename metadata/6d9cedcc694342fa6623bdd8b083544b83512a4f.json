This was the last gasp of the Gilded Age, of Kings and Kaisers and Czars, of pointed or plumed hats, colored uniforms, and all the pomp and romance that went along with war. How quickly it all changed...and how horrible it became.\r\n\r\nTuchman masterfully portrays this transition from 19th to 20th Century, focusing on the turning point in the year 1914: the month leading up to the war and the first month of the war. With fine attention to detail, she reveals how and why the war started, and why it could have been stopped but wasn&apos;t, managing to make the story utterly suspenseful even when we already know the outcome.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-09-23T12:01:03.131Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d9cedcc694342fa6623bdd8b083544b83512a4f","dn":"The Guns of August_ The Outbreak of WWI by Barbara W Tuchman ePU","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"6d9cedcc694342fa6623bdd8b083544b83512a4f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,156,237,204,105,67,66,250,102,35,189,216,176,131,84,75,131,81,42,79]},"name":"The Guns of August_ The Outbreak of WWI by Barbara W Tuchman ePU","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
