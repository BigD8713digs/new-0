One day, the two boys meet an old gypsy who tells them to use a magic cream and teaches them a spell to turn themselves into bears. When they find their sister&apos;s strange freckle cream, they do become bears. Unfortunately, when they turn back into boys, no one will believe their story.\r\n    &#x2014;Daniel Bubbeo \r\n-------    \r\n\r\nCast (in credits order) complete, awaiting verification  \r\n\r\nEddie Albert \t...

There&apos;s animal transformation, two brothers becoming bears instead of Canines, a witches&apos; spell, this time on face cream as the catalyst rather than a cursed ring, a parent hitting the books to read about Lycanthropy and psychiatrists assuming dad&apos;s a nut job for believing his sons are bears. It also has singing teen Brenda Lee, as Shaggy Dog had Annette Funicello in a similar role.\r\n\r\n\r\n           Landseer","last_updated":"2017-11-12T12:02:11.133Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:14b61be1eac7cea91093869d3ded1a66536acaf7","dn":"The Two Little Bears (1961) ","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"14b61be1eac7cea91093869d3ded1a66536acaf7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,182,27,225,234,199,206,169,16,147,134,157,61,237,26,102,83,106,202,247]},"name":"The Two Little Bears (1961) ","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
