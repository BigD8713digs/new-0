The judge&#x2019;s cook watches over her distractedly, for his thoughts are often on his son, Biju, who is hopscotching from one gritty New York restaurant to another. Kiran Desai&#x2019;s brilliant novel, published to huge acclaim, is a story of joy and despair. Her characters face numerous choices that majestically illuminate the consequences of colonialism as it collides with the modern world","last_updated":"2018-11-28T12:04:35.924Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:fbff898b151bf386744efbb22fe3d6d08889e03a","dn":"The Inheritance of Loss","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"fbff898b151bf386744efbb22fe3d6d08889e03a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,255,137,139,21,27,243,134,116,78,251,178,47,227,214,208,136,137,224,58]},"name":"The Inheritance of Loss","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
