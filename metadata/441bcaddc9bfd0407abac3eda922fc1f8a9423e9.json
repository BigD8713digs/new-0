But things fell apart when, in 2008, he was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. His illness brought about the end of his calling and he found himself in need of a new project and purpose. And so it came to be that in 2011 Chris began a campaign called Walk a Mile In my Shoes. He walks around the edge of the UK &#x2013; the edge of society being where many people with mental health problems feel they are &#x2013; without spending any money and relying on the kindness of strangers. In 2015 he joined forces with See Me Scotland to distil the success of the coastal walk into a series of events, inviting other people to join him and discuss mental health. He encouraged them to literally walk a mile in each other&apos;s shoes. Walk a Mile: Tales of a Wandering Loon is the story of how a normal, nurturing childhood turned into one of neglect and abuse and how this, combined with a little faulty brain wiring, lead to a severe and enduring mental illness. It is also the story of one man&apos;s journey towards tackling mental health stigma, one step at a time","last_updated":"2018-01-30T12:03:48.848Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:441bcaddc9bfd0407abac3eda922fc1f8a9423e9","dn":"Walk a Mile - Tales of a Wandering Loon by Chris Young","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"441bcaddc9bfd0407abac3eda922fc1f8a9423e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,27,202,221,201,191,208,64,122,186,195,237,169,34,252,31,138,148,35,233]},"name":"Walk a Mile - Tales of a Wandering Loon by Chris Young","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
