Assumed to have been lost, the manuscript was discovered in late 2014.\r\n\r\nGo Set a Watchman features many of the characters from To Kill a Mockingbird some 20 years later. Returning home to Maycomb to visit her father, Jean Louise Finch - Scout - struggles with issues both personal and political, involving Atticus, society, and the small Alabama town that shaped her.\r\n\r\nExploring how the characters from To Kill a Mockingbird are adjusting to the turbulent events transforming mid-1950s America, Go Set a Watchman casts a fascinating new light on Harper Lee&apos;s enduring classic. Moving, funny, and compelling, it stands as a magnificent novel in its own right","last_updated":"2017-06-22T12:01:02.601Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:4259b40c136b5ea59e360662e9350a6597c34b5f","dn":"Harper Lee - Go Set a Watchman RETAiL ePUB eBOOK-ZAK","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"4259b40c136b5ea59e360662e9350a6597c34b5f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,89,180,12,19,107,94,165,158,54,6,98,233,53,10,101,151,195,75,95]},"name":"Harper Lee - Go Set a Watchman RETAiL ePUB eBOOK-ZAK","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
