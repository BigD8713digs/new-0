Bright, melodic, and transportive, Filous&apos; breezy musical style was honed with sun-bathed remixes of tracks from artists like Kodaline, Jos&#xE9; Gonz&#xE1;lez, Selena Gomez, Milky Chance, Troye Sivan, Tove Lo, and Alex Ebert of Edward Sharpe &amp; the Magnetic Zeros. A self-taught multi-instrumentalist -- counting mandolin, guitar, piano, accordion, flute, bass, and drums as a few of his many skills -- Filous began uploading his remix tracks online in 2014, starting with Damien Jurado&apos;s &quot;Ohio.&quot; The following year he released his first original tune, &quot;How Hard I Try,&quot; featuring James Hersey on vocals. Just as Filous graduated from high school, that track went on to notch over ten million streams and was included on his debut EP, Dawn. Released in the summer of 2015, Dawn included contributions from R.O.B.B., Josh Roa, Bish&#xF8;p, and Jordan Leser, who sang on &quot;Shaded In,&quot; which got its own remix single. The EP went on to peak in the Top 25 of both the Dance and Heatseekers charts. He capped his big year on tour with RAC and Big Data. In 2016, Filous released a cover of the Gorillaz/De La Soul hit &quot;Feel Good Inc.&quot; featuring vocalist LissA. ~ Neil Z.
