As a whole, Boys and Girls fully established the clean, cool vision of Ferry on his own to the general public. \r\nInstead of ragged rock explosions, emotional extremes, and all that made his &apos;70s work so compelling in and out of Roxy, Ferry here is the suave, debonair if secretly moody and melancholic lover, with music to match. Co-producer Rhett Davies, continuing his role from the latter Roxy albums, picks up where Avalon left off right from the slinky opening grooves of &quot;Sensation.&quot; \r\nThe range of people on the album is an intriguing mix, from latterday Roxy members like Andy Newmark and Alan Spenner to avid Roxy disciples like Chic&apos;s Nile Rodgers. Everyone is subordinated to Ferry&apos;s overall vision, and as a result there&apos;s not as much full variety on Boys and Girls as might be thought or hoped. The album&apos;s biggest flaw is indeed that it&apos;s almost too smooth, with not even the hint of threat or edge that Ferry once readily made his own. \r\nAs something that&apos;s a high cut above the usual mid-&apos;80s yuppie smarm music, though, Boys and Girls remains an enjoyable keeper that has aged well.
