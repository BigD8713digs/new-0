Now, with Augustus, he delivers his second spellbinding account of a Roman icon whose legacy has echoed through the ages.\r\n\r\nCaesar Augustus has been called history&apos;s greatest emperor. It was said he found Rome made of clay and left it made of marble. With a senator for a father and Julius Caesar for a great-uncle, he ascended the ranks of Roman society with breathtaking speed. His courage in battle is still questioned, yet his political savvy was second to none. He had a lifelong rival in Mark Antony and a 51-year companion in his wife, Livia. And his influence extended perhaps further than that of any ruler who has ever lived.\r\n\r\nDrawing on the available information, while making a handful of his own groundbreaking assertions, Everitt brings the real Augustus to vivid life in this fascinating narrative.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-08-12T12:00:21.921Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:284cc82260a42442053d94195548edf8870c27f3","dn":"Augustus_ The Life of Rome's First Emperor by Anthony Everitt eP","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"284cc82260a42442053d94195548edf8870c27f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,76,200,34,96,164,36,66,5,61,148,25,85,72,237,248,135,12,39,243]},"name":"Augustus_ The Life of Rome's First Emperor by Anthony Everitt eP","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
