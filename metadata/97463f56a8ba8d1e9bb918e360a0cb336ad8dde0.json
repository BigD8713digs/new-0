It is here that Kelly finds a home among friendly alcoholics and the city&apos;s forgotten residents. But she can&apos;t help but wonder if she is destined to become a part of the dysfunction that surrounds her.\r\n\r\nAs an adult, Kelly is drawn to the thornier truths of her own family history. To piece together the sad narrative of her mother&apos;s life and death, Kelly goes back to the beginning - to a mother she never knew, a 30-year-old cold case, and two of Los Angeles&apos; most notorious murderers.\r\n\r\nUnflinchingly raw and vividly drawn, We Are All Shipwrecks is a memoir of an unconventional childhood and one woman&apos;s courageous journey to the knowledge that where you come from isn&apos;t always who you are.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-09-07T12:01:57.134Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:97463f56a8ba8d1e9bb918e360a0cb336ad8dde0","dn":"We Are All Shipwrecks_ A Memoir by Kelly Carlisle ePUB eBOOK-ZAK","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"97463f56a8ba8d1e9bb918e360a0cb336ad8dde0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,70,63,86,168,186,141,30,155,185,24,227,96,160,203,51,106,216,221,224]},"name":"We Are All Shipwrecks_ A Memoir by Kelly Carlisle ePUB eBOOK-ZAK","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
