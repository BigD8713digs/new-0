At least their large, loving, chaotic family knows what to expect.\r\n\r\nBut Claude is not like his brothers. One day he puts on a dress and refuses to take it off. He wants to bring a purse to kindergarten. He wants hair long enough to sit on. When he grows up, Claude says, he wants to be a girl.\r\n\r\nRosie and Penn aren&apos;t panicked at first. Kids go through phases, after all, and make-believe is fun. But soon the entire family is keeping Claude&apos;s secret. Until one day it explodes.\r\n\r\nLaurie Frankel&apos;s This Is How It Always Is is a book about revelations, transformations, fairy tales, and family. And it&apos;s about the ways this is how it always is: Change is always hard and miraculous and hard again; parenting is always a leap into the unknown with crossed fingers and full hearts; children grow but not always according to plan. And families with secrets don&apos;t get to keep them forever.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-10-09T12:00:59.865Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:5aa33225b6f7414e755bd4f9de8aaa377c8616c5","dn":"This Is How It Always Is by Laurie Frankel EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"5aa33225b6f7414e755bd4f9de8aaa377c8616c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,163,50,37,182,247,65,78,117,91,212,249,222,138,170,55,124,134,22,197]},"name":"This Is How It Always Is by Laurie Frankel EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
