That&#x2019;s the promise of lucid dreaming, which is the ability to alter your own dream reality any way you like simply by being aware of the fact that you&#x2019;re dreaming while you&#x2019;re in the midst of a dream. There is a range of techniques anyone can learn to become a lucid dreamer - and this book provides all the instruction you need to get started. But B. Alan Wallace also shows how to take the experience of lucid dreaming beyond entertainment to use it to heighten creativity, to solve problems, and to increase self-knowledge. He then goes a step further: moving on to the methods of Tibetan Buddhist dream yoga for using your lucid dreams to attain the profoundest kind of insight.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-09-06T12:01:00.701Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:35669933eef3dd9a1c1a147eaa5eb1d9bc784c2a","dn":"Dreaming Yourself Awake_ Lucid Dreaming and Tibetan Dream Yoga f","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"35669933eef3dd9a1c1a147eaa5eb1d9bc784c2a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,102,153,51,238,243,221,154,28,26,20,126,170,94,177,217,188,120,76,42]},"name":"Dreaming Yourself Awake_ Lucid Dreaming and Tibetan Dream Yoga f","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
