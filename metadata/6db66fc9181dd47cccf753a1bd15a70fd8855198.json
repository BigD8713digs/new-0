Whiskey has profoundly influenced America&apos;s political, economic, and cultural destiny, just as those same factors have inspired the evolution and unique flavor of the whiskey itself.\r\n\r\nTaking readers behind the curtain of an enchanting - and sometimes exasperating - industry, the work of writer Reid Mitenbuler crackles with attitude and commentary about taste, choice, and history. Few products better embody the United States, or American business, than bourbon.\r\n\r\nA tale of innovation, success, downfall, and resurrection, Bourbon Empire is an exploration of the spirit in all its unique forms, creating an indelible portrait of both bourbon and the people who make it.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-07-31T12:01:25.656Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:6db66fc9181dd47cccf753a1bd15a70fd8855198","dn":"Bourbon Empire_ The Past and Future of America's Whiskey by Reid","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"6db66fc9181dd47cccf753a1bd15a70fd8855198","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,182,111,201,24,29,212,124,204,247,83,161,189,21,167,15,216,133,81,152]},"name":"Bourbon Empire_ The Past and Future of America's Whiskey by Reid","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
