However, Artificial Intelligence closes the gap by moving past human limitations in order to analyze data.\r\n\r\nWith the help of Artificial Intelligence for big data, you will learn to use Machine Learning algorithms such as k-means, SVM, RBF, and regression to perform advanced data analysis. You will understand the current status of Machine and Deep Learning techniques to work on Genetic and Neuro-Fuzzy algorithms. In addition, you will explore how to develop Artificial Intelligence algorithms to learn from data, why they are necessary, and how they can help solve real-world problems","last_updated":"2018-08-16T12:03:18.433Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:23ef8a8e2445302ed6918eb63d5629c29f84780d","dn":"Artificial Intelligence for Big Data","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"23ef8a8e2445302ed6918eb63d5629c29f84780d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,239,138,142,36,69,48,46,214,145,142,182,61,86,41,194,159,132,120,13]},"name":"Artificial Intelligence for Big Data","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
