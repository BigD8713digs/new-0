While her work has earned her comparisons to Karen Russell and Kelly Link, she has a voice that is all her own. In this electric and provocative debut, Machado bends genre to shape startling narratives that map the realities of women&apos;s lives and the violence visited upon their bodies.\r\n\r\nA wife refuses her husband&apos;s entreaties to remove the green ribbon from around her neck. A woman recounts her sexual encounters as a plague slowly consumes humanity. A salesclerk in a mall makes a horrifying discovery within the seams of the store&apos;s prom dresses. One woman&apos;s surgery-induced weight loss results in an unwanted houseguest. And in the bravura novella Especially Heinous, Machado reimagines every episode of Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit, a show we na&#xEF;vely assumed had shown it all, generating a phantasmagoric police procedural full of doppelg&#xE4;ngers, ghosts, and girls with bells for eyes.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-10-06T12:00:54.755Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:04a7f65532de6139b2e7bf511c4d6b4f8be9cf63","dn":"Her Body and Other Parties_ Stories by Carmen Maria Machado ePUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"04a7f65532de6139b2e7bf511c4d6b4f8be9cf63","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,167,246,85,50,222,97,57,178,231,191,81,28,77,107,79,139,233,207,99]},"name":"Her Body and Other Parties_ Stories by Carmen Maria Machado ePUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
