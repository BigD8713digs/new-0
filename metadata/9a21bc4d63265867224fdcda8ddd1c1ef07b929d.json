But as a pastor (and husband of best-selling author Jen Hatmaker), he&apos;s more interested in rehabbing faith. And in A Mile Wide, he helps readers transform an anemic spiritual life based on a limited understanding of God into a faith of true depth, intimacy, and power.\r\n\r\nOffering fresh perspective on eight essentials of Christianity - the Gospel, identity, Scripture, discipleship, kingdom, mission, community, and justice - Hatmaker provides practical applications that tap in to the richer life Christ promised his people, individually and as a community. God wants more than simply to save us: He&apos;s also determined to transform us, restore us, and use us to reveal the coming of his kingdom right here, right now.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-11-25T13:00:16.020Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a21bc4d63265867224fdcda8ddd1c1ef07b929d","dn":"A Mile Wide by Brandon Hatmaker PDF","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"9a21bc4d63265867224fdcda8ddd1c1ef07b929d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,33,188,77,99,38,88,103,34,79,220,218,141,221,28,30,240,123,146,157]},"name":"A Mile Wide by Brandon Hatmaker PDF","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
