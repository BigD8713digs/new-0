Perfectly positioned to bridge the gap between people of color and white Americans struggling with race complexities, Oluo answers the questions readers don&apos;t dare ask, and explains the concepts that continue to elude everyday Americans.\r\n\r\nOluo is an exceptional writer with a rare ability to be straightforward, funny, and effective in her coverage of sensitive, hyper-charged issues in America. Her messages are passionate but finely tuned, and crystallize ideas that would otherwise be vague by empowering them with aha-moment clarity. Her writing brings to mind voices like Ta-Nehisi Coates and Roxane Gay, and Jessica Valenti in Full Frontal Feminism, and a young Gloria Naylor, particularly in Naylor&apos;s seminal essay &quot;The Meaning of a Word.&quot; A Harper&apos;s Bazaar pick of One of 10 Books to Read in 2018.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-02-07T12:01:58.250Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:09a78e2728019eacb554f66f1f5f226ba732b1e6","dn":"So You Want to Talk About Race by Ijeoma Oluo EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"09a78e2728019eacb554f66f1f5f226ba732b1e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,167,142,39,40,1,158,172,181,84,246,111,31,95,34,107,167,50,177,230]},"name":"So You Want to Talk About Race by Ijeoma Oluo EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
