Anthony Everitt constructs his history with unforgettable portraits of the talented, tricky, ambitious, and unscrupulous Athenians who fueled the city&apos;s rise. An unparalleled storyteller, Everitt combines erudite, thoughtful historical analysis with stirring narrative set pieces that capture the colorful, dramatic, and exciting world of ancient Greece. Although the history of Athens is less well known than that of other world empires, the city-state&apos;s allure would inspire Alexander the Great, the Romans, and even America&apos;s own founding fathers. It&apos;s fair to say that the Athenians made possible the world in which we live today. In this peerless new work, Anthony Everitt breathes vivid life into this most ancient story.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-08-23T12:02:30.688Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb4ae9378192f21b76aad68d961fed072197e377","dn":"The Rise of Athens by Anthony Everitt 2016 RETAiL ePUB eBOOK-DiS","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"bb4ae9378192f21b76aad68d961fed072197e377","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,74,233,55,129,146,242,27,118,170,214,141,150,31,237,7,33,151,227,119]},"name":"The Rise of Athens by Anthony Everitt 2016 RETAiL ePUB eBOOK-DiS","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
