Aging actress Arlene Iverson (Janet Ward) hires Harry to find her trust-funded daughter Delly (Melanie Griffith), distracting Harry from his marital problems as he tracks the lascivious runaway teen to Florida. In the Keys, Harry has an affair of his own with Paula (Jennifer Warren), and he succeeds in locating Delly, even as he learns that finding her is only the beginning of a much larger case. As the &quot;accidental&quot; deaths multiply, Harry discovers that everyone has his or her own motives and that he cannot do much to stem the tide of deep-seated depravity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTARS.........: Gene Hackman, Jennifer Warren, Melanie Griffith\r\nDIRECTOR......: Arthur Penn\r\nWRITERS.......: Alan Sharp\r\nGENRE.........: Crime, Mystery, Thriller\r\nTOMATOMETER...: 82%\r\nIMDB RATING...: 7.2/10  8,757 votes\r\nIMDB LINK.....: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073453\r\nRUNTIME.......: 1h 39mn\r\nSIZE..........: 3.63 GB\r\nVIDEO CODEC...: HEVC (<a href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection\" class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"9cd1fdf5f2dcd0a8\">[email&#xA0;protected]</a>)\r\nRESOLUTION....: 1920x1080\r\nASPECT RATIO..: 1.77:1\r\nBITRATE.......: 5000 Kbps (2-pass)\r\nFRAMERATE.....: 23.976 fps\r\nAUDIO.........: English AAC 1.0 192kbps VBR\r\nSUBTITLES.....: ENG\r\nCHAPTERS......: Yes\r\nSOURCE........: Blu Ray\r\nENCODED BY....: Sartre\r\nENCODE DATE...: 2017-09-18","last_updated":"2017-09-21T12:14:07.616Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:97d37e20166d8acf0a21c7c042b8baa75654ee4a","dn":"Night.Moves.1975.1080p.BluRay.HEVC.AAC-SARTRE","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"97d37e20166d8acf0a21c7c042b8baa75654ee4a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,211,126,32,22,109,138,207,10,33,199,192,66,184,186,167,86,84,238,74]},"name":"Night.Moves.1975.1080p.BluRay.HEVC.AAC-SARTRE","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
