Michael, married to a double divorc&#xE9;e, Natasha, the daughter of a Moscow lawyer, was the first Romanov murdered by the Bolsheviks, five weeks before the other mass killings, and because he was the Romanov who posed the greatest threat to them. However, they never admitted responsibility for his murder, pretending instead that he had escaped.\r\n\r\nThis book, based chiefly on original contemporary sources in Russia, tells you what the Soviet Union intended that you should never know. Does that matter now? Very much so, for unlike his brother Nicholas, Michael can serve as the bridge between today&#x2019;s Russia and Tsarist Russia, a gap which has yet to be closed. As Viktor Yevtukhov, appointed deputy Russian Minister of Justice in February 2011, has said: &#x2018;We should know more about this man and remember him, because this memory can give our society the ethical foundation we need&#x2019;. This book will tell you why, after almost a century, that should be so. From the tragedy of the past, a hope for the future&#x2026;\r\n\r\nPaperback: 396 pages\r\nPublisher: CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform (January 25, 2012)","last_updated":"2017-12-09T12:08:55.235Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ca0372e77703a792ee0d5702375d75e5e3858be","dn":"The Last Tsar: Emperor Michael II, the Man Soviet Russia Hid...","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"5ca0372e77703a792ee0d5702375d75e5e3858be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,160,55,46,119,112,58,121,46,224,213,112,35,117,215,94,94,56,88,190]},"name":"The Last Tsar: Emperor Michael II, the Man Soviet Russia Hid...","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
