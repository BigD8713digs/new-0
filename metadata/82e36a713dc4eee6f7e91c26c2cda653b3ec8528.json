The Authority of International Law: Obedience, Respect, and Rebuttal addresses these concerns by reviewing the present accounts of authority in international law constructing the authority of international law as imposing three different layers of duties on domestic officials: the duty to obey, the duty to respect and the duty to rebut, carefully setting out the duties owed by domestic political and legal authorities towards international law.\r\n\r\n---\r\n <a href=\"\nhttp://dlfeb.com/book/authority-of-international-law-obedience-respect-and-rebuttal/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttp://dlfeb.com/book/authority-of-international-law-obedience-respect-and-rebuttal/</a>","last_updated":"2017-07-23T12:01:04.225Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:82e36a713dc4eee6f7e91c26c2cda653b3ec8528","dn":"THE AUTHORITY OF INTERNATIONAL LAW: OBEDIENCE, RESPECT, AND REBU","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"82e36a713dc4eee6f7e91c26c2cda653b3ec8528","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,227,106,113,61,196,238,230,247,233,28,38,194,205,166,83,179,236,133,40]},"name":"THE AUTHORITY OF INTERNATIONAL LAW: OBEDIENCE, RESPECT, AND REBU","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
