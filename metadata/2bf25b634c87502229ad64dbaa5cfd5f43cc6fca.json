This task enables systems to connect to a network, as well as collect all component characteristics such as manufacturer and chipset.\r\n\r\nIf you intend to update the driver version, know that this process can add support for new OSes, fix different compatibility problems, resolve related errors encountered during the product&apos;s lifetime, as well as include various other changes.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to the actual installation procedure, we should note that most producers try to make it as easy as possible, so following the steps should be a breeze: just get the downloadable package, run the setup, and follow the on-screen instructions.\r\n\r\nThere is a chance that other OSes could also be suitable, but it is not advisable that you install this release on platforms other than the specified ones. Remember to perform a system reboot once done, to allow all changes to take effect properly.\r\n\r\nTherefore, if you wish to apply this version, click on the download button and enable your network card. To stay up to speed with the latest updates, check back with our website as often as possible.\r\n\r\nNOTES:\r\n\r\n- Huge file size.\r\n\r\n- Download smaller files for your operating system if you do not need software for every OS.\r\n\r\n- For users who need all files from Intel Network Connections CD.\r\n\r\n- Not all Intel Ethernet adapters and Intel Ethernet Controllers are supported under every version of Windows, Linux or FreeBSD","last_updated":"2017-11-11T12:04:41.008Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:2bf25b634c87502229ad64dbaa5cfd5f43cc6fca","dn":"Intel Ethernet Connections Drivers CD 22.9.0 {Latest} 2017","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"2bf25b634c87502229ad64dbaa5cfd5f43cc6fca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,242,91,99,76,135,80,34,41,173,100,219,170,92,253,95,67,204,111,202]},"name":"Intel Ethernet Connections Drivers CD 22.9.0 {Latest} 2017","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
