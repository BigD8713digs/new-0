On board were thirty barely clad black men, armed with cutlasses, and two white men - Spanish slave owners with an incredible story to tell.\r\n\r\nA month earlier, the Amistad had set sail from Havana with a valuable cargo of slaves and $40,000 worth of gold doubloons. She was headed for the Cuban coastal town of Puerto Principe - but in a matter of days, the captain and the cook were dead, and the ship was in the control of the slaves.\r\n\r\nThus began &quot;the Amistad affair,&quot; which, writes Mary Cable, &quot;was to bedevil the diplomatic relations of the United States, Spain, and England for a generation; intensify bitterness over the question of slavery; and lead an ex-president (John Quincy Adams) to go before the Supreme Court and castigate the administration in an eloquent plea for the slaves&apos; freedom. In her fascinating and carefully researched account, Cable takes us right to the heart of these complex matters, dramatically replaying an incredible series of events that converged to form a uniquely exciting and challenging chapter in American history.\r\n\r\nGenre: Non-Fiction &gt; History","last_updated":"2018-12-07T12:22:09.302Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d5f15b8ccf2b53f702c648393e6950693cc9294","dn":"The Case of the Slave Ship Amistad by Mary Cable (.ePUB)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"1d5f15b8ccf2b53f702c648393e6950693cc9294","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,95,21,184,204,242,181,63,112,44,100,131,147,230,149,6,147,204,146,148]},"name":"The Case of the Slave Ship Amistad by Mary Cable (.ePUB)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
