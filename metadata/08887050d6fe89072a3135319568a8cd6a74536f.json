With wry humor and moving testimony, Kevin Lacz tells the story of his tour in Iraq with SEAL Team Three, the warrior elite of the navy. This legendary unit, known as The Punishers, included Chris Kyle (American Sniper), Mike Monsoor, Ryan Job, and Marc Lee. These brave men were instrumental in securing the key locations in the pivotal 2006 Battle of Ramadi, told with stunning detail in this book.\r\n\r\nMinute by minute, Lacz relays the edge-of-your-seat details of his team&apos;s missions in Ramadi, offering a firsthand glimpse into the heated combat, extreme conditions, and harrowing experiences they faced every day. Through it all, Lacz and his teammates formed unbreakable bonds and never lost sight of the cause: protecting America with their fight.\r\n\r\nThe Last Punisher brings the reader into the life and mind of a SEAL, demonstrating the tough realities of war. At the same time, Lacz shares how these experiences made him a better man and how proud he is of his contributions to one of this country&apos;s most difficult military campaigns.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-08-23T12:02:07.973Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:08887050d6fe89072a3135319568a8cd6a74536f","dn":"The Last Punisher by Kevin Lacz 2016 RETAiL ePUB eBOOK-DiSTRiBUT","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"08887050d6fe89072a3135319568a8cd6a74536f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,136,112,80,214,254,137,7,42,49,53,49,149,104,168,205,106,116,83,111]},"name":"The Last Punisher by Kevin Lacz 2016 RETAiL ePUB eBOOK-DiSTRiBUT","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
