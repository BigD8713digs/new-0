When small-town girl Carrie Meeber sets out for Chicago, she is equipped with nothing but a few dollars, a certain unspoiled beauty and charm, and a pitiful lack of preparation for the complex moral choices she will face. Her story is one of struggle, from sweatshop to stage success, and of the love she inspires in a married man twice her age, whose obsession with her threatens to destroy him.\r\n\r\nDreiser reveals with powerful insight the driving forces of our culture: America&apos;s restless idealism, glamorous material seductions, and spiritual innocence.\r\n\r\nThe book&apos;s strengths include a brooding but compassionate view of humanity, a memorable cast of characters, and a compelling narrative line. It is a work of pivotal importance in American literature, becoming a model for subsequent American writers of realism.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-07-19T12:00:51.006Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:969a469a08548b09638eb4aef35050a716e07ab6","dn":"Sister Carrie by Theodore Dreisler epub RtR","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"969a469a08548b09638eb4aef35050a716e07ab6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,154,70,154,8,84,139,9,99,142,180,174,243,80,80,167,22,224,122,182]},"name":"Sister Carrie by Theodore Dreisler epub RtR","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
