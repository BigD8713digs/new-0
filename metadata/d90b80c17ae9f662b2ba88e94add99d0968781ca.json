A refugee mother uncertain of her future. Five little girls who brought them together. After nearly dying of breast cancer in her 20s, Sarah Thebarge fled her successful career, her Ivy League education, and a failed relationship on the East Coast and started over in Portland, Oregon. She was hoping to quietly pick up the pieces of her broken life, but instead she met Hadhi and her daughters, and set out on an adventure she&#x2019;d never anticipated. Hadhi was fighting battles of her own. \r\n\r\nA Somali refugee abandoned by her husband, she was struggling to raise five young daughters in a culture she didn&#x2019;t understand. When their worlds collided, Hadhi and the girls were on the brink of starvation in their own home, &#x201C;invisible&#x201D; in a neighborhood of strangers. As Sarah helped Hadhi and the girls navigate American life, her outreach to the family became a source of courage and a lifeline for herself. Poignant, and at times shattering, Sarah Thebarge&#x2019;s riveting memoir invites listeners into her story, finding connection, love, and redemption in the most unexpected places. \r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-04-23T12:02:38.470Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:d90b80c17ae9f662b2ba88e94add99d0968781ca","dn":"The Invisible Girls: A Memoir by Sarah Thebarge EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"d90b80c17ae9f662b2ba88e94add99d0968781ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,11,128,193,122,233,246,98,178,186,136,233,74,221,153,208,150,135,129,202]},"name":"The Invisible Girls: A Memoir by Sarah Thebarge EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
