It explains why offshore processing was re-established, what life is like for asylum seekers and refugees on Nauru and Manus. \r\n\r\nThat asylum seekers, refugees and staff in the offshore detention centres have to say about what goes on there, and why the truth has been so hard to find. In doing so, it goes behind the rumours and allegations to reveal what is known &#x2013; and what still is not known &#x2013; about Australia&#x2019;s offshore detention centres","last_updated":"2017-06-14T12:00:13.491Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf0e17604c51619d19d74537329952fcfe7ae746","dn":"Offshore: Behind The Wire On Manus And Nauru/Madeline Gleeson/20","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"bf0e17604c51619d19d74537329952fcfe7ae746","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,14,23,96,76,81,97,157,25,215,69,55,50,153,82,252,254,122,231,70]},"name":"Offshore: Behind The Wire On Manus And Nauru/Madeline Gleeson/20","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
