From this early age, he recognized that &#x201C;every film I saw, every play, every piece of music fed an unquenchable need to turn myself into something other than what I was.&#x201D;\r\n\r\nAn Improvised Life is Arkin&#x2019;s wise and unpretentious recollection of the process, artistic and personal, of becoming an actor and a revealing look into the creative mind of one of the best practitioners on the stage and screen. Arkin, in a manner that is direct, down-to-earth, accessible, and articulate, reveals not just insights about himself but truths for the rest of us about our sense of self, our work, and our relationships with others.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-01-25T12:09:22.252Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:02ff7aa5914de182664c2ede256b5b0071a27a86","dn":"An Improvised Life by Alan Arkin EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"02ff7aa5914de182664c2ede256b5b0071a27a86","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,255,122,165,145,77,225,130,102,76,46,222,37,107,91,0,113,162,122,134]},"name":"An Improvised Life by Alan Arkin EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
