But when a car accident reveals her husband&#x2019;s secret life as a serial killer, she must remake herself as Gwen Proctor&#x2014;the ultimate warrior mom.\r\nWith her ex now in prison, Gwen has finally found refuge in a new home on remote Stillhouse Lake. Though still the target of stalkers and Internet trolls who think she had something to do with her husband&#x2019;s crimes, Gwen dares to think her kids can finally grow up in peace.\r\nBut just when she&#x2019;s starting to feel at ease in her new identity, a body turns up in the lake&#x2014;and threatening letters start arriving from an all-too-familiar address. Gwen Proctor must keep friends close and enemies at bay to avoid being exposed&#x2014;or watch her kids fall victim to a killer who takes pleasure in tormenting her. One thing is certain: she&#x2019;s learned how to fight evil.
