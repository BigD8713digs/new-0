In this masterful book, David Starkey looks at the monarchy as a whole, charting its history from Roman times, to the Wars of the Roses, the chaos of the Civil War, the fall of Charles I and Cromwell&apos;s emergence as Lord Protector &#x2013; all the way up until the Victorian era when Britain&#x2019;s monarchs came face-to-face with modernity.\r\n\r\nThis brilliant collection of biographies of Britain&#x2019;s kings and queens provides an in-depth examination of what the British monarchy has meant, what it means now and what it will continue to mean. Bringing to life a cast of colourful characters, Starkey&#x2019;s trademark energy and authority make him the perfect guide on this epic, accessible and compelling journey, as he offers us a vivid portrait of British culture, politics and nationhood through an institution that has defined the realm for nearly two thousand years.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-08-25T12:00:42.838Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b9596c85f60aa75ccca581bf6f228360247601a","dn":"Crown and Country by David Starkey EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"9b9596c85f60aa75ccca581bf6f228360247601a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,149,150,200,95,96,170,117,204,202,88,27,246,242,40,54,2,71,96,26]},"name":"Crown and Country by David Starkey EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
