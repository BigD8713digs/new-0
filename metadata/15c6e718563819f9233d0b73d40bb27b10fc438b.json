Called the &quot;Bob Gates of his generation&quot;, Michael Morell is a top CIA officer who saw it all - the only person with President Bush on 9/11/01 and with President Obama on 5/1/11, when Usama Bin Laden was brought to justice. Like Ghost Wars, See No Evil, and At the Center of the Storm, The Great War of Our Time is a vivid, newsmaking account of the CIA, a life of secrets, and a war in the shadows.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-12-09T12:08:47.848Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:15c6e718563819f9233d0b73d40bb27b10fc438b","dn":"The Great War of Our Time by Michael Morell EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"15c6e718563819f9233d0b73d40bb27b10fc438b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,198,231,24,86,56,25,249,35,61,11,115,212,11,178,123,16,252,67,139]},"name":"The Great War of Our Time by Michael Morell EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
