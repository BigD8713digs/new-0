With this practical guide, author Matthew Kirk shows you how to integrate and test machine learning algorithms in your code, without the academic subtext.\r\n\r\nFeaturing graphs and highlighted code examples throughout, the book features tests with Python&#x2019;s Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, and SciPy data science libraries. If you&#x2019;re a software engineer or business analyst interested in data science, this book will help you:\r\n\r\nReference real-world examples to test each algorithm through engaging, hands-on exercises\r\nApply test-driven development (TDD) to write and run tests before you start coding\r\nExplore techniques for improving your machine-learning models with data extraction and feature development\r\nWatch out for the risks of machine learning, such as underfitting or overfitting data\r\nWork with K-Nearest Neighbors, neural networks, clustering, and other algorithms","last_updated":"2017-11-05T12:10:03.922Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3781412e855b75de79505e2baea68a2cc416c4d","dn":"Thoughtful Machine Learning with Python - Oreilly - 2017","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"c3781412e855b75de79505e2baea68a2cc416c4d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,120,20,18,232,85,183,93,231,149,5,226,186,234,104,162,204,65,108,77]},"name":"Thoughtful Machine Learning with Python - Oreilly - 2017","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
