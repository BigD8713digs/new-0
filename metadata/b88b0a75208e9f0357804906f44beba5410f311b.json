And yet a critical part of the puzzle, Shakespeare&#x2019;s library, is a mystery. For four centuries people have searched for it: in mansions, palaces and libraries; in riverbeds, sheep pens and partridge coops; and in the corridors of the mind. Yet no trace of the bard&#x2019;s manuscripts, books or letters has ever been found. \r\n\r\nThe search for Shakespeare&#x2019;s library is much more than a treasure hunt. Knowing what the Bard read informs our reading of his work, and it offers insight into the mythos of Shakespeare and the debate around authorship. The library&#x2019;s fate has profound implications for literature, for national and cultural identity, and for the global Shakespeare industry. It bears on fundamental principles of art, identity, history, meaning and truth.\r\n\r\nUnfolding the search like the mystery story that it is, acclaimed author Stuart Kells follows the trail of the hunters, taking us through different conceptions of the library and of the man himself. Entertaining and enlightening, Shakespeare&#x2019;s Library is a captivating exploration of one of literature&#x2019;s most enduring enigmas.\r\n\r\nHardcover: 336 pages\r\nPublisher: The Text Publishing Company (2018)","last_updated":"2018-09-22T12:36:23.992Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:b88b0a75208e9f0357804906f44beba5410f311b","dn":"Shakespeare's Library: The Greatest Mystery in Literature","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"b88b0a75208e9f0357804906f44beba5410f311b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,139,10,117,32,142,159,3,87,128,73,6,244,75,235,165,65,15,49,27]},"name":"Shakespeare's Library: The Greatest Mystery in Literature","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
