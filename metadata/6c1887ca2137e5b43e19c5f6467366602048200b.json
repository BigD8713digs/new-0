On the surface it may appear that Keke has it made, but under the success she has grappled with the same issues all young women wrestle with - identity, pressure, self-worth, love, sexuality, heartbreak, and family.\r\n\r\nWith this in mind, she created I Don&apos;t Belong to You &#x2014; an inspirational guide that encourages young people to change their mind-set and live with more freedom, confidence, and love as they navigate the rough terrain of the 21st century. Full of revealing stories from Keke&apos;s personal and professional lives, this book tackles twelve topics - sexuality, race, anxiety, success, bullying, and body image, to name a few - with refreshing honesty.\r\n\r\nWithin each chapter are quotes, texts, and song lyrics that have inspired her and practices that can help you stay on a path of always growing, never grown. With a voice of empathy, tough love, and determination, Keke speaks about the challenges and triumphs she has experienced on her journey to finding her own voice and creating a beautiful life. I Don&apos;t Belong to You is the motivation you need to move past pain and fear to lead a life full of creativity, spirituality, passion, and unlimited success.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-07-28T12:00:31.796Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c1887ca2137e5b43e19c5f6467366602048200b","dn":"Keke Palmer - I Dont Belong to You 2017 RETAiL ePUB eBOOK-DiSTRi","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"6c1887ca2137e5b43e19c5f6467366602048200b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,24,135,202,33,55,229,180,62,25,197,246,70,115,102,96,32,72,32,11]},"name":"Keke Palmer - I Dont Belong to You 2017 RETAiL ePUB eBOOK-DiSTRi","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
