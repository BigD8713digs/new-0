He just wants one thing first. The head of the American commando who killed his son in a raid two years ago.\r\nNewly-appointed Secretary of State Bill Mason isn&#x2019;t above sacrificing American lives to satisfy his ambition, so when al-Suri&#x2019;s back-channeled demand falls in his lap, he senses an opportunity to settle the score with his old nemesis, Delta Force squadron commander Kolt &#x201C;Racer&#x201D; Raynor.\r\n\r\nWhen Raynor gets the order to lead a mission into Syria to bag the new ISIS money man, his gut tells him something is fishy, especially since he has been ordered to personally lead the mission. Raynor doesn&#x2019;t mind leading from the front. In fact, he prefers it. But as soon as the assault team is on the ground, Kolt knows his gut instinct was dead on. The mission is a setup, an ambush intended to take out Raynor and his men.\r\nNow Raynor has a new mission: Find out who set him up and why. But to do that, Raynor and the Delta team will have to run the gauntlet&#x2014;an entire city controlled by enemy fighters.\r\n\r\nEnjoy and please SEED!!!","last_updated":"2017-09-02T12:05:11.686Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:03f331dd20965d1f518d573851f0ed364f7f3828","dn":"All Lines Black - Dalton Fury [EN EPUB MOBI] [ebook] [ps]","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"03f331dd20965d1f518d573851f0ed364f7f3828","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,243,49,221,32,150,93,31,81,141,87,56,81,240,237,54,79,127,56,40]},"name":"All Lines Black - Dalton Fury [EN EPUB MOBI] [ebook] [ps]","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
