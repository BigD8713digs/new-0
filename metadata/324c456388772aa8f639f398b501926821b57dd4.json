Deferred from military service, Chinaski travels from city to city, moving listlessly from one odd job to another, always needing money but never badly enough to keep a job. His day-to-day existence spirals into an endless litany of pathetic whores, sordid rooms, dreary embraces, and drunken brawls, as he makes his bitter, brilliant way from one drink to the next.\r\n\r\nCharles Bukowski&apos;s posthumous legend continues to grow. Factotum is a masterfully vivid evocation of slow-paced, low-life urbanity and alcoholism, and an excellent introduction to the fictional world of Charles Bukowski.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-07-10T12:00:52.185Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:324c456388772aa8f639f398b501926821b57dd4","dn":"Factotum by Charles Bukowski epub RtR","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"324c456388772aa8f639f398b501926821b57dd4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,76,69,99,136,119,42,168,246,57,243,152,181,1,146,104,33,181,125,212]},"name":"Factotum by Charles Bukowski epub RtR","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
