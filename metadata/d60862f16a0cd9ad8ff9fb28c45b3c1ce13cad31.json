The balcony of one of his beautiful music halls collapsed during a packed performance, killing dozens. Layton knows the flaw was not in his design; someone else must have caused the dreadful catastrophe. But with no proof and a hoard of furious Londoners screaming for blood, someone has to take the fall - and Layton finds himself facing a five-year prison sentence. \r\n\r\nWhen he is finally freed, Layton is determined to start over. With a new name and identity, he takes a job as a set painter. But as Layton begins to discover dead bodies hidden within theater halls across London, it soon becomes clear something darker is chasing him. \r\n\r\nWhen he unearths a clue that ties the bodies to the disaster that ruined him, he knows redemption is within his reach...unless the culprit gets to him first.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-10-16T12:01:56.233Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:d60862f16a0cd9ad8ff9fb28c45b3c1ce13cad31","dn":"The Fallen Architect by Charles Belfoure EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"d60862f16a0cd9ad8ff9fb28c45b3c1ce13cad31","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,8,98,241,106,12,217,173,143,249,251,40,196,91,60,28,225,60,173,49]},"name":"The Fallen Architect by Charles Belfoure EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
