Burroughs EPUB\r\n\r\nNaked Lunch is one of the most important novels of the 20th century, a book that redefined not just literature but American culture.\r\n\r\nThis is an unnerving tale of a narcotics addict unmoored in New York, Tangiers, and, ultimately, a nightmarish wasteland known as Interzone. The restored text includes many editorial corrections and incorporates Burroughs&apos;s notes on the text and several essays he wrote over the years about the book. For the Burroughs enthusiast and neophyte alike, this is a valuable and fresh experience of this classic of our culture.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-12-04T12:01:19.605Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:347b46783fb1d1f6647b2d98a6f5f4982122b2db","dn":"Naked Lunch_ The Restored Text by William S.
