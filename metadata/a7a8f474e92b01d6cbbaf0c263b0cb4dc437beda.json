It contains recipes from almost every nationality or ethnicity residing in the US and includes a brief introduction to understanding how those recipes represent that group&apos;s food culture. It illustrates the ways in which recipes, like identities, are fluid, adapting to new ingredients, tastes, and circumstances and are adjusted to continue to carry meaning-or perhaps acquire new ones. The book is based on the two-volume Ethnic American Food Today: A Cultural Encyclopedia, which looked at the way ethnic groups in the US eat. Here, the recipes of the varied groups are brought together for the adventurous chef, the curious reader, and the casual cook alike","last_updated":"2017-06-26T12:01:13.436Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:a7a8f474e92b01d6cbbaf0c263b0cb4dc437beda","dn":"Ethnic American Cooking: Recipes for Living in a New World by Lu","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"a7a8f474e92b01d6cbbaf0c263b0cb4dc437beda","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,168,244,116,233,43,1,214,203,186,240,194,99,176,203,77,196,55,190,218]},"name":"Ethnic American Cooking: Recipes for Living in a New World by Lu","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
