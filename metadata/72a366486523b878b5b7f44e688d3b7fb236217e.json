Will she be respectful toward Dr. Phil? Her mother, Cydney, claims she cannot control Dakota and has given up disciplining her teenage daughter. She says she has been forced to use physical violence in self-defense just to protect herself. How will Dr. Phil react to Cydney&#x2019;s parenting decisions? Plus, Dakota&#x2019;s father, John, blames Cydney for their daughter&#x2019;s behavior and comes face to face with Cydney for the first time in months. It&#x2019;s a reunion you won&#x2019;t want to miss","last_updated":"2017-11-20T12:01:53.077Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:72a366486523b878b5b7f44e688d3b7fb236217e","dn":"Dr.Phil.Show.2017.10.10-CBS","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"72a366486523b878b5b7f44e688d3b7fb236217e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,163,102,72,101,35,184,120,181,183,244,78,104,141,59,127,178,54,33,126]},"name":"Dr.Phil.Show.2017.10.10-CBS","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
