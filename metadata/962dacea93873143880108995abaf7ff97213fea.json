Fleeing Sweden and the old friends he has testified against, he abandons his name, his life, and his family to start over in Thailand. Ten years later and still with a price on his head, Rickard knows that a return home would be a death sentence. And so he ekes out his existence as a small-time crook in the back alleys of Phuket. Life&apos;s tough and dirty, but at least it won&apos;t kill him. But when his fifteen-year-old daughter Thyra comes looking for him, Rickard&apos;s self-imposed exile in this gritty paradise is soon under threat. His attempts to push her away only drive her deeper into the dark underworld that Rickard knows only too well","last_updated":"2017-08-24T12:01:37.548Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:962dacea93873143880108995abaf7ff97213fea","dn":"Farang (2017) - S01 E05 - 720p x264 - SWE (ENG SUBS) [BRSHNKV]","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"962dacea93873143880108995abaf7ff97213fea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,45,172,234,147,135,49,67,136,1,8,153,90,186,247,255,151,33,63,234]},"name":"Farang (2017) - S01 E05 - 720p x264 - SWE (ENG SUBS) [BRSHNKV]","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
