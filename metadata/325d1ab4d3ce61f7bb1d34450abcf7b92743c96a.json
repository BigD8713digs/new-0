Not only is the epic massive (70,000 verses in the constituted text, with approximately another 24,000 in the Vulgate) verses, but in its various recensions, versions, retellings, and translations it also presents a unique view of the history of texts, narratives, ideas, and their relation to a culture. Yet in spite of the fact that this text has been widely adopted as the standard Mah&#x101;bh&#x101;rata text by scholars, there is as yet no work that clarifies the details of the process by which this text was established. Scholars seeking clarification on the manuscripts used or the principles followed in arriving at the Critical Text must either rely on informal scattered hints found throughout academic literature or read the volumes themselves and attempt to follow what the editor did and why he did so at each stage.\r\n\r\nThis book is the first work that presents a comprehensive review of the Critical Edition, with overviews of the stemmata (textual trees) drawn up, how the logic of the stemmata determined editorial choices, and an in-depth analysis of strengths and drawbacks of the Critical Edition. Not only is this work an invaluable asset to any scholar working on the Mah&#x101;bh&#x101;rata today using the Critical Edition, but the publication of an English translation of the Critical Edition by Chicago University Press also makes this book an urgent desideratum.\r\n\r\nPublisher: Anthem Pr (June 29, 2018)\r\nISBN-10: 1783085762\r\n <a href=\"\nhttps://www.amazon.co.uk/Philology-Criticism-Mahabharata-Historical-Religions/dp/1783085762\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://www.amazon.co.uk/Philology-Criticism-Mahabharata-Historical-Religions/dp/1783085762</a>","last_updated":"2018-08-20T12:01:20.158Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:325d1ab4d3ce61f7bb1d34450abcf7b92743c96a","dn":"Philology and Criticism: A Guide to Mahabharata Textual Criticis","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"325d1ab4d3ce61f7bb1d34450abcf7b92743c96a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,93,26,180,211,206,97,247,187,29,52,69,10,188,247,185,39,67,201,106]},"name":"Philology and Criticism: A Guide to Mahabharata Textual Criticis","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
