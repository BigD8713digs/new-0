With it, the doctor-turned-journalist established himself as a seriously entertaining authority in the field of health. Now, in illuminating and genuinely funny prose, Hamblin explores the human stories behind health questions that never seem to go away - and which tend to be mischaracterized and oversimplified by marketing and news media. He covers topics such as sleep, aging, diet, and much more:\r\n\r\nCan I &quot;boost&quot; my immune system?\r\nDoes caffeine make me live longer?\r\nDo we still not know if cell phones cause cancer?\r\nHow much sleep do I actually need?\r\nIs there any harm in taking a multivitamin?\r\nIs life long enough?\r\n\r\nIn considering these questions, Hamblin draws from his own medical training as well from hundreds of interviews with distinguished scientists and medical practitioners. He translates the (traditionally boring) textbook of human anatomy and physiology into accessible, engaging, socially contextualized, up-to-the-moment answers. They offer clarity, examine the limits of our certainty, and ultimately help listeners worry less about things that don&apos;t really matter.\r\nIf Our Bodies Could Talk is a comprehensive guide that entertains and educates in equal doses","last_updated":"2017-05-23T18:51:57.053Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:83d7ee6a5c59129efea657a3a24ced0ae824209c","dn":"James Hamblin - If Our Bodies Could Talk 2016 RETAiL ePUB eBOOK-","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"83d7ee6a5c59129efea657a3a24ced0ae824209c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,215,238,106,92,89,18,158,254,166,87,163,162,76,237,10,232,36,32,156]},"name":"James Hamblin - If Our Bodies Could Talk 2016 RETAiL ePUB eBOOK-","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
