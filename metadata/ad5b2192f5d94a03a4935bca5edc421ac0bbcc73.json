The future is now. And the future is terrifying.\r\n\r\nThat&#x2019;s how Otherworld traps you. It introduces you to sensations you&#x2019;d never be able to feel in real life. You discover what&#x2019;s been missing&#x2014;because it&#x2019;s taboo or illegal or because you lack the guts to do it for real. And when you find out what&#x2019;s missing it&#x2019;s almost impossible to let it go again.\r\n\r\nThere are no screens. There are no controls. You don&#x2019;t just see and hear it&#x2014;you taste, smell, and touch it too. In this new reality, there are no laws to break or rules to obey. You can live your best life. Indulge every desire.\r\n\r\nIt&#x2019;s a game so addictive you&#x2019;ll never want it to end. Until you realize that you&#x2019;re the one being played. Welcome to Otherworld, where reality is dead. Step into the future. Leave your body behind.\r\n\r\nThe frightening future that Jason Segel and Kirsten Miller have imagined is not far away. Otherworld asks the question we&apos;ll all soon be asking: if technology can deliver everything we want, how much are we willing to pay?\r\n\r\nHardcover: 368 pages\r\nPublisher: Delacorte Press (October 31, 2017)\r\n\r\n\r\n <a href=\"\nhttps://pirates-forum.org/Forum-Requests\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://pirates-forum.org/Forum-Requests</a>","last_updated":"2017-12-11T12:06:17.910Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad5b2192f5d94a03a4935bca5edc421ac0bbcc73","dn":"Jason Segel and Kirsten Miller - Otherworld (Otherworld #1)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"ad5b2192f5d94a03a4935bca5edc421ac0bbcc73","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,91,33,146,245,217,74,3,164,147,91,202,94,220,66,26,192,187,204,115]},"name":"Jason Segel and Kirsten Miller - Otherworld (Otherworld #1)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
