As the growth of theatre blooms, their rivalry - and that of the playhouses, playwrights and actors vying for acclaim and glory - propels a high-stakes story of conflict and betrayal.\r\n\r\nShowcasing his renowned storyteller&apos;s skill, Bernard Cornwell has created an Elizabethan world incredibly rich in its portrayal: you walk the London streets, stand in the palaces and are on stage in the playhouses as he weaves a remarkable story in which performances, rivalries and ambition combine to form a tangled web of intrigue.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-10-23T12:02:54.205Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:12fd02b360a162b53841d95a535a2577270539ee","dn":"Fools and Mortals by Bernard Cornwell EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"12fd02b360a162b53841d95a535a2577270539ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,253,2,179,96,161,98,181,56,65,217,90,83,90,37,119,39,5,57,238]},"name":"Fools and Mortals by Bernard Cornwell EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
