Lib Wright, a veteran of Florence Nightingale&apos;s Crimean campaign, is hired to keep watch over the girl.\r\n\r\nWritten with all the propulsive tension that made Room a huge best seller, The Wonder works beautifully on many levels - a tale of two strangers who transform each other&apos;s lives, a powerful psychological thriller, and a story of love pitted against evil.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-10-06T12:02:41.364Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:cfde7b9d1cbf4d6b0e768d2b109272b35417b1e6","dn":"The Wonder by Emma Donoghue ePUB eBOOK-ZAK","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"cfde7b9d1cbf4d6b0e768d2b109272b35417b1e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,222,123,157,28,191,77,107,14,118,141,43,16,146,114,179,84,23,177,230]},"name":"The Wonder by Emma Donoghue ePUB eBOOK-ZAK","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
