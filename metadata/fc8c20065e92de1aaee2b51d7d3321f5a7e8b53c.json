It is a class pop song and should do well.\r\n\r\nAlong with the Maltese Entry by Christabelle - Taboo both songs are great value at the bookmakers right now with odds of 67 to 1 for the UK and over 2000 to 1 for tiny little Malta.\r\n\r\nAs a professional working in the Music industry since 1967 and supporting Eurovision since 1969 if you have a little cash to spare on a flutter these two are the best of this years crop as far as just sheer stick you our head re singability goes.
