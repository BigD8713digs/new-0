Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison) is comfortable in her life as a bail bonds collector when Henry -- the child she gave up a decade earlier -- suddenly shows up. He is convinced that she is the daughter of Snow White and Prince Charming, who sent her away before the Evil Queen could cast a spell, freezing the fairytale world in time and bringing them to present-day Storybrooke, Maine. After taking Henry home, Emma decides to stay in the town to keep an eye on him, and she discovers he may not be wrong after all.\r\n\r\nFirst episode date: 23 October 2011\r\nTheme song: Once Upon a Time theme song\r\nAwards: Teen Choice Award for Choice TV Actress: Fantasy/Sci-Fi, MORE\r\nProduction locations: Steveston, British Columbia, Vancouver","last_updated":"2017-12-16T12:04:59.052Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:f0ce6819ccc692984587d91b3b2691351afce5e2","dn":"Once.Upon.a.Time.S07E10.720p.HDTV.x264.[392MB]","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"f0ce6819ccc692984587d91b3b2691351afce5e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,206,104,25,204,198,146,152,69,135,217,27,59,38,145,53,26,252,229,226]},"name":"Once.Upon.a.Time.S07E10.720p.HDTV.x264.[392MB]","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
