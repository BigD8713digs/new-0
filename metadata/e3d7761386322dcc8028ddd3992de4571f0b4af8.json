Ragnar wants to head west, across the ocean, to discover new civilizations. With assistance from his friend Floki, Ragnar builds a faster, sleeker fleet of boats to help him make it to the Western world. Through the years Ragnar, who claims to be a direct descendant of the god Odin, continues to struggle with Earl until the two face each other in a final battle for supremacy. Following that, Ragnar goes on a search for new lands to conquer.\r\n\r\nFirst episode date: 3 March 2013\r\nTheme song: If I Had a Heart\r\nAwards: Canadian Screen Award for Best International Drama","last_updated":"2017-12-07T12:09:58.192Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3d7761386322dcc8028ddd3992de4571f0b4af8","dn":"Vikings.S05E03.720p.HDTV.x264.[397MB]","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"e3d7761386322dcc8028ddd3992de4571f0b4af8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,215,118,19,134,50,45,204,128,40,221,211,153,45,228,87,31,11,74,248]},"name":"Vikings.S05E03.720p.HDTV.x264.[397MB]","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
