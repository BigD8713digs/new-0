Composed in a lyrical language about South Asian themes and characters in a narrative that wandered through time, the semi-autobiographical work became the biggest-selling book by a nonexpatriate Indian author and won the 1998 Man Booker Prize for Fiction.\n\nBetween 1997 and 2017, Roy&apos;s literary output largely consisted of politically-oriented nonfiction, much of it aimed at addressing the problems faced by her homeland in the age of global capitalism and reflecting her involvement in environmental and human rights causes.  In recognition of her outspoken advocacy of human rights, Roy was awarded the Lannan Cultural Freedom Award in 2002, the Sydney Peace Prize in 2004, and the Sahitya Akademi Award from the Indian Academy of Letters in 2006.\n\nTHE MINISTRY OF UTMOST HAPPINESS, published in 2017, was her first novel in 20 years.  The work blends personal stories with topical issues as it uses a large cast of characters, including a transgender woman and a resistance fighter in Kashmir, to explore contemporary India.\n\nWith a very special thanks to @smaragdus!\n\n\nThe following books are in ePUB format unless otherwise noted: \n\n\n                                 == FICTION ==\n\n* God of Small Things, The (Random House, 1997/2008)\n\n* Ministry of Utmost Happiness, The (Penguin, 2017)\n\n\n                           == ESSAYS &amp; NON-FICTION ==\n\n* Algebra of Infinite Justice, The (Penguin, 2002) -- PDF\n\n* Capitalism: A Ghost Story (Haymarket, 2014)\n\n* Checkbook and the Cruise Missile, The: Conversations with Arundhati Roy (South End, 2004).
