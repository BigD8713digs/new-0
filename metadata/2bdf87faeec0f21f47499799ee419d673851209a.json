We had an interview arranged then, but David had to cancel due to an emergency; and several later attempts to reschedule it all met with logistical problems. Finally - over two years later! - we caught up with him in Sedona, and were able to sit down for a long conversation with him about his life and his work.\r\n\r\nPlease share this information far and wide, burn the video to DVDs or put it on USB thumbdrives and give them out to friends, family and others.\r\n\r\nPlease seed as long as possible, at least to a ratio of 1.100, thank you :)\r\n\r\nGeneral           : Project Camelot Interviews David Icke.avi\r\nFormat            : AVI at 416 kb/s\r\nLength            : 381 MiB for 2 h 8 min 21 s 267 ms\r\n\r\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 274 kb/s\r\nAspect            : 320 x 240 (1.333) at 15.000 fps\r\n\r\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 128 kb/s\r\nInfos             : 2 channels, 44.1 kHz\r\n\r\nScreens: <a href=\"\nhttps://extraimage.net/images/2018/08/20/68cfc72d5085bcee0e13cd5d327b67e5.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://extraimage.net/images/2018/08/20/68cfc72d5085bcee0e13cd5d327b67e5.png</a> <a href=\"\nhttps://extraimage.net/images/2018/08/20/f4e8aff757377750a61ae2bc3941b115.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://extraimage.net/images/2018/08/20/f4e8aff757377750a61ae2bc3941b115.png</a> <a href=\"\nhttps://extraimage.net/images/2018/08/20/81783407a1fd0647db10ef0f6dfcdb62.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://extraimage.net/images/2018/08/20/81783407a1fd0647db10ef0f6dfcdb62.png</a> <a href=\"\nhttps://extraimage.net/images/2018/08/20/eab3eccb6665df087061d1529502b948.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://extraimage.net/images/2018/08/20/eab3eccb6665df087061d1529502b948.png</a> <a href=\"\nhttps://extraimage.net/images/2018/08/20/71a89cce84f13b0c81c1d7a5e227b549.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://extraimage.net/images/2018/08/20/71a89cce84f13b0c81c1d7a5e227b549.png</a> <a href=\"\nhttps://extraimage.net/images/2018/08/20/4518dcf1d7591904dcc8646893e303d1.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://extraimage.net/images/2018/08/20/4518dcf1d7591904dcc8646893e303d1.png</a>","last_updated":"2018-08-20T12:13:25.619Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:2bdf87faeec0f21f47499799ee419d673851209a","dn":"Project Camelot Interviews David Icke","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"2bdf87faeec0f21f47499799ee419d673851209a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,223,135,250,238,192,242,31,71,73,151,153,238,65,157,103,56,81,32,154]},"name":"Project Camelot Interviews David Icke","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
