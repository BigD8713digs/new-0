At age 9 his musical talents were showcased in an interview on the TVOntario children&apos;s programme Cucumber. When he was 15, Jeff Healey formed the band Blue Direction, a four-piece which primarily played bar-band cover tunes. And it was on... \r\n\r\nLater...\r\n\r\nA perfect soundboard recording, and a great performance! Of note here, Healey&apos;s rendition of Neil Young&apos;s &quot;Like a Hurricaine&quot;, recorded for his &quot;Cover to Cover&quot; album but not included on that collection. Electric sets bookmark an all too short acoustic set that features a rendition of the blues classic &quot;Outskirts of Town&quot;. Dan Akroyd guests on Arthur Crudrup&apos;s &quot;Dig Myself a Hole&quot; at the encore. A fun show! \r\nAnd other Bonus tracks only in this analogkid share. Why? Cause I love the music and it&apos;s what I do.\r\n\r\nTracklist\r\nDisk 1\r\n\r\n01. My Little Girl.mp3\r\n02. Stop Breaking Down.mp3\r\n03. Mean And Evil.mp3\r\n04. Confidence Man.mp3\r\n05.
