Yalom EPUB\r\n\r\nBest-selling writer and psychotherapist Irvin D. Yalom puts himself on the couch in a lapidary memoir\r\n\r\nIrvin D. Yalom has made a career of investigating the lives of others. In this profound memoir, he turns his writing and his therapeutic eye on himself. He opens his story with a nightmare: He is 12 and is riding his bike past the home of an acne-scarred girl. Like every morning, he calls out, hoping to befriend her, &quot;Hello Measles!&quot; But in his dream, the girl&apos;s father makes Yalom understand that his daily greeting had hurt her. For Yalom, this was the birth of empathy; he would not forget the lesson. As Becoming Myself unfolds, we see the birth of the insightful thinker whose books have been a beacon to so many. This is not simply a man&apos;s life story; Yalom&apos;s reflections on his life and development are an invitation for us to reflect on the origins of our own selves and the meanings of our lives.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-10-21T12:01:03.969Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b2f12ac4b17531e2fadc34e656efe4801766f94","dn":"Becoming Myself_ A Psychiatrist's Memoir by Irvin D.
