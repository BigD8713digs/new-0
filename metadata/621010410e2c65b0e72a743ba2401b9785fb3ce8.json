There are three things you should know about me:\r\n1. I&#x2019;m in a coma.\r\n2. My husband doesn&#x2019;t love me anymore.\r\n3. Sometimes I lie.Amber wakes up in a hospital. She can&#x2019;t move. She can&#x2019;t speak. She can&#x2019;t open her eyes. She can hear everyone around her, but they have no idea. Amber doesn&#x2019;t remember what happened, but she has a suspicion her husband had something to do with it. Alternating between her paralyzed present, the week before her accident, and a series of childhood diaries from twenty years ago, this brilliant psychological thriller asks: Is something really a lie if you believe it&#x2019;s the truth?","last_updated":"2018-05-28T12:13:17.273Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:621010410e2c65b0e72a743ba2401b9785fb3ce8","dn":"Alice Feeney - Sometimes I Lie [audio]","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"621010410e2c65b0e72a743ba2401b9785fb3ce8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,16,16,65,14,44,101,176,231,42,116,59,162,64,27,151,133,251,60,232]},"name":"Alice Feeney - Sometimes I Lie [audio]","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
