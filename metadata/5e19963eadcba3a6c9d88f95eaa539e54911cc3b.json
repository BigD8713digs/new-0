Male dominance seems to them a universal, if not inevitable, phenomenon that has been with us since the dawn of our species. The essays in this volume offer differing perspectives on the development of sex-role differentiation and sexual inequality, but share a belief that these phenomena did have social origins, origins that must be sought in sociohistorical events and processes.&#x201D;\r\n\r\nIn this way Stephanie Coontz and Peta Henderson introduce a book which fills a yawning gap in Marxist and feminist theory of recent years.\r\n\r\nWomen&#x2019;s Work, Men&#x2019;s Property brings together specialist historical and anthropological skills of a group of American and French feminists to examine the origins of the sexual division of labor, the nature of pre-state kinship societies, the position of women in slave-based societies, and the specific forms taken by the oppression of women in archaic Greece.\r\n\r\nMen&#x2019;s Work, Women&#x2019;s Property will be welcomed by teachers and students of women&#x2019;s studies and anyone with an interest in the biological, psychological and historical roots of sexual inequality","last_updated":"2018-05-01T12:02:32.472Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e19963eadcba3a6c9d88f95eaa539e54911cc3b","dn":"Women's Work, Men's Property: The Origins of Gender and Class ","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"5e19963eadcba3a6c9d88f95eaa539e54911cc3b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,25,150,62,173,203,163,166,201,216,143,149,234,165,57,229,73,17,204,59]},"name":"Women's Work, Men's Property: The Origins of Gender and Class ","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
