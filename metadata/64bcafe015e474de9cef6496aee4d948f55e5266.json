Reduce the development time for your applications.\r\n    Understand the scope and power of STL features to deal with real-world problems.\r\n    Compose your own algorithms without forfeiting the simplicity and elegance of the STL way.\r\n\r\nBook Description\r\n\r\nBeginning with new language features, this book will help you understand the mechanics of the new language and offers insight into how it works. Unlike other books, ours takes an implementation-specific, problem-solution approach that will help you quickly overcome hurdles. You will learn the core STL concepts-such as containers, algorithms, utilities, lambda expressions, template tricks, and more-while working on practical real-world recipes. These recipes will help you get the most from the STL and show you how to program in a better way.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the book, you will understand the newer aspects of C++17 and will be able to overcome tasks that are time-consuming or deal-breaking while developing","last_updated":"2017-07-03T12:00:28.801Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:64bcafe015e474de9cef6496aee4d948f55e5266","dn":"C  17 STL Cookbook by Jacek Galowicz(2017) - MOBI/EPUB/PDF - zek","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"64bcafe015e474de9cef6496aee4d948f55e5266","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,188,175,224,21,228,116,222,156,239,100,150,174,228,217,72,245,94,82,102]},"name":"C  17 STL Cookbook by Jacek Galowicz(2017) - MOBI/EPUB/PDF - zek","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
