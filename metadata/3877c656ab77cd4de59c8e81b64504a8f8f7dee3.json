It involves pure &#x201C;stick n&#x2019; rudder&#x201D; demanding hand-type of flying in between mountains, without navigation instruments guidance, moderate or higher turbulence due to terrain, the FIR border just on the airport&#x2019;s pattern and tight turns short before lining up for last stage of final approach to land.\r\n\r\n\r\n&#x201C;I have operated for years into some really demanding airports such as Gibraltar, Innsbruck, Madeira, La Palma.
