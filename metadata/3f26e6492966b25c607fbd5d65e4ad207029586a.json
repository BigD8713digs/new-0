Minutes from the city, affluent without pretension, low crime with a friendly vibe - it&#x2019;s everything Kat never had, and that she&#x2019;s determined to provide for her infant daughter. Snagging a nice bungalow in this exclusive enclave was worth all the sacrifice. But everything changes overnight when Kat finds a scrawled note outside their front door.\r\n\r\nThat wasn&#x2019;t very neighborly of you.\r\n\r\nAs increasingly sinister and frighteningly personal notes arrive, each one stabs deeper into the heart of Kat&#x2019;s insecurities, paranoia, and most troubling, her past. When the neighbors who seemed so perfect reveal their open secret, the menace moves beyond mean notes. Someone&#x2019;s raising the stakes.\r\n\r\nAs suspicious as she is of every smiling face and as terrified as she&#x2019;s become of being found out, Kat is still unprepared for the sharp turn that lies just ahead of her on Bayberry Lane.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-05-09T12:01:00.115Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f26e6492966b25c607fbd5d65e4ad207029586a","dn":"Neighborly by Ellie Monago EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"3f26e6492966b25c607fbd5d65e4ad207029586a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,38,230,73,41,102,178,92,96,127,189,93,101,228,173,32,112,41,88,106]},"name":"Neighborly by Ellie Monago EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
