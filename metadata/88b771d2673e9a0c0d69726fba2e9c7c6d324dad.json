Her father, the renowned Dr. Reiner Klimke, was an Olympic rider himself, and he instilled his principles of training and riding with the good of the horse in mind in his daughter at a young age. Ingrid has furthered her father&apos;s esteemed legacy, modernizing two of the classic works by her father-the bestselling The New Basic Training of the Young Horse and Cavalletti-and tirelessly championing a balanced, fair, and caring system of training the horse that ensures his physical and mental well-being even while preparing him for the very top levels of international competition.\r\n\r\nAnd now Ingrid has written a book of her own, detailing her personal system of bringing a horse along through the stages of progressive development, and providing readers guidelines and exercises to ensure success without stress at each milestone. The result is surely a joyful partnership between rider and horse that will go the distance","last_updated":"2017-08-09T12:01:21.708Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:88b771d2673e9a0c0d69726fba2e9c7c6d324dad","dn":"Training Horses the Ingrid Klimke Way (2017) (Epub) Gooner","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"88b771d2673e9a0c0d69726fba2e9c7c6d324dad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,183,113,210,103,62,154,12,13,105,114,111,186,46,156,124,109,50,77,173]},"name":"Training Horses the Ingrid Klimke Way (2017) (Epub) Gooner","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
