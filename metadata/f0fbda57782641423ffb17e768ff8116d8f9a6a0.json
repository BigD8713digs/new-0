But what if we created a world in which we couldn&apos;t lie? In a radical experiment, pioneering scientists from across Europe have come together to make this happen.\r\n\r\nBrand new technology is allowing them to rig three British people to make it impossible for them to lie undetected. Then they will be challenged to live for a whole week without telling a single lie. It is a bold social experiment to discover the role of deception in our lives - to investigate the impact lying has on our mental state and the consequences of it for our relationships, and to ask whether the world would be a better or worse place if we couldn&apos;t lie.\r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC High L3.1\r\n * Video Bitrate: CRF 19 (~1989Kbps)\r\n * Video Resolution: 1280x720\r\n * Frame Rate: 25 FPS\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC-LC\r\n * Audio Bitrate: Q=0.46 VBR 48KHz (~125Kbps)\r\n * Audio Channels: 2\r\n * Run-Time: 59 mins\r\n * Part Size: 895 MB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Subtitles: Merged","last_updated":"2018-08-30T12:01:00.105Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:f0fbda57782641423ffb17e768ff8116d8f9a6a0","dn":"BBC Horizon 2018 A Week Without Lying 720p x264 AAC HDTV MVGroup","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"f0fbda57782641423ffb17e768ff8116d8f9a6a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,251,218,87,120,38,65,66,63,251,23,231,104,255,129,22,216,249,166,160]},"name":"BBC Horizon 2018 A Week Without Lying 720p x264 AAC HDTV MVGroup","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
