Despite his lack of formal education, he edited a weekly journal for 20 years, wrote 15 novels, five novellas, hundreds of short stories and non-fiction articles, lectured and performed readings extensively, was an indefatigable letter writer, and campaigned vigorously for children&apos;s rights, education, and other social reforms.\n\nDickens&apos;s literary success began with the 1836 serial publication of THE PICKWICK PAPERS.  Within a few years he had become an international literary celebrity, famous for his humour, satire, and keen observation of character and society.  Masses of the illiterate poor chipped in ha&apos;pennies to have each new monthly episode read to them, opening up and inspiring a new class of readers.  Dickens has been praised by fellow writers -- from Tolstoy to Orwell, Chesterton and Tom Wolfe -- for his realism, comedy, prose style, unique characterisations, and social criticism.  On the other hand, Oscar Wilde, Henry James, and Virginia Woolf complained of a lack of psychological depth, loose writing, and a vein of saccharine sentimentalism.\n\nNOTE: The novels and stories are available in many editions, most of which are simple undistinguished reprints.  To keep the size of this collection within manageable limits, I have included only those editions containing a significant scholarly apparatus (primarily Penguin Classics or Oxford World&apos;s Classics), with their excellent introductions and explanatory notes.\n\n\nThe following books are in ePUB format unless otherwise noted:\n\n\n                               == NOVELS ==\n\n* Barnaby Rudge (Oxford WC, 2003).
