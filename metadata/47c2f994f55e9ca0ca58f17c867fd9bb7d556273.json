And Business Is Good! (Bonus Boots Ed.) 1985ak\r\n\r\nThe album features the first of many covers performed by Megadeth: a speed metal version of Nancy Sinatra&apos;s classic &quot;These Boots Are Made for Walkin&apos;&quot;, with lyrics altered by Mustaine. The song sparked controversy in later years when the song&apos;s original author, Lee Hazlewood, deemed Mustaine&apos;s changes to be &quot;vile and offensive&quot; and demanded that the song be removed from the album. Under threat of legal action, the song was removed from all pressings released after 1995. In 2002, the album was re-released with a modified version of the song; the altered lyrics were censored because Hazlewood has not given permission to the band to release the cover in its original version. In the liner notes of the album&apos;s reissue, Mustaine was strongly critical of Hazlewood, noting that he received royalties for almost 10 years before objecting to the altered version.\r\n\r\nTracklist\r\n01 - Last Rites + Loved To Death.mp3\r\n02 - Killing Is My Business...And Business Is Good.mp3\r\n03 - Skull Beneath The Skin.mp3\r\n04 - These Boots.mp3\r\n05 - Rattlehead.mp3\r\n06 - Chosen Ones.mp3\r\n07 - Looking Down The Cross.mp3\r\n08 - Mechanix.mp3\r\n09 - Last Rites-Loved To Deth (Demo).mp3\r\n10 - Mechanix (Demo).mp3\r\n11 - The Skull Beneath The Skin (Demo).mp3\r\n12 - These Boots.mp3\r\n13 - These Boots.mp3\r\n14 - These Boots Are Made For Walking.mp3\r\n15 - These Boots.mp3\r\n\r\nThe extra Boots are from different live shows such as Donington and others\r\nAnd I dont think I included the hacked up and beeped over version he made up from all the post 1995 editions with the Boots.\r\nMade and posted by request from an old friend who was not finding the pre 1995 version","last_updated":"2018-01-28T12:12:07.242Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:47c2f994f55e9ca0ca58f17c867fd9bb7d556273","dn":"Megadeth - Killing Is My Business..
