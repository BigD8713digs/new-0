Following his untimely accident just before the festival in 2015, Dave Grohl promised to return to fulfil their commitment to headline. Much anticipation and excitement surrounds the band as we are there to see them come on stage and deliver one of their now customary epic live sets. It is the first time they have graced the stage since they last performed in 1998. Following Foo Fighters&apos;s epic live set, presenters Lauren Laverne and Huw Stephens carry on the Glastonbury late-night adventure with a delve into the nocturnal shenanigans that go on once the sun has set, plus some bespoke acoustic performances and the best of the rest from the second day of the festival.\r\n\r\n(with soft subtitles) \r\n\r\nFirst broadcast: 23-25 June 2017\r\nDuration:  4 hours","last_updated":"2017-06-25T12:00:25.469Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:c7db5e37fb35297fc554d7b72bbb6d8e6e1aa682","dn":"Glastonbury 2017 Day 2 Foo Fighters","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"c7db5e37fb35297fc554d7b72bbb6d8e6e1aa682","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,219,94,55,251,53,41,127,197,84,215,183,43,187,109,142,110,26,166,130]},"name":"Glastonbury 2017 Day 2 Foo Fighters","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
