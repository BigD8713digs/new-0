There are two main types of researches: quantitative research and qualitative research. If you look at the most of the researchers around yourself, their skills are often limited to quantitative research tools. This is mainly because qualitative researchers are still not part of the curriculum of many universities and institutions around the world. In case qualitative researchers are taught at masters or doctoral level they are presented in a very complex and esoteric manner making it very difficult for the students to comprehend the method of qualitative research. Research is all about methods and innovative ideas. You will always feel handicapped unless and until you learn the techniques on your own by right guidance and constant practice.\r\n\r\nWho is the target audience?\r\n    Research Analysts\r\n    PhD Students\r\n    Research Scholars\r\n    Corporate Research Professionals\r\n    University/College Teachers\r\n    Researchers Looking to Publish in High Impact Journals\r\n    Anyone willing to learn Qualitative Data Analysis\r\n    Data Analysts\r\n    Analytics Professionals working in Big Consultancy Firms\r\n    People Looking to Make a Career in Research and Analytics Field\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n    A copy of MAXQDA Software (Trial Version is Free)\r\n    A laptop/computer (MAXQDA runs on both Windows and Mac)","last_updated":"2018-07-12T12:07:45.705Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a58479e5d1d24c96c2c82e1de95b1487ddf1353","dn":"Qualitative Data Analysis using MAXQDA Analytics: Hands On!!","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"0a58479e5d1d24c96c2c82e1de95b1487ddf1353","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,88,71,158,93,29,36,201,108,44,130,225,222,149,177,72,125,223,19,83]},"name":"Qualitative Data Analysis using MAXQDA Analytics: Hands On!!","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
