They get an early morning call in the Ardeche before heading up the river in a kayak and caving their way to a very unusual wine cellar. Back at the villa, Jancis Robinson chooses her favourite wine of the two they bring back. Meanwhile, Joe Fattorini has been in Argentina to find out about a very successful immigrant and heads to Japan with top London brewer Jaega Wise to find out about sake.
