With recent changes to Java EE specifications, JEE application development has become a lot simpler. However, recent changes have also added many new specifications, some of which compete with existing JEE specification. Along with JEE specifications and APIs, it is also very important to understand the entire application development process and tools that can help simplify and accelerate JEE application development.\r\n\r\nThis guide provides a complete overview of developing JEE applications using Eclipse. The many features of the Eclipse IDE are explained. These enable the rapid development, debugging, testing, and deployment of JEE applications. You&apos;ll explore not just different JEE technologies and how to use them (JSP, JSF, JPA, JDBC, EJB, web services etc.), but also suitable technologies for different scenarios.\r\n\r\nThe book starts with how to set up the development environment for JEE applications and then goes on to describe many JEE specifications in detail, with an emphasis on examples. You&apos;ll learn how to deploy an example application on Tomcat and Glassfish Application Server.\r\n\r\nYou&apos;ll create a simple application that reads from a queue, processes the request, and publishes results to a topic and Eclipse MAT (Memory Analysis Tool) to debug memory issues","last_updated":"2017-07-18T12:02:27.003Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a7e874b6625b5ca834b809bf1abad1f1b48947a","dn":"Java EE Development with Eclipse, 2nd Edition by Ram Kulkarni - ","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"0a7e874b6625b5ca834b809bf1abad1f1b48947a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,126,135,75,102,37,181,202,131,75,128,155,241,171,173,31,27,72,148,122]},"name":"Java EE Development with Eclipse, 2nd Edition by Ram Kulkarni - ","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
