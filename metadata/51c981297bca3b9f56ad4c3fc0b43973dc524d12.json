Terra for Terrans!\r\n\r\nThey&apos;ve eased our problems. They&apos;ve raised our standards of living. Their science has shown us that everything we thought we knew about the universe was wrong. And now the alien Hyadeans&apos; high-tech gifts and their flair for social order promise to make a paradise of planet Earth.\r\n\r\nTo us, the Hyadeans seem a model of efficiency and clear thinking. But in Hyadean eyes, Earth&apos;s culture wallows in imagination and dreams, art forms, and concepts which would never have occurred to a citizen of their world. To some of the aliens, this demonstrates Earth&apos;s backwardness; others are increasingly fascinated by us.\r\n\r\nBut when a political assassination plunges his life into chaos, wealthy socialite and &quot;fixer&quot; Roland Cade discovers the dark underbelly of the alien presence. Our government obeys them. Our economy serves their wealthy masters. And the CounterAction &quot;terrorists&quot; on the news are truly fighting for freedom for Terrans and Hyadeans alike - and one of them is his ex-wife.\r\n\r\nSoon Cade is caught up in a terrifying adventure that will take him around the globe, and a conflict that will threaten to destroy the world as it turns American against American - and Hyadean against Hyadean. Cade will find friends in unexpected places - among the agents of CounterAction, and among the aliens themselves. But he will also face deadly enemies closer than he ever could have feared....\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-08-29T12:02:39.325Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:51c981297bca3b9f56ad4c3fc0b43973dc524d12","dn":"The Legend That Was Earth by James P Hogan ePUB MOBI eBOOK-ZAK","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"51c981297bca3b9f56ad4c3fc0b43973dc524d12","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,201,129,41,123,202,59,159,86,173,76,63,192,180,57,115,220,82,77,18]},"name":"The Legend That Was Earth by James P Hogan ePUB MOBI eBOOK-ZAK","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
