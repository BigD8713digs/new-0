On Gold Mountain was a national best seller and a New York Times Notable Book.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-11-04T12:01:25.841Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab2718cf62ac14a4dbab7b7d66e3a95b699b2631","dn":"On Gold Mountain by Lisa See EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"ab2718cf62ac14a4dbab7b7d66e3a95b699b2631","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,39,24,207,98,172,20,164,219,171,123,125,102,227,169,91,105,155,38,49]},"name":"On Gold Mountain by Lisa See EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
