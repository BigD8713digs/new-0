And sure, it&apos;s got some good things going for it: nice views, friendly inhabitants, good coffee. Air. But what if you want to get off?\r\n\r\nWhether you&apos;ve got itchy feet and need a bit of a break or you&apos;re looking for a complete change of scene, this book has all the information you&apos;ll need to leave, with free expert advice from the men and woman who can actually make it happen.\r\n\r\nDo I need a passport? How do I know if I have the right stuff? Can I take my dog? What spacesuit do I need? Where am I going to go? What am I going to eat?\r\n\r\nAs well as being a deeply impractical guide to getting off the planet, this is an eclectic mix tape of space travel stories - both real and imagined. From the migrating lunar geese that flew us to the moon in the 1600s to Elon Musk&apos;s wild plan to get humans to Mars en masse in the future, from the history of early rocket science to the Soviet tortoises that secretly won the space race.\r\n\r\nA collection for anyone who has looked up in wonder at the stars...and then wondered how to get there.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-10-07T12:01:04.235Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:9813ae7ad4e52825603012e1e6385b3881de0f38","dn":"Ad Astra_ An Illustrated Guide to Leaving the Planet by Dallas C","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"9813ae7ad4e52825603012e1e6385b3881de0f38","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,19,174,122,212,229,40,37,96,48,18,225,230,56,91,56,129,222,15,56]},"name":"Ad Astra_ An Illustrated Guide to Leaving the Planet by Dallas C","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
