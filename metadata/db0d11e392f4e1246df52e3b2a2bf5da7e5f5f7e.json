Sailors, not metallic superstructures and hulls, had won the battles and become the stuff of legend. Men like Commander Donald MacDonald, skipper of the USS O&apos;Bannon, who became the most decorated naval officer of the Pacific war; Lieutenant Hugh Barr Miller, who survived his ship&apos;s sinking and waged a one-man battle against the enemy while stranded on a Japanese-occupied island; and Doctor Dow &quot;Doc&quot; Ransom, the beloved physician of the USS La Vallette, who combined a mixture of humor and medical expertise to treat his patients at sea epitomize the sacrifices made by all the men and women of World War II.\r\n\r\nThrough diaries, personal interviews with survivors, and letters written to and by the crews during the war, preeminent historian of the Pacific theater John Wukovits brings to life the human story of the squadron and its men, who bested the Japanese in the Pacific and helped take the war to Tokyo.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-08-29T12:04:46.055Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:db0d11e392f4e1246df52e3b2a2bf5da7e5f5f7e","dn":"Tin Can Titans_ The Heroic Men and Ships of World War II's Most ","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"db0d11e392f4e1246df52e3b2a2bf5da7e5f5f7e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,13,17,227,146,244,225,36,109,245,46,59,42,43,245,218,126,95,95,126]},"name":"Tin Can Titans_ The Heroic Men and Ships of World War II's Most ","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
