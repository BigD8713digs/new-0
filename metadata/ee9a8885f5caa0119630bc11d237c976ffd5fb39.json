When there were no more titles to win and no more worlds to conquer, she retired and gave up her legend to history.\r\n\r\nNow the peace she carved for herself has been shattered by the unprovoked slaughter of her village. Seeking bloody vengeance, Zosia heads for battle once more, but to find justice she must confront grudge-bearing enemies, once-loyal allies, and an unknown army that marches under a familiar banner.\r\n\r\nFive villains. One legendary general. A final quest for vengeance.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-07-03T12:12:52.396Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee9a8885f5caa0119630bc11d237c976ffd5fb39","dn":"A Crown for Cold Silver by Alex Marshall EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"ee9a8885f5caa0119630bc11d237c976ffd5fb39","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,154,136,133,245,202,160,17,150,48,188,17,210,55,201,118,255,213,251,57]},"name":"A Crown for Cold Silver by Alex Marshall EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
