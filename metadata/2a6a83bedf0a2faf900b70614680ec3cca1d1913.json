But that suddenly changed after Ray Sprigle, a famous white journalist from Pittsburgh, went undercover and lived as a black man in the Jim Crow South.\r\n\r\nEscorted through the South&#x2019;s parallel black society by John Wesley Dobbs, a historic black civil rights pioneer from Atlanta, Sprigle met with sharecroppers, local black leaders, and families of lynching victims. He visited ramshackle black schools and slept at the homes of prosperous black farmers and doctors.\r\n\r\nThe Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reporter&#x2019;s series was syndicated coast to coast in white newspapers and carried into the South only by the Pittsburgh Courier, the country&#x2019;s leading black paper. His vivid descriptions and undisguised outrage at &quot;the iniquitous Jim Crow system&quot; shocked the North, enraged the South, and ignited the first national debate in the media about ending America&#x2019;s system of apartheid.\r\n\r\nSix years before Brown v. Board of Education, seven years before the murder of Emmett Till, and thirteen years before John Howard Griffin&#x2019;s similar experiment became the bestseller Black Like Me, Sprigle&#x2019;s intrepid journalism blasted into the American consciousness the grim reality of black lives in the South.\r\n\r\nAuthor Bill Steigerwald elevates Sprigle&#x2019;s groundbreaking expos&#xE9; to its rightful place among the seminal events of the early Civil Rights movement.\r\n <a href=\"\nhttps://worldimages.gallery/images/2017/07/03/img.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://worldimages.gallery/images/2017/07/03/img.gif</a>","last_updated":"2017-10-29T12:13:15.281Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a6a83bedf0a2faf900b70614680ec3cca1d1913","dn":"Bill Steigerwald - 30 Days a Black Man: The Forgotten Story","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"2a6a83bedf0a2faf900b70614680ec3cca1d1913","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,106,131,190,223,10,47,175,144,11,112,97,70,128,236,60,202,29,25,19]},"name":"Bill Steigerwald - 30 Days a Black Man: The Forgotten Story","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
