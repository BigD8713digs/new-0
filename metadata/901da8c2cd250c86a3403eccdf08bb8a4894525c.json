The game has a post-apocalyptic and retro-futuristic setting in the mid-22nd century, featuring an alternate history which deviates some time after World War II, where technology, politics and culture followed a different course.\r\nThe game is sometimes considered to be an unofficial sequel to the 1987 CRPG Wasteland, but it could not use that title as Electronic Arts held the rights to it; and, except for minor references, the games are set in separate universes. It was also intended to use Steve Jackson Games&apos; GURPS system, but that deal fell through due to the excessive amounts of violence and gore included in the game, forcing Black Isle to change the already implemented GURPS system to the internally developed SPECIAL system.\r\nCritically acclaimed, the game inspired a number of sequels and spin-off games, known collectively as the Fallout series.\r\n\r\nDeveloper(s)\tInterplay Entertainment[1]\r\nPublisher(s)\tInterplay Entertainment\r\nEdusoft (AR)\r\nDesigner(s)\tTim Cain\r\nLeonard Boyarsky\r\nChristopher Taylor\r\nComposer(s)\tMark Morgan\r\nSeries\tFallout\r\nEngine\tFallout engine\r\nVersion\t1.1 (21 November 1997)\r\nPlatform(s)\tMS-DOS, Microsoft Windows, Mac OS, Mac OS X\r\nRelease date(s)\tDOS/Windows\r\nNA 30 September 1997\r\nEU 1997\r\nMac OS\r\nNA 1997\r\nMac OS X\r\nNA 2002\r\nGameTap\r\nNA 24 July 2008\r\nOnLive\r\nNA 22 November 2011\r\nGenre(s)\trole-playing game, Open world\r\nMode(s)\tSingle player (first-person view)\r\nRating(s)\tESRB: M (Mature)\r\nUSK: 16 (cut)\r\nELSPA: 15+\r\nOFLC (NZ): R16\r\nOFLC (Au): M","last_updated":"2018-03-17T12:01:28.279Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:901da8c2cd250c86a3403eccdf08bb8a4894525c","dn":"Fallout 1 (Mac)   manual   reference card","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"901da8c2cd250c86a3403eccdf08bb8a4894525c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,29,168,194,205,37,12,134,163,64,62,204,223,8,187,138,72,148,82,92]},"name":"Fallout 1 (Mac)   manual   reference card","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
