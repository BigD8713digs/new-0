Perry EPUB\r\n\r\nMost folks associate the city of Salem, Massachusetts, with witches, but for Lee Barrett it&apos;s home. This October she&apos;s returned to her hometown - where her beloved Aunt Ibby still lives - to interview for a job as a reporter at WICH-TV. But the only opening is for a call-in psychic to host the late-night horror movies. It seems the previous host, Ariel Constellation, never saw her own murder coming.\r\n\r\nLee reluctantly takes the job, but when she starts seeing real events in the obsidian ball she&apos;s using as a prop, she wonders if she might really have psychic abilities. To make things even spookier, it&apos;s starting to look like Ariel may have been an actual practicing witch - especially when O&apos;Ryan, the cat Lee and Aunt Ibby inherited from her, exhibits some strange powers of his own.\r\n\r\nWith Halloween fast approaching, Lee must focus on unmasking a killer - or her career as a psychic may be very short lived.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-06-17T12:05:18.488Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd20c72d7a6c0b923645112a1217b0b672272799","dn":"Caught Dead Handed by Carol J.
