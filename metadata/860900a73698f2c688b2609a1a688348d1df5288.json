But how well do we really know The Great Gatsby? As Maureen Corrigan, Gatsby lover extraordinaire, points out, while Fitzgerald&apos;s masterpiece may be one of the most popular novels in America, many of us first read it when we were too young to fully comprehend its power.\r\n\r\nOffering a fresh perspective on what makes Gatsby great - and utterly unusual - So We Read On takes us into archives, high school classrooms, and even out onto the Long Island Sound to explore the novel&apos;s hidden depths, a journey whose revelations include Gatsby&apos;s surprising debt to hard-boiled crime fiction, its rocky path to recognition as a &quot;classic&quot;, and its profound commentaries on the national themes of race, class, and gender.\r\n\r\nWith rigor, wit, and infectious enthusiasm, Corrigan inspires us to re-experience the greatness of Gatsby and cuts to the heart of why we are, as a culture, &quot;borne back ceaselessly&quot; into its thrall. Along the way, she spins a new and fascinating story of her own.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-12-09T12:07:06.736Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:860900a73698f2c688b2609a1a688348d1df5288","dn":"So We Read On_ How the Great Gatsby .. by Maureen Corrigan EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"860900a73698f2c688b2609a1a688348d1df5288","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,9,0,167,54,152,242,198,136,178,96,154,26,104,131,72,209,223,82,136]},"name":"So We Read On_ How the Great Gatsby .. by Maureen Corrigan EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
