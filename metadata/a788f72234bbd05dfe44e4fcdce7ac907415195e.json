So begins this masterpiece of modern Russian fiction, a harrowing account of a man who has conceded to all things evil with dignity and strength.\r\n \r\nFirst published in 1962, One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich is considered one of the most significant works ever to emerge from Soviet Russia. Illuminating a dark chapter in Russian history, it is at once a graphic picture of work camp life and a moving tribute to man&#x2019;s will to prevail over relentless dehumanization","last_updated":"2018-03-15T12:10:48.025Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:a788f72234bbd05dfe44e4fcdce7ac907415195e","dn":"One Day in the Life of Denisovich.Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn.","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"a788f72234bbd05dfe44e4fcdce7ac907415195e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,136,247,34,52,187,208,93,254,68,228,252,220,231,172,144,116,21,25,94]},"name":"One Day in the Life of Denisovich.Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn.","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
