Ranging the mountains, prairies, rural villages, and urban ghettos of America, they discovered a wealth of unexpected talent - farmers, laborers, and ethnic minorities playing styles that blended the intertwining strands of Europe, Africa, Asia, and the Americas. Fortunately, thanks to the continuing efforts of cultural detectives and record devotees, the stories of America&apos;s earliest musicians can finally be told. Bernard MacMahon and Allison McGourty spent years traveling around the United States in search of recollections of those musical pioneers. Their fascinating account, written with the assistance of Elijah Wald, continues the journey of the series and features additional stories","last_updated":"2017-05-29T13:18:39.156Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:2667570be28739cc20401067822fd2a7867d12ef","dn":"Bernard MacMahon - American Epic 2017 RETAiL ePUB eBOOK-DiSTRiBU","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"2667570be28739cc20401067822fd2a7867d12ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,103,87,11,226,135,57,204,32,64,16,103,130,47,210,167,134,125,18,239]},"name":"Bernard MacMahon - American Epic 2017 RETAiL ePUB eBOOK-DiSTRiBU","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
