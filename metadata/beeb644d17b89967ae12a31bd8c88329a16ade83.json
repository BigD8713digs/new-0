It is first of all a work of literature; the descriptions of street life as a kind of ballet and the bitingly satiric account of traditional planning theory can still be read for pleasure even by those who long ago absorbed and appropriated the book&apos;s arguments.&quot;\r\n\r\nJane Jacobs, an editor and writer on architecture in New York City in the early 60s, argued that urban diversity and vitality were being destroyed by powerful architects and city planners. Rigorous, sane, and delightfully epigrammatic, Jacobs&apos;s small masterpiece is a blueprint for the humanistic management of cities. It is sensible, knowledgeable, readable, indispensable.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-11-05T12:00:44.560Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:beeb644d17b89967ae12a31bd8c88329a16ade83","dn":"The Death and Life of Great American Cities by Jane Jacobs EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"beeb644d17b89967ae12a31bd8c88329a16ade83","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,235,100,77,23,184,153,103,174,18,163,27,216,200,131,41,161,106,222,131]},"name":"The Death and Life of Great American Cities by Jane Jacobs EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
