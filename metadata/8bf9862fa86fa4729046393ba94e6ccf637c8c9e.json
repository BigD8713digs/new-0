Now \r\nelderly and senile, Thatcher spends much of her time in conversation with her \r\nhusband Denis, who is dead. Interspersed with her everyday life are snippets of her \r\nlife and political career. The middle class daughter of a grocer, she obtained a \r\ngood degree and developed an interest in politics. She was first elected in 1959 and \r\nquickly developed a reputation for dealing with difficult issues and showing herself \r\nmore than capable of taking on her male counterparts in the House of Commons. As \r\nPrime Minister, she takes on the very powerful unions seeing her popularity plummet \r\nuntil her patriotic response to Argentina&apos;s invasion of the Falkland islands leads \r\nto her re-election. In the longer term, her rigid approach with her colleagues leads \r\nto her downfall and the Conservative party ousts her from the leadership.\r\n\r\nInfo.\r\n=&gt;-Release Date : 2011.\r\n=&gt;-Language : English.\r\n=&gt;-File Size : 3.18 GiB.\r\n=&gt;-Overall bit rate : 4 342 kbps.\r\n=&gt;-Movie Runtime : 1h 44m.\r\n\r\nVideo.\r\n=&gt;-Codec : H.264/MPEG-4 AVC.\r\n=&gt;-Aspect Ratio : 2.35:1.\r\n=&gt;-Resolution : 1 920 x 816.\r\n=&gt;-Bit rate : 3 555 kbps.\r\n\r\nAudio 1 English.\r\n=&gt;-Codec : mp4a: MPEG-4 AAC LC.\r\n=&gt;-Channels : 2 channel.\r\n=&gt;-Bit Rate : 128 kbps.\r\n=&gt;-Maximum bit rate : 274 kbps.\r\n\r\nAudio 2 English.\r\n=&gt;-Codec : Digital Audio Compression AC-3.\r\n=&gt;-Channels : 6 channels-Front L C R, Side: L R, LFE.\r\n=&gt;-Bit Rate : 640 kbps.\r\n=&gt;-Bit rate mode : Constant","last_updated":"2018-10-12T12:30:54.405Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:8bf9862fa86fa4729046393ba94e6ccf637c8c9e","dn":"The Iron Lady - Biography 2011 Eng Subs 1080p [H264-mp4]","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"8bf9862fa86fa4729046393ba94e6ccf637c8c9e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,249,134,47,168,111,164,114,144,70,57,59,169,78,108,207,99,124,140,158]},"name":"The Iron Lady - Biography 2011 Eng Subs 1080p [H264-mp4]","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
