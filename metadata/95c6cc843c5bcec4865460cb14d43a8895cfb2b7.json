Fired by Richard&apos;s passion for the rich history of the dazzling Byzantine Empire - centred around the legendary Constantinople - we are swept into some of the most extraordinary tales in history. The clash of civilisations, the fall of empires, the rise of Christianity, revenge, lust, murder.\r\n\r\nTurbulent stories from the past are brought vividly to life at the same time as a father navigates the unfolding changes in his relationship with his son. Ghost Empire is a revelation: a beautifully told ode to a lost civilisation, and a warmly observed father-son adventure far from home.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-11-07T12:02:03.733Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:95c6cc843c5bcec4865460cb14d43a8895cfb2b7","dn":"Ghost Empire by Richard Fidler EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"95c6cc843c5bcec4865460cb14d43a8895cfb2b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,198,204,132,60,91,206,196,134,84,96,203,20,212,58,136,149,207,178,183]},"name":"Ghost Empire by Richard Fidler EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
