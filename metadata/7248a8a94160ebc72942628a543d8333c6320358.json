It can run off a USB flash drive, comes with a pre-configured web browser to protect your anonymity, and is self-contained (portable).\r\n\r\nWhat is Tor?\r\n\r\nTor is free software and an open network that helps you defend against traffic analysis, a form of network surveillance that threatens personal freedom and privacy, confidential business activities and relationships, and state security.\r\n\r\nWant Tor to really work?\r\n\r\nYou need to change some of your habits, as some things won&apos;t work exactly as you are used to.
