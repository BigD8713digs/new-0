Unlike the previous series, Hellboy in Hell is an ongoing series. The first four issues came out monthly as a part of a single arc, but going forward the series will have a sporadic release date with many arcs only being a single issue in length. Multiple-issue arcs will come out on a monthly schedule though.\r\n\r\nHellboy in Hell also marks the return of Mike Mignola as the ongoing artist for the character. He will write and draw all Hellboy in Hell stories himself.\r\n\r\nIn December 2015, Mike Mignola announced Hellboy in Hell would conclude at issue 10","last_updated":"2017-11-21T12:04:21.395Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:239b2a84b16ac14ceaa4e1e73bcebdfcadc341ca","dn":"2012 - Hellboy in Hell","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"239b2a84b16ac14ceaa4e1e73bcebdfcadc341ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,155,42,132,177,106,193,76,234,164,225,231,59,206,189,252,173,195,65,202]},"name":"2012 - Hellboy in Hell","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
