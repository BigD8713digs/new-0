The United States had to fight a war across two oceans and three continents - and to do so it had to build and equip a military that was all but nonexistent before the war began. Never in the nation&apos;s history did it have to create, outfit, transport, and supply huge armies, navies, and air forces on so many distant and disparate fronts.The Axis powers might have fielded better trained soldiers, better weapons, better tanks and aircraft. But they could not match American productivity. America buried its enemies in aircraft, ships, tanks, and guns; in this sense, American industry, and American workers, won World War II. The scale of effort was titanic, and the result historic. Not only did it determine the outcome of the war, but it transformed the American economy and society. Maury Klein&apos;s A Call to Arms is the first narrative history of this epic struggle, told by a master historian, and renders the transformation of America with a depth and detail never available before.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-01-26T12:00:54.303Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1dc30b1fa76b74e932734cdf49366dbd6697b38","dn":"A Call to Arms_ Mobilizing America for WWII by Maury Klein EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"a1dc30b1fa76b74e932734cdf49366dbd6697b38","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,220,48,177,250,118,183,78,147,39,52,205,244,147,102,219,214,105,123,56]},"name":"A Call to Arms_ Mobilizing America for WWII by Maury Klein EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
