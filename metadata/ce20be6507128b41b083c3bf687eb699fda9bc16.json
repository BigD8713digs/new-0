He explains how the mafia began, how it responds to threats and challenges, and introduces us to the real-life characters that inspired the American imagination for generations, making the mafia an international, larger than life cultural phenomenon. Dickie&apos;s dazzling cast of characters includes Antonio Giammona, the first &quot;boss of bosses&apos;&apos;; New York cop Joe Petrosino, who underestimated the Sicilian mafia and paid for it with his life; and Bernard &quot;the Tractor&quot; Provenzano, the current boss of bosses who has been hiding in Sicily since 1963.\r\n\r\nEpub format","last_updated":"2018-03-11T12:12:34.821Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce20be6507128b41b083c3bf687eb699fda9bc16","dn":"John Dickie - Cosa Nostra","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"ce20be6507128b41b083c3bf687eb699fda9bc16","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,32,190,101,7,18,139,65,176,131,195,191,104,126,182,153,253,169,188,22]},"name":"John Dickie - Cosa Nostra","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
