Rudolf, a charming bon vivant, is convinced it can: &quot;A woman has to feel that she must fight for her man in order to keep him. And most importantly, married women should not be bored!&quot; Rudolf, in his early sixties, successfully applies his wild theory in everyday practice with unflagging enthusiasm. He cannot fathom the naivety of his excruciatingly proper son-in-law Andrew, who for his zeal to fulfill his marital obligations does not realize how much his wife Alice is becoming bored. Loving father, and friendly father-in law, Rudolf offers some proven tips to Andrew on how to bring a new life into a moribund marriage. After all, it is for the happiness of his only daughter... From boring Andrew, thanks to an affair with beautiful Charlotte, becomes a confident lord of creation, doted on by his lover and admired by his wife. His position is great, but unsustainable. For one thing, the real lords of creation are of course women. Andrew faces a whirlwind of comedic situations with a disarming combination of typical male characteristics - a playful inventiveness and an indestructible hope that everything will end up well.\r\n\r\n\r\nLanguage: Czech\r\n\r\nSubs srt: Portuguese / English / Spanish / French\r\n\r\nGenre: Comedy / Romance \r\n \r\nFormat : AVI \r\nCodec ID : XVID \r\nFile size : 1.33 GB \r\nDuration : 1h 50min \r\nVideo bit rate : 1600 kb/s \r\nWidth : 1280 pixels \r\nHeight : 720 pixels \r\nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9 \r\nFrame rate : 25.000 FPS \r\nCodec ID/Hint : MP3 \r\nAudio bit rate : 128 kb/s","last_updated":"2017-11-01T12:04:06.170Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:bcff2733672236cb9ecdcd2af593779f532eba95","dn":"Muzi v Nadeji aka Men in Hope 2011 BRRip Sonata Premiere","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"bcff2733672236cb9ecdcd2af593779f532eba95","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,255,39,51,103,34,54,203,158,205,205,42,245,147,119,159,83,46,186,149]},"name":"Muzi v Nadeji aka Men in Hope 2011 BRRip Sonata Premiere","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
