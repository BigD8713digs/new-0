I did not have the Jackson Browne portion. I now have  obtained the Jackson Browne portion and have a complete source., I might as well post the whole thing. Both performances are fabulous must haves anyway. Thankx go to John from the new JDP blog he said that so well and It was true for me also. The Eagles show is pure Gold and Joe Walsh so fired up the set list. \r\nJackson Browne... this was his time to super shine in the late 70s.\r\n So Enjoy Some of the Best 70s Rock available\r\n.\r\n\r\nLong Play - (Mid Valley Records ~ MVR Special Sampler)\r\nHouston 1976 (Glenn Frey&apos;s Birthday) The Houston Summit, Houston, Texas, USA, 11-16-1976\r\nBBC In Concert 1978 Shepherd&apos;s Bush Theatre, London, London, UK\r\nSoundboard Recordings\r\nSources Vary\r\nMP3 320ak\r\nCover Art Included\r\n\r\nLineage: Mid Valley Special Sampler Boot 3CD &gt; EAC &gt; FLAC\r\nTracklist\r\n\r\nCD1 The Eagles\r\n01 Hotel California\r\n02 Lyin&apos; Eyes\r\n03 Wasted Time\r\n04 Take It To The Limit\r\n05 Desperado\r\n06 Midnight Flyer\r\n07 Turn To Stone (Joe Walsh)\r\n08 Already Gone\r\n09 Outlaw Man (Bonus)\r\n\r\nCD2 The Eagles\r\n01 One Of These Nights\r\n02 Funk #49 \r\n03 Good Day In Hell\r\n04 Rocky Mountain Way \r\n05 Witchy Woman\r\n06 James Dean\r\n07 M.C.
