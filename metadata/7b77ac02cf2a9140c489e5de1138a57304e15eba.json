Music composition wise there are no new proposals, in turn this band could be considered (if you are willing) true followers of TD&apos;s legacy, therefore this release could kind of fit in your Progressive Electronic collection in that same proportion.\r\nThe best part of this release, is when RMI sounds like RMI. Their true nature seems more inclined to surface in their semi Dark, drone like atmospheres, which in this record seem to work as overtures or closures for their stubborn and unimaginative TD&apos;s or ASHRA&apos;s renditions. The first 12 minutes will make my point crystal clear, but market wise, I can bet their followers would not be so thrilled.\r\nNow, if you, like me, are kind of bored with these endless repetitions of TD peak era styling and musical idiom involuntary/voluntary repetitions, well avoid it at all cost and spend your bucks on Tim Hecker if you were expecting a real Maelstrom (inevitably for me Edgar Allan Poe&apos;s short story is my referential point) , or on TD&apos;s or Ash Ra Tempel&apos;s 70s works, from where this UK trio were totally touched and inspired. - AdmireArt, progarchives.com","last_updated":"2017-07-02T12:03:15.311Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b77ac02cf2a9140c489e5de1138a57304e15eba","dn":"Radio Massacre International 1999 Maelstrom","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"7b77ac02cf2a9140c489e5de1138a57304e15eba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,119,172,2,207,42,145,64,196,137,229,222,17,56,165,115,4,225,94,186]},"name":"Radio Massacre International 1999 Maelstrom","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
