Any problems with \r\nthis packet are mine alone. \r\n\r\nDISCLAIMER: \r\nThese track selections are mine. \r\nSome are general consensus picks, while in other cases my \r\npreferences diverge from others&apos; (Kashmir, for example). \r\nDespite how dry they are in raw form, I&apos;ve stuck exclusively to \r\nsoundboard (or matrix) sources. Overall I prefer these sources \r\nwith some processing, to the available audience sources.\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIVIDUAL SOURCE INFORMATION:\r\nCologne, June 18: Winston Remasters Live Omega Series \r\nBrussels June 20: Winston Remasters Live Omega Series \r\nRotterdam, June 21: KRW_CO, 1st gen\r\nZurich, June 29: Weedwacker Soundboard series \r\nFrankfurt, June 30: Weedweacker, Soundboard Series\r\nMannheim, July 3: bluecongo, &quot;Mannheim Steamroller&quot;\r\nBerlin, July 7: Weedwacker, Soundboard Series\r\n\r\nLED ZEPPELIN:\r\nJimmy Page: Guitars\r\nRobert Plant: Vocals\r\nJohn Bonham: Drums\r\nJohn Paul Jones: Bass, Keyboards","last_updated":"2017-11-11T12:06:19.592Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:085f82d1b63c230cac4faec4c0ebacbbd127daa9","dn":"Led Zeppelin 1980 Tour Over Europe A Best Of Compilation FLAC","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"085f82d1b63c230cac4faec4c0ebacbbd127daa9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,95,130,209,182,60,35,12,172,79,174,196,192,235,172,187,209,39,218,169]},"name":"Led Zeppelin 1980 Tour Over Europe A Best Of Compilation FLAC","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
