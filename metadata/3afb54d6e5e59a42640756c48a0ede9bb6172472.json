Atomic Apocalypse. In the remaining 60 seconds before the explosion, you need to help your hero in his insane and tense search for family members and necessary supplies. Against you everything will turn around - time, your own furniture, a house that changes in every game and the most important question is - what to take with you and whom to leave? But getting in time and in good time to the shelter is just the beginning. All that you managed to collect, and all those who were saved, will be a decisive factor in the struggle for salvation. Each story of survival will be different, every new day will surprise you with new surprises. Do all these stories end well? It&apos;s up to you. Divide food and water, as best you can use the collected items, taking heavy decisions and making outings to radioactive wastelands","last_updated":"2018-09-30T12:08:09.369Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:3afb54d6e5e59a42640756c48a0ede9bb6172472","dn":"60 Seconds!
