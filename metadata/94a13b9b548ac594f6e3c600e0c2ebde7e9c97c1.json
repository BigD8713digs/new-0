So begins this most beloved of all American Zen works. Seldom has such a small handful of words provided a teaching as rich as this famous opening line of Shunryu Suzuki&apos;s classic. In a single stroke, the simple sentence cuts through the pervasive tendency students have of getting so close to Zen as to completely miss what it&apos;s all about. An instant teaching in the first minutes. And that&apos;s just the beginning.\r\n\r\nIn the 30 years since its original publication, Zen Mind, Beginner&apos;s Mind has become one of the great modern Zen classics. Suzuki Roshi presents the basics in a way that is remarkably clear and resonates with the joy of insight.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-01-22T21:40:13.773Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:94a13b9b548ac594f6e3c600e0c2ebde7e9c97c1","dn":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind by Shunryu Suzuki EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"94a13b9b548ac594f6e3c600e0c2ebde7e9c97c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,161,59,155,84,138,197,148,246,227,198,0,224,194,235,222,126,156,151,193]},"name":"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind by Shunryu Suzuki EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
