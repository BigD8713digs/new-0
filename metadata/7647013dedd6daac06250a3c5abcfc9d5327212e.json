Album of the Year is a concept record of sorts, one song for each month, each song a heart-rending essay of love found, lost, broken, or ripped apart, ranging from the puppy love &quot;Album of the Year&quot; to the depressed, resigned-to-loss &quot;A New Friend&quot; and &quot;Two Years This Month.&quot; Tim Kasher has found his voice, and almost all traces of previous Robert Smith-isms are gone; instead, he whispers, hollers, cajoles, and confesses in a voice stripped of artifice and plugged right into the listener&apos;s soul. The record is perfectly constructed. Based around acoustic guitars, the songs are colored in with keyboards, various percussion instruments, and glockenspiel, and made dramatic and often breathtaking. Songs like &quot;You&apos;re Not You&quot; and &quot;Album of the Year&quot; are pocket epics, created out of atmosphere and dynamic shifts in mood. Most of the songs are relatively downbeat, but a few, like &quot;Lovers Need Lawyers,&quot; show that the band can write snappy pop songs as well. Kasher&apos;s lyrics are incisive, personal, and about as honest-sounding as rock music can get","last_updated":"2018-01-01T12:03:10.874Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:7647013dedd6daac06250a3c5abcfc9d5327212e","dn":"The Good Life - The Album of the Year (2004) [16.44 FLAC]","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"7647013dedd6daac06250a3c5abcfc9d5327212e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,71,1,61,237,214,218,172,6,37,10,60,90,188,252,157,83,39,33,46]},"name":"The Good Life - The Album of the Year (2004) [16.44 FLAC]","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
