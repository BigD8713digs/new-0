I&apos;m a big surround music fan and made this album so I can listen it in surround through headphones on a portable player. The sources of this release are surround versions of the tracks ripped from the DVD except for the bonustracks, they are from the bonus CD from the Deluxe Edition. I&apos;ve converted them to virtual surround with Creative&apos;s BlasterX Acoustic Engine Pro. Using state-of-the-art technology, it gives an enhanced virtual 7.1 channel surround sound experience with regular stereo headphones.\r\n\r\nGenre: Rock, Blues\r\nStyle: Blues Rock, Acoustic\r\nRelease Date: Oct 15, 2013\r\nOriginal Release: Jan 16, 1992\r\nLabel: Reprise Records, Duck Records, MTV Music Television\r\nSource: DVD 48/16 5.1 DTS + CD 44.1/16 LPCM (Bonustracks)\r\nResampler: Adobe Audition\r\nSample rate: 44100 Hz\r\nBits per sample: 16\r\nCodec: FLAC\r\n\r\nUnplugged is a live album by Eric Clapton.It was recorded for the MTV Unplugged series and includes both the hit single &quot;Tears in Heaven&quot; and a heavily reworked acoustic version of &quot;Layla&quot;. Clapton performed the show in front of a small audience on 16 January 1992 at Bray Film Studios in Windsor, England. In addition to the final album tracks, the performance included early versions of &quot;My Father&apos;s Eyes&quot; and &quot;Circus Left Town&quot; along with &quot;Worried Life Blues&quot;. All tracks are included in this Deluxe Edition.\r\n\r\nClapton earned six Grammy Awards for the album, including Record of the Year, Album of the Year, Song of the Year, Best Male Pop Vocal Performance, Best Rock Male Vocal Performance and Best Rock Song. &quot;Tears in Heaven&quot; earned three of the six awards. The album reached number one on the Billboard 200, and has been certified Diamond by the RIAA for shipping over 10 million copies in the United States. In 2000 Q magazine placed Unplugged at number 71 in its list of the 100 Greatest British Albums. In October 2011, the album was ranked number nine on Guitar World magazine&apos;s top ten list of guitar albums of 1992.\r\n\r\nCommenting on the popularity of the album in his 2007 autobiography, Clapton wishes the reader to understand the great emotional toll he experienced around that time, and suggests that they visit the grave of his son Conor in Ripley to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\nTracklist:\r\n\r\n01.
