The technology, however, gives power to the quantum creature known as the varcolac, which slowly begins to manipulate Dr. Oronzi and take over his mind. Oronzi eventually becomes the unwilling pawn of the varcolac in its bid to control the world. The creature immediately starts attacking those responsible for defeating it 15 years earlier, including Sandra and Alex Kelley - the two versions of Alessandra Kelley who are still living as separate people. The two young women must fight the varcolac despite the fact that defeating it may mean resolving once again into a single person.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-05-07T12:04:25.229Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc7e281ccf9a7b95df30fbe55a3dab962f8c9075","dn":"Supersymmetry by David Walton EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"dc7e281ccf9a7b95df30fbe55a3dab962f8c9075","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,126,40,28,207,154,123,149,223,48,251,229,90,61,171,150,47,140,144,117]},"name":"Supersymmetry by David Walton EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
