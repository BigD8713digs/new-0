The problems are chosen almost exclusively from classical, non-quantum physics, but are no easier for that. They are intriguingly posed in accessible non-technical language, and require readers to select an appropriate analysis framework and decide which branches of physics are involved. The general level of sophistication needed is that of the exceptional school student, the good undergraduate, or the competent graduate student; some physics professors may find some of the more difficult questions challenging. By contrast, the mathematical demands are relatively minimal, and seldom go beyond elementary calculus. This further book of physics problems is not only instructive and challenging, but also enjoyable.\r\n\r\nAbout the Authors\r\nP&#xE9;ter Gn&#xE4;dig graduated as a physicist from E&#xF6;tv&#xF6;s Lor&#xE1;nd University (ELTE) in Budapest in 1971 and received his PhD in theoretical particle physics from the same university in 1980. Between 1985 and 2004, he was one of the leaders of the Hungarian team taking part in the International Physics Olympiad. Since 1989, he has been the physics editor for the Mathematical and Physical Journal for Secondary Schools. He is one of the authors of 200 Puzzling Physics Problems (Cambridge, 2001).\r\nGyula Honyek graduated as a physicist from E&#xF6;tv&#xF6;s Lor&#xE1;nd University (ELTE) in Budapest in 1975 and received his PhD from the same university in 1977. Between 1986 and 2011, he was one of the leaders of the Hungarian team taking part in the International Physics Olympiad. He is one of the authors of 200 Puzzling Physics Problems (Cambridge, 2001).\r\nM&#xE1;t&#xE9; Vigh graduated as a physicist from E&#xF6;tv&#xF6;s Lor&#xE1;nd University (ELTE) in 2010. He took part in the International Physics Olympiad as a contestant in 2003 and 2004. He has been one of the leaders and trainers of the Hungarian team since 2012.\r\nKen F. Riley read Mathematics at the University of Cambridge and gained a PhD in theoretical and experimental nuclear physics, before following a research career in particle physics. He was also Senior Tutor at Clare College, Cambridge and a University Lecturer at the Cavendish Laboratory, where he taught physics and mathematics for over forty years. \r\n <a href=\"\nhttps://s1.postimg.org/2099lue31b/200_More_Puzzling_Physics_Problems.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://s1.postimg.org/2099lue31b/200_More_Puzzling_Physics_Problems.jpg</a>","last_updated":"2017-10-09T12:05:17.201Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b9e6f093158670c292ee47cf8b4dd30f9adafd0","dn":"200 More Puzzling Physics Problems -  Hints   Solutions (gnv64)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"1b9e6f093158670c292ee47cf8b4dd30f9adafd0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,158,111,9,49,88,103,12,41,46,228,124,248,180,221,48,249,173,175,208]},"name":"200 More Puzzling Physics Problems -  Hints   Solutions (gnv64)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
