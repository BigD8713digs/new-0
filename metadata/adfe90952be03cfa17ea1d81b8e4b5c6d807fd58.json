There, the foreign visitors who filled hotels, clubs, offices, and embassies were acutely aware of the chaos breaking out on their doorsteps and beneath their windows.\r\n\r\nAmong this disparate group were journalists, diplomats, businessmen, bankers, governesses, volunteer nurses, and expatriate socialites. Many kept diaries and wrote letters home: from an English nurse who had already survived the sinking of the Titanic to the black valet of the US ambassador, far from his native Deep South, to suffragette leader Emmeline Pankhurst, who had come to Petrograd to inspect the indomitable Women&apos;s Death Battalion led by Maria Bochkareva.\r\n\r\nHelen Rappaport draws upon this rich trove of material, much of it previously unpublished, to carry us right up to the action - to see, feel, and hear the revolution as it happened to an assortment of individuals who suddenly felt themselves trapped in a &quot;red madhouse&quot;.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-09-15T12:02:24.156Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:adfe90952be03cfa17ea1d81b8e4b5c6d807fd58","dn":"Caught in the Revolution_ Petrograd, Russia, 1917 - A World on t","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"adfe90952be03cfa17ea1d81b8e4b5c6d807fd58","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,254,144,149,43,224,60,250,23,234,29,129,184,228,181,198,216,7,253,88]},"name":"Caught in the Revolution_ Petrograd, Russia, 1917 - A World on t","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
