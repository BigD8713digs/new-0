You fall out of touch which with a band for a couple of years \r\nand they start making smokestack lightning like this !! Don&apos;t mind the \r\nsinger at all (not that I really listen to Trower for the vocals). He&apos;s \r\ngot a cool bluesy voice that&apos;s smooth yet just a little gravelly. This \r\nthing ROCKS!!! and then &quot;Secret Place&quot; comes along and soothes you like \r\na cool summer breeze before Robin resumes opening successive cans of \r\nguitar whoop-ass until the end of the record. No one plays guitar like \r\nthis anymore. Jimi came first, Stevie Ray is gone. Robin is the last man \r\nstanding. Heavy Blues like no other in the universe just incredible guitar \r\nwork. Soulful, bluesy and rocking","last_updated":"2018-10-16T12:28:38.564Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:22015691b1967a88d18691fd22c260fb6104aa3f","dn":"Robin Trower 20 Century Blues 1994 Studio Album FLAC","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"22015691b1967a88d18691fd22c260fb6104aa3f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,1,86,145,177,150,122,136,209,134,145,253,34,194,96,251,97,4,170,63]},"name":"Robin Trower 20 Century Blues 1994 Studio Album FLAC","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
