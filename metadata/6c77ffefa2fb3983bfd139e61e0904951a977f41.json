Known also as the SA or Brownshirts, these &quot;ordinary&quot; men waged a loosely structured campaign of intimidation and savagery across the nation from the 1920s to the &quot;Night of the Long Knives&quot; in 1934, when Chief of Staff Ernst R&#xF6;hm and many other SA leaders were assassinated on Hitler&apos;s orders.\r\n\r\nIn this deeply researched history, Daniel Siemens explores not only the roots of the SA and its swift decapitation but also its previously unrecognized transformation into a million-member Nazi organization, its activities in German-occupied territories during World War II, and its particular contributions to the Holocaust. The author provides portraits of individual members and their victims and examines their milieu, culture, and ideology. His book tells the long-overdue story of the SA and its devastating impact on German citizens and the fate of their country.\r\n\r\nDaniel Siemens is associate professor, department of history, philosophy, and theology, Bielefeld University. He is author of three previous books and has published widely on European and U.S. history of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.\r\n\r\nHardcover, 504 pages\r\nPublished: October 24th 2017 by Yale University Press","last_updated":"2017-10-07T12:04:39.644Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c77ffefa2fb3983bfd139e61e0904951a977f41","dn":"Stormtroopers: A New History of Hitler's Brownshirts","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"6c77ffefa2fb3983bfd139e61e0904951a977f41","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,119,255,239,162,251,57,131,191,209,57,230,30,9,4,149,26,151,127,65]},"name":"Stormtroopers: A New History of Hitler's Brownshirts","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
