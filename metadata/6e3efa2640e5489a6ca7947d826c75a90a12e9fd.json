Bollyn, author of &#x201C;Solving 9/11: The Deception that Changed the World&#x201D;, traveled through the Middle East and studied the region&apos;s history and languages before earning a degree from the University of California at Santa Cruz with an emphasis on the history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Having worked as an independent investigative journalist from 2000-2006, Bollyn spent a great deal of time investigating the events of 9/11. In 2007, after having been attacked by undercover police at his home and forced into exile, he began writing &#x201C;Solving 9-11&#x201D;, which is dedicated to explaining what really happened and bringing the events of 9-11 into historical perspective. This is Christopher Bollyn&#x2019;s third live speaking engagement in Oregon, which took place on July 16th at Portland Community College&#x2019;s Sylvania campus.\r\n\r\nMPEG-4 (Base Media): 396MB, 47min 50s\r\n1 video stream: AVC\r\n1 audio stream: AAC\r\nOverall bit rate: 1 157 kb/s\r\n\r\nVideo:\r\n1 025 kb/s, 1280*720 (16:9), at 23.976 FPS, AVC\r\n\r\nAudio:\r\nEnglish, 126 kb/s, 44.1 kHz, 2 channels, AAC\r\n\r\nScreens: <a href=\"\nhttps://worldimages.gallery/images/2018/01/07/BU9XY.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://worldimages.gallery/images/2018/01/07/BU9XY.png</a> <a href=\"\nhttps://worldimages.gallery/images/2018/01/07/BUO2Q.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://worldimages.gallery/images/2018/01/07/BUO2Q.png</a> <a href=\"\nhttps://worldimages.gallery/images/2018/01/07/BU4BK.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://worldimages.gallery/images/2018/01/07/BU4BK.png</a> <a href=\"\nhttps://worldimages.gallery/images/2018/01/07/BUsP7.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://worldimages.gallery/images/2018/01/07/BUsP7.png</a>\r\n <a href=\"\nhttps://worldimages.gallery/images/2017/07/03/img.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://worldimages.gallery/images/2017/07/03/img.gif</a>","last_updated":"2018-01-08T12:03:47.562Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e3efa2640e5489a6ca7947d826c75a90a12e9fd","dn":"Christopher Bollyn 9/11 Question and Answer Session at Portland","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"6e3efa2640e5489a6ca7947d826c75a90a12e9fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,62,250,38,64,229,72,154,108,167,148,125,130,108,117,169,10,18,233,253]},"name":"Christopher Bollyn 9/11 Question and Answer Session at Portland","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
