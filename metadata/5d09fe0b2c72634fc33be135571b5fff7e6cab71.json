Feder [epub]\r\n\r\nPresenting &#x201C;the real deal&#x201D; of American antiquity &#x2014; as opposed to the hyped fare of many cable TV shows &#x2014; Kenneth Feder invites readers to explore the stunning technological, architectural, engineering, and artistic achievements of America&#x2019;s first peoples. \r\n\r\nPart travel guide, part friendly reference, Ancient America showcases fifty iconic and publicly-accessible sites located across the contiguous United States &#x2014;\r\n including monumental pyramids of earth, &#x201C;castles&#x201D; ensconced in cliff niches, and vast rock art galleries. Among the places profiled are four World Heritage Sites (Chaco Canyon, NM; Mesa Verde, CO; Cahokia, IL; Poverty Point, LA); numerous Historic Landmarks and National Monuments (including Crystal River, FL; Town Creek Mound, NC; Casa Grande, AZ; and Hovenweep, UT); and stunningly diverse sites ranging from Serpent Mound (OH) and Horsethief Lake (WA) to Canyon de Chelly (AZ) and Nine Mile Canyon (UT).\r\n\r\nIn addition to practical visitor information, Feder tells the fascinating stories of each site as revealed by archaeological research. Introductory chapters delve into the deep past of Native America; historical and cultural details as well as original photography round out the site entries. Readers will be inspired to visit these remarkable places where the past continues to resonate in the present","last_updated":"2017-05-24T11:47:21.722Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d09fe0b2c72634fc33be135571b5fff7e6cab71","dn":"Ancient America: Fifty Archaeological Sites to See for Yourself","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"5d09fe0b2c72634fc33be135571b5fff7e6cab71","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,9,254,11,44,114,99,79,195,59,225,53,87,27,95,255,126,108,171,113]},"name":"Ancient America: Fifty Archaeological Sites to See for Yourself","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
