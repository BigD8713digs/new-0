The book comprehensively describes the mathematical background and theorems about the invariants but a large part is also devoted to practical usage of moments. Applications from various fields of computer vision, remote sensing, medical imaging, image retrieval, watermarking, and forensic analysis are demonstrated. Attention is also paid to efficient algorithms of moment computation.\r\n\r\n---\r\n <a href=\"\nhttp://dlfeb.com/book/2d-and-3d-image-analysis-by-moments/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttp://dlfeb.com/book/2d-and-3d-image-analysis-by-moments/</a>","last_updated":"2017-06-15T12:00:24.493Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb8a42c483ee4c2eaa48098bdb7ae2e55f17fcbc","dn":"2D AND 3D IMAGE ANALYSIS BY MOMENTS","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"bb8a42c483ee4c2eaa48098bdb7ae2e55f17fcbc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,138,66,196,131,238,76,46,170,72,9,139,219,122,226,229,95,23,252,188]},"name":"2D AND 3D IMAGE ANALYSIS BY MOMENTS","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
