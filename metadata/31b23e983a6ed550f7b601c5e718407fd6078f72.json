He received his Ph.D. in Political Science from the University of California, Berkeley","last_updated":"2017-09-03T12:01:41.759Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:31b23e983a6ed550f7b601c5e718407fd6078f72","dn":"The CIA and the Politics of US Intelligence Reform/Brent Durbin/","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"31b23e983a6ed550f7b601c5e718407fd6078f72","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,178,62,152,58,110,213,80,247,182,1,197,231,24,64,127,214,7,143,114]},"name":"The CIA and the Politics of US Intelligence Reform/Brent Durbin/","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
