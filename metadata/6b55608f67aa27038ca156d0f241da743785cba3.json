He remains a thought leader on past and present Hollywood through his website and a social media presence that includes an activepage and a Twitter feed with more than 66,000 followers.\r\n\r\nIn Hooked on Hollywood, Maltin opens up his personal archive to take readers on a fascinating journey through film history. He first interviewed greats of Hollywood as a precocious teenager in 1960s New York City. He used what he learned from these luminaries to embark on a 50-year (and counting) career that has included New York Times bestselling books, 30 years of regular appearances coast-to-coast on Entertainment Tonight, movie introductions on Turner Classic Movies, and countless other television and radio performances. Early Maltin interviews had literally been stored in his garage for more than 40 years until Good Knight Books brought them to light for the first time in this volume to entertain readers and inform future film scholars. \r\n\r\nGenre: Non-Fiction &gt; Biographies &amp; Memoirs","last_updated":"2018-09-29T13:14:49.390Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b55608f67aa27038ca156d0f241da743785cba3","dn":"Hooked on Hollywood by Leonard Maltin (.epub)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"6b55608f67aa27038ca156d0f241da743785cba3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,85,96,143,103,170,39,3,140,161,86,208,242,65,218,116,55,133,203,163]},"name":"Hooked on Hollywood by Leonard Maltin (.epub)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
