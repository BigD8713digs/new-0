Five years later, as Herman lives out his last days, he shares his wisdom with his son, explaining that the person who controls the narrative of history controls their own fate. \r\n\r\nAfter his father dies and his mother disappears, Cornelius sets about reinventing himself - as Professor John Woman, a man who will spread Herman&apos;s teachings into the classrooms of his unorthodox Southwestern university and beyond. \r\n\r\nBut there are other individuals who are attempting to influence the narrative of John Woman, and they might know something about the facts of his hidden past.\r\n\r\nEngaging with some of the most provocative ideas of recent intellectual history, John Woman is a compulsively readable, deliciously unexpected novel about the way we tell stories and whether the stories we tell have the power to change the world.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-10-25T12:01:15.754Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:fec375e0ad67223dac497dd1e8cd9ff4f81e1975","dn":"John Woman by Walter Mosley EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"fec375e0ad67223dac497dd1e8cd9ff4f81e1975","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,195,117,224,173,103,34,61,172,73,125,209,232,205,159,244,248,30,25,117]},"name":"John Woman by Walter Mosley EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
