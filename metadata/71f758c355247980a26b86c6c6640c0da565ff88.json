Serving their communities and country the real life situations they find themselves in do not offer warm-ups or stretching sessions before the action starts. There are no do-overs if something goes wrong. Having the ability to respond quickly and effectively, with a body and mind capable of &#x201C;living to fight&#x201D; another day, is of the utmost importance. Having a quality of life to share with their families during and after their careers, is of even more importance. \r\n\r\nOriginal Strength for the Tactical Athlete presents the basic concepts behind the Original Strength System and applies them towards the life of a Tactical Athlete with the goal of allowing them to live their lives to their fullest potential. \r\n\r\nOriginal Strength for the Tactical Athlete explores some of the Original Strength RESETS and how to apply the workouts geared specifically for Tactical Athletes. Author Chad Faulkner shares his personal journey about how the RESETS have benefited him as a soldier, and how they could have made an impact, earlier in his career. If you consider yourself a Tactical Athlete (police, fire, EMS, military, etc.), train them, or aspire to be one, this is the book for you","last_updated":"2017-08-10T12:00:15.395Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:71f758c355247980a26b86c6c6640c0da565ff88","dn":"Original Strength for the Tactical Athlete (2017) (Azw3) Gooner","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"71f758c355247980a26b86c6c6640c0da565ff88","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,247,88,195,85,36,121,128,162,107,134,198,198,100,12,13,165,101,255,136]},"name":"Original Strength for the Tactical Athlete (2017) (Azw3) Gooner","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
