Harper EPUB\r\n\r\nA no-nonsense and helpful guide on how to cope with a slew of mental-health issues that are hell-bent on ruining the lives of millions of people worldwide\r\n\r\nOur brains do their best to help us out, but every so often they can be real assholes - having meltdowns, getting addicted to things, or shutting down completely at the worst possible moments. Your brain knows it&apos;s not good to do these things, but it can&apos;t help it sometimes - especially if it&apos;s obsessing about trauma it can&apos;t overcome. That&apos;s where this life-changing book comes in.\r\n\r\nWith humor, patience, science, and lots of good-ole swearing, Dr. Faith explains what&apos;s going on in your skull, and talks you through the process of retraining your brain to respond appropriately to the non-emergencies of everyday life, and to deal effectively with old, or newly acquired, traumas (particularly post-traumatic stress disorder).\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-10-22T12:10:33.162Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb1285f8281d2dc0f043e2dc38d3d57b7fa933c1","dn":"Unf--k Your Brain by Faith G.
