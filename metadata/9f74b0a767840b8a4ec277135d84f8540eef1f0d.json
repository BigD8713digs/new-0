She claims her son kills animals, stole the neighbor&#x2019;s dog, and crashed his grandfather&#x2019;s car!\r\n\r\nSherry says her elementary school son is a genius who opened a credit online and purchased over $750 in items. Sherry blames her son&#x2019;s behavior on his father, Todd, who she says lets their son do &#x201C;whatever he wants.&#x201D; Todd says his son is a &#x201C;normal boy that&#x2019;s a bit unruly.&#x201D; He says his son&#x2019;s behavior is a result of all the prescription medications that Sherry has had him on since he was 3 years old. Todd says Sherry doesn&#x2019;t have the patience to be a mother and is looking for &#x201C;quick fix solutions&#x201D; to their son&#x2019;s behaviors. Is there still hope for 8-year-old Douglas? Can these parents agree on a plan to help their son?","last_updated":"2017-11-20T12:02:06.108Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f74b0a767840b8a4ec277135d84f8540eef1f0d","dn":"Dr.Phil.Show.2017.10.13-CBS","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"9f74b0a767840b8a4ec277135d84f8540eef1f0d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,116,176,167,103,132,11,138,78,194,119,19,93,132,248,84,14,239,31,13]},"name":"Dr.Phil.Show.2017.10.13-CBS","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
