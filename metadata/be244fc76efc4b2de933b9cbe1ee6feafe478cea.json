Meanwhile, fishermen battle for survival in mountainous seas as they try to reap the current&apos;s natural fertility.\r\n\r\nE02 Mountains of the Deep \r\nIn the vast South Atlantic, huge pods of dolphins, massive penguin colonies and the largest gathering of marine mammals on earth pack chains of extraordinary islands, created by powerful volcanic forces far below them. Nutrient-rich upwellings create profusions of life in some areas, whilst extreme isolation and abyssal depths host a world of bizarre creatures in others.\r\n\r\nE03 From Heaven to Hell \r\nIn the balmy tropical Atlantic, everything from dolphins, manatees and whale sharks to sunbathing jellyfish thrive in the Caribbean&apos;s warm, sheltered waters, fringed with coral reefs and rich mangrove forests.  \r\n\r\nBut extreme heat in Africa unleashes terrifying hurricanes, causing chaos across the region.\r\n\r\n(with soft subtitles) \r\n\r\nFirst broadcast: July-August 2015\r\nDuration:  1 hour per episode","last_updated":"2017-06-15T12:05:34.511Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:be244fc76efc4b2de933b9cbe1ee6feafe478cea","dn":"Atlantic - The Wildest Ocean on Earth","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"be244fc76efc4b2de933b9cbe1ee6feafe478cea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,36,79,199,110,252,75,45,233,51,185,203,225,238,111,234,254,71,140,234]},"name":"Atlantic - The Wildest Ocean on Earth","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
