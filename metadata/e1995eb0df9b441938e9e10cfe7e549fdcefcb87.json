The son of a schooner captain, Jim never\r\n\r\nstrayed far from his marine roots despite choosing a career in journalism.\r\n\r\nFor fifteen years, Jim was host of the popular radio program the Fisheries\r\n\r\nBroadcast on CBC Radio in Newfoundland. After taking an early retirement\r\n\r\nfrom the radio business in 1997, Jim turned off the microphone and picked\r\n\r\nup a pen. He has written nine books with marine connections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJim has been contracted by several agencies and corporations such as Marine\r\n\r\nAtlantic, the Canadian Sealers Association, and Heritage Canada to draw\r\n\r\nfrom his marine knowledge, particularly in the fishing industry. In\r\n\r\nNovember 2002, Jim became managing editor of the Navigator, Atlantic\r\n\r\nCanada&apos;s premier fisheries and marine magazine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nISBN-13: 978-1771174817\r\n\r\nFlanker Press (July 7, 2016), 225 pages,\r\n\r\n\r\n <a href=\"\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30966782-the-call-of-the-ocean\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30966782-the-call-of-the-ocean</a>","last_updated":"2017-10-04T12:03:49.121Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:e1995eb0df9b441938e9e10cfe7e549fdcefcb87","dn":"The Call of the Ocean by Jim Wellman ","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"e1995eb0df9b441938e9e10cfe7e549fdcefcb87","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,153,94,176,223,155,68,25,56,233,225,12,254,126,84,159,220,239,203,135]},"name":"The Call of the Ocean by Jim Wellman ","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
