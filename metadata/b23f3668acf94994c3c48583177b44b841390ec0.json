No matter what sport, no matter what type of shooting, no matter what kind of camera you&#x2019;re using - You hope and expect your videos to look like your actual experiences! And what do you get instead? Shaky and distorted images&#x2026; But that was yesterday, this is today: You take care of the shooting, then Mercalli V4+ optimizes the footage for you! Video stabilizer, rolling shutter and CMOS correction for any action-cam, camera phone, or camcorder.\r\n\r\nAnd no matter whether it&#x2019;s the vehicle&#x2019;s engine vibration, or a bumpy surface, that&#x2019;s causing the faulty image: Mercalli handles jello, vibration, and distortion &#x2013; individually and in combination! Compared to a camera&#x2019;s internal stabilizer, Mercalli V4+ clearly produces the superior result and allows for a wider viewing angle.\r\n\r\nWith its additional features - comprehensive CMOS correction and further optimization in 3-axis-stablization - with Version 4+, you can expect the most powerful Mercalli yet.\r\n\r\nForget worrying about vibration, shakes, or complicated mounting devices. Don&#x2019;t get frustrated with expensive or heavy gyros or gimbals, which are not able to remove CMOS distortions and shorten battery life (if you&#x2019;re shooting from an aerial plane/copter) due to added weight. Don&apos;t bother with incam stabilization, which only decreases the video resolution, often does a sub-optimal job of stabilizing, and can&#x2019;t correct CMOS distortions.\r\n\r\nSimply mount the camera wherever you want on whatever you want and focus on getting that fantastic shot &#x2013; leave the stabilizing and distortion corrections to Mercalli V4 SAL+","last_updated":"2018-07-08T12:06:14.100Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:b23f3668acf94994c3c48583177b44b841390ec0","dn":"proDAD Mercalli V4 SAL  4.0.458.2 Multilingual Cracked","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"b23f3668acf94994c3c48583177b44b841390ec0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,63,54,104,172,249,73,148,195,196,133,131,23,123,68,184,65,57,14,192]},"name":"proDAD Mercalli V4 SAL  4.0.458.2 Multilingual Cracked","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
