Costa takes readers on a journey from Darwin&apos;s youth and travels on the HMS Beagle to Down House, his bustling home of 40 years.\r\n\r\nTo test his insights into evolution, Darwin devised an astonishing array of hands-on experiments using his garden and greenhouse, surrounding meadows and woodlands, even taking over the cellar, study, yard, and hallways of his home-turned-field-station.\r\n\r\nDarwin engaged his children, friends, and neighbors as assistants and encouraged fellow naturalists to follow his lead. His inventive experiments yielded universal truths about nature and evidence for his revolutionary arguments in On the Origin of Species and other watershed works.\r\n\r\nWe accompany Darwin in his myriad pursuits against the backdrop of his enduring marriage, chronic illness, grief at the loss of three children, and joy in scientific revelation. At each chapter&apos;s end, Costa shows how we, too, can investigate the wonders of nature at work, with directions on how to re-create Darwin&apos;s experiments.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-09-16T12:02:19.073Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:81ec676b3ef2fdf753df93a48df4903a5a6569c3","dn":"Darwin's Backyard_ How Small Experiments Led to a Big Theory by ","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"81ec676b3ef2fdf753df93a48df4903a5a6569c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,236,103,107,62,242,253,247,83,223,147,164,141,244,144,58,90,101,105,195]},"name":"Darwin's Backyard_ How Small Experiments Led to a Big Theory by ","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
