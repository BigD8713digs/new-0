Let me say it more clearly: 9 out of 10 WordPress sites never get completed!A lot of these sites were started by people who never even made their first post.

We&#x2019;ll leave the advanced concepts for some other time: the goal of this course is not to confuse you, but to walk you through the steps of building your very first WordPress site. The course gives you three options: build a WordPress site locally, on your computer, build a live website &#x2013; or both!You will learn, amongst other things, what localhosting is, how you can build your website locally without paying for hosting or domain. Once you&#x2019;ve done that, you can use your recently-installed WordPress to apply everything you&#x2019;re about to learn, so you don&#x2019;t have to pay hosting and domain fees while experimenting with WordPress.\r\nWho is the target audience?\r\n    Beginners who want to know more about WordPress.\r\n    Students who are interested in learning more about WordPress without having to pay for hosting.\r\n    Students who would like to understand the basics of WordPress and build a website.\r\nRequirements\r\n    No prior knowledge is required &#x2013; this course is designed with beginners in mind.\r\n    Internet connection is necessary","last_updated":"2018-07-17T12:04:56.016Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:dcddc5057913cda8afcf0c56ac4045ac70d2975b","dn":"Udemy - WordPress Academy: WordPress 101 For Beginners","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"dcddc5057913cda8afcf0c56ac4045ac70d2975b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,221,197,5,121,19,205,168,175,207,12,86,172,64,69,172,112,210,151,91]},"name":"Udemy - WordPress Academy: WordPress 101 For Beginners","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
