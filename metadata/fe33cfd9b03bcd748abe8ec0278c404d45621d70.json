Relating the history of the war as it developed, Anderson shows how the complex array of forces brought into conflict helped both to create Britain&apos;s empire and to sow the seeds of its eventual dissolution.\r\n\r\nBeginning with a skirmish in the Pennsylvania backcountry involving an inexperienced George Washington, the Iroquois chief Tanaghrisson, and the ill-fated French emissary Jumonville, Anderson reveals a chain of events that would lead to world conflagration. Weaving together the military, economic, and political motives of the participants with unforgettable portraits of Washington, William Pitt, Montcalm, and many others, Anderson brings a fresh perspective to one of America&apos;s most important wars, demonstrating how the forces unleashed there would irrevocably change the politics of empire in North America.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-07-02T12:13:21.996Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe33cfd9b03bcd748abe8ec0278c404d45621d70","dn":"Crucible of War by Fred Anderson EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"fe33cfd9b03bcd748abe8ec0278c404d45621d70","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,51,207,217,176,59,205,116,138,190,142,192,39,140,64,77,69,98,29,112]},"name":"Crucible of War by Fred Anderson EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
