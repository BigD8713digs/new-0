Based on the early Brahminic literature, namely the early Upanishads and Moksadharma, the author asserts the origin of the method of meditation learned by the Buddha from these teachers, and attempts to use them to identify some authentic teachings of the Buddha on meditation. \r\n\r\nStimulating debate within the field of Buddhist Studies, the following claims are put forward: \r\n\r\n* the Buddha was taught by Alara Kalama and Uddaka Ramaputta, as stated in the literature of numerous early Buddhist sects, is historically authentic \r\n\r\n* Alara Kalama and Uddaka Ramaputta taught a form of early Brahminic meditation \r\n\r\n* the Buddha must consequently have been trained in a meditative school whose ideology was provided by the philosophical portions of early Upanishads \r\n\r\nShedding new light on a fascinating aspect of the origins of Buddhism, this book will be of interest to academics in the field of Buddhist studies, Asian religion and South Asian studies. \r\n\r\n\r\nPublisher: Routledge; 1 edition (April 16, 2007) \r\nPublication Date: April 16, 2007 \r\nSold by: Amazon Digital Services LLC \r\nLanguage: English \r\nASIN: B000SEIF8C\r\n <a href=\"\nhttps://www.amazon.co.uk/Buddhist-Meditation-Routledge-Critical-Buddhism-ebook/dp/B000SEIF8C/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://www.amazon.co.uk/Buddhist-Meditation-Routledge-Critical-Buddhism-ebook/dp/B000SEIF8C/</a>","last_updated":"2018-09-08T12:10:00.266Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:a49146f98465b227bdb36500f51c79bbfb8a2f32","dn":"Alexander Wynne - The Origin of Buddhist Meditation - 2007 [epub","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"a49146f98465b227bdb36500f51c79bbfb8a2f32","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,145,70,249,132,101,178,39,189,179,101,0,245,28,121,187,251,138,47,50]},"name":"Alexander Wynne - The Origin of Buddhist Meditation - 2007 [epub","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
