Unfortunately, that &quot;normal&quot; includes collapsing skyscrapers, bands of bloodthirsty maniacs, and a dwindling cache of survival supplies. After watching his family, friends, and most of the non-sadistic elements of society crumble around him, Patrick decides it&apos;s time to cross one last item off his bucket list. He&apos;s going to Disney World.\r\n\r\nThis hilarious, heartfelt, gut-wrenching odyssey through post-apocalyptic America is a pilgrimage peppered with peril, as fellow survivors Patrick and Ben encounter a slew of odd characters, from zombie politicians and deranged survivalists to a milky-eyed oracle who doesn&apos;t have a lot of good news. Plus, it looks like Patrick may be hiding the real reason for their mission to the Magic Kingdom.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-12-10T12:04:57.138Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:a172745af3c0473f55d4fadb172344fc5b369e37","dn":"Apocalypticon by Clayton Smith EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"a172745af3c0473f55d4fadb172344fc5b369e37","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,114,116,90,243,192,71,63,85,212,250,219,23,35,68,252,91,54,158,55]},"name":"Apocalypticon by Clayton Smith EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
