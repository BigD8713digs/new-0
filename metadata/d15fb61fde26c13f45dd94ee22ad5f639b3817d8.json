What, in the form of Balmorhea, was there left to say? And did they have the energy to say it? \r\nStranger, the group&#x2019;s maximalist, genre-leaping full-length from 2012, had already seemed to trace the group&#x2019;s farthest bounds. And, over the years, they&#x2019;d worked with a roving cast of accomplished string and rhythm players to craft a glassy-eyed, sage-brushed, instrumental Americana that, while celebrated in The New Yorker, Pitchfork and The Atlantic, among myriad other press, and attracting the film, ad, and television worlds risked pigeonholing them for good. As they had in the beginning, in 2006, Muller and Lowe worked simply and with restraint, letting intuition guide them as they molded the 10 elegant, spacious gestures that comprise Clear Language. A relaxed, clear-eyed wonder tumbles through these songs like herons lancing through Kerouac&#x2019;s &#x201C;hungermaking&#x201D; fog. Clear Language is the sound of two friends transmitting unfettered meaning in a milieu choked by double-speak at every turn. \r\n\r\nTracklist: \r\n1. Clear Language \r\n2. Sky Could Undress \r\n3.
