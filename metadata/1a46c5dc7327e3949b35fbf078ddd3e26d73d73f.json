Within these sections appear many of his concepts which have found their way into the wider consciousness of modern man - the key role of sex in forming our thoughts and behavior, the Oedipus complex, the libido, sublimation, fixation, regression and suppression and the unconscious. He was determined to show how psychoanalysis could help reveal the causes of neuroses and lead to clarity for the patient - as opposed to the approach taken by psychiatrists.\r\n\r\nFreud refers to his early use of hypnotism, which he later discarded, and many more steps which led him to his conclusions that the powerful part played by sexual impulses, often dating back to childhood, pursued individuals into adulthood","last_updated":"2017-06-22T12:01:01.890Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a46c5dc7327e3949b35fbf078ddd3e26d73d73f","dn":"Sigmund Freud--General Introduction To Psychoanalysis 2015 Retai","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"1a46c5dc7327e3949b35fbf078ddd3e26d73d73f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,70,197,220,115,39,227,148,155,53,251,240,120,221,211,226,109,115,215,63]},"name":"Sigmund Freud--General Introduction To Psychoanalysis 2015 Retai","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
