Ross is reintroduced to Tholly Tregirls, an old friend of his father&apos;s and a ne&apos;er-do-well who has returned to area. Verity returns to Trenwith, awaiting word from her husband, Andrew, whose ship is en route to Lisbon, while Elizabeth feels the sting of Morwenna and Geoffrey Charles&apos;s connection. \r\n\r\nThe Carnes disobey Ross by crossing Trenwith land and Drake gives Morwenna winter primroses. Ross learns that Andrew&apos;s ship is missing and Dwight&apos;s has been lost in combat so he puts out word along the coast, seeking information for a reward. Sam&apos;s flock provoke George, so George has Odgers ban them from church. Ross, Demelza, Verity and Caroline attend Basset&apos;s gathering, where several French nobles are staying, to learn of the vessels&apos; fates. \r\n\r\nDrake shows Morwenna and Geoffrey Charles a holy well of fresh water by the beach and Reverend Halse offers Ross the magistracy role, but Ross refuses and it is given to George. Caroline discovers that Andrew is safe, but Ross tells Demelza he fears the worst for Dwight. Tholly arrives with information and Ross sails for France with him as Dwight faces execution and Verity leaves for Lisbon for good.\r\n\r\n(with soft subtitles) \r\n\r\nFirst broadcast: 18 June 2017\r\nDuration:  1 hour","last_updated":"2017-06-19T12:06:02.467Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:908ebad3c9bdffc62d7e04e7bca930fe60b44f0f","dn":"Poldark S03E02","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"908ebad3c9bdffc62d7e04e7bca930fe60b44f0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,142,186,211,201,189,255,198,45,126,4,231,188,169,48,254,96,180,79,15]},"name":"Poldark S03E02","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
