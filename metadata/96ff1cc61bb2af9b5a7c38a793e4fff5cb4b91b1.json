She would be eight years old now&#x2014;if she has survived. Desperate to find their beloved daughter, certain someone took her, the Culvers turn to Naomi, a private investigator with an uncanny talent for locating the lost and missing. Known to the police and a select group of parents as The Child Finder, Naomi is their last hope.\r\n\r\nNaomi&#x2019;s methodical search takes her deep into the icy, mysterious forest in the Pacific Northwest, and into her own fragmented past. She understands children like Madison because once upon a time, she was a lost girl too.\r\n\r\nAs Naomi relentlessly pursues and slowly uncovers the truth behind Madison&#x2019;s disappearance, shards of a dark dream pierce the defenses that have protected her, reminding her of a terrible loss she feels but cannot remember. If she finds Madison, will Naomi ultimately unlock the secrets of her own life?","last_updated":"2017-11-12T12:03:26.580Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:96ff1cc61bb2af9b5a7c38a793e4fff5cb4b91b1","dn":"Rene Denfeld-The Child Finder(EPUB)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"96ff1cc61bb2af9b5a7c38a793e4fff5cb4b91b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,255,28,198,27,178,175,155,90,124,56,167,147,228,255,245,203,75,145,177]},"name":"Rene Denfeld-The Child Finder(EPUB)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
