At a minimum you can just choose the drive you&apos;d like to assess (standard hard drives are supported, including network drives, but USB and optical drives are not), hit &quot;All!&quot;, and wait for the tests to run.\r\nOnce the benchmark is complete, you&apos;re presented with read and write speeds in MB/s for each of the four tests (or just the one you selected). \r\nYour results may be saved to disk or copied to the clipboard for reuse elsewhere. \r\n\r\nHow to Install: \r\n1). Instructions are included in ReadMe.txt if needed. \r\n2). Thats all, Done &amp; enjoy","last_updated":"2017-08-01T12:01:15.398Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:4a0044b2c675bcf4e7f445e72323a0931dbf51c2","dn":"CrystalDiskMark 5.2.2   Portable   license - Crackingpatching","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"4a0044b2c675bcf4e7f445e72323a0931dbf51c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,0,68,178,198,117,188,244,231,244,69,231,35,35,160,147,29,191,81,194]},"name":"CrystalDiskMark 5.2.2   Portable   license - Crackingpatching","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
