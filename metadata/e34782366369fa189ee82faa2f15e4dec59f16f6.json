While taking the New Testament as a portal into the biblical canon, he seeks to preserve the distinct voices of Israel&apos;s Scriptures, accepting even its irregular and sinewed pieces as features rather than problems. Goldingay does not search out a thematic core or overarching unity, but allows Scripture&apos;s diversity and tensions to remain as manifold witnesses to the ways of God.\r\n\r\nWhile many interpreters interrogate Scripture under the harsh lights of late-modern questions, Goldingay engages in a dialogue keen on letting Scripture speak to us in its own voice. Throughout he asks, &quot;What understanding of God and the world and life emerges from these two testaments?&quot;\r\n\r\nGoldingay&apos;s Biblical Theology is a landmark achievement&#x2015;hermeneutically dexterous, biblically expansive, and nourishing to mind, soul and proclamation.\r\n\r\nMore free Christian resources at:www.christiandl.com/ \r\n\r\nPlease seed.
