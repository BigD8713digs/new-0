I still feel his presence every day of my existence. The Medellin cartel&apos;s crimes weigh as heavily on my shoulders today as they did yesterday. My youth, wasted in crime, became the sword that now hangs over my graying head.\r\n\r\nTo the world, I&apos;ll always be known by my alias, Popeye, the fearsome hitman of the Medellin cartel, Pablo Escobar Gaviria&apos;s right-hand man &#x2026; How can I make you understand I&apos;m a new man &#x2026; that twenty-three years behind bars in that hellhole have transformed the person I once was.\r\n\r\nNow the freedom I yearned for is vanishing in the murderous hands of my enemies.
