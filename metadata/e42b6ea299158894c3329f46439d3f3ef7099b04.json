An economic moat - or competitive advantage - allows a company to fend off competitors and earn sustainable excess economic profits.\r\n\r\nIn The Little Book That Builds Wealth, Pat Dorsey, the head of Morningstar&apos;s equity research team, outlines an effective approach to investing that includes economic moats and tells you how to apply this strategy to your own investment endeavors.\r\n\r\nDivided into six comprehensive parts, this reliable resource guides you step by step down the path to understanding and discovering what an economic moat is, how to measure it against other moats, and how to best select a company using this method. While the moat concept is not a new one - it was made famous by Benjamin Graham and Warren Buffett - Dorsey discusses how the modern-day investor can use this strategy to select companies that possess a wide moat and feature good growth fundamentals as well as an attractive stock price.\r\n\r\nWith this book as your guide, you will discover why moats should be an integral part of your analytical investment toolkit and learn how to leverage this approach to build a portfolio of high-performance stocks.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-08-12T12:00:21.775Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:e42b6ea299158894c3329f46439d3f3ef7099b04","dn":"The Little Book That Builds Wealth_ Morningstar's Formula for Fi","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"e42b6ea299158894c3329f46439d3f3ef7099b04","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,43,110,162,153,21,136,148,195,50,159,70,67,157,63,62,247,9,155,4]},"name":"The Little Book That Builds Wealth_ Morningstar's Formula for Fi","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
