In this book, author Quint Studer, founder of Studer Group, draws on his personal experience as a former hospital executive who led two organizations to the top 1% in patient satisfaction and his experience coaching hundreds of healthcare organizations since.\r\n\r\nStuder, a nationally acclaimed educator, coach, and thought leader in healthcare today, is a master storyteller, mixing &apos;chicken soup style&apos; stories with personal insight, simple tools, and in-depth recommendations on how good organizations can become great ones.\r\n\r\nBased on Studer Group&apos;s Nine Principles SM, Quint Studer shows how to retain more employees; ensure better customer service; build strong leadership, align organizational values, goals, and results; increase communication; reward and recognize individual success while also requiring accountability; and move operational performance for better financials, market share, and growth.\r\n\r\nAt the core of the journey, he says, is a sense of purpose, worthwhile work and making a difference. When organizations learn how to harness this passion in their employees, they create a success spiral with ever increasing momentum.\r\n\r\nIn fact, Richard L. Clarke, FHFMA, President and CEO of Healthcare Financial Management Association says, &quot;Quint Studer&apos;s Nine Principles of service and operational excellence provide the missing link between people power and strong financials. It&apos;s about courageous leadership.&quot;\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-10-03T12:02:03.797Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e2dc1d8d9fa680fed95ba20d87b990179792f04","dn":"Hardwiring Excellence_ Purpose, Worthwhile Work, Making a Differ","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"4e2dc1d8d9fa680fed95ba20d87b990179792f04","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,45,193,216,217,250,104,15,237,149,186,32,216,123,153,1,121,121,47,4]},"name":"Hardwiring Excellence_ Purpose, Worthwhile Work, Making a Differ","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
