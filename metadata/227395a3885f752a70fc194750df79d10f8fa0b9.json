In exploring the psyche (and psychoses) of the likes of Richard III, Macbeth, Lear, Coriolanus, and the societies they rule over, Stephen Greenblatt illuminates the ways in which William Shakespeare delved into the lust for absolute power and the catastrophic consequences of its execution. \r\n\r\nCherished institutions seem fragile, political classes are in disarray, economic misery fuels populist anger, people knowingly accept being lied to, partisan rancor dominates, spectacular indecency rules - these aspects of a society in crisis fascinated Shakespeare and shaped some of his most memorable plays. With uncanny insight, he shone a spotlight on the infantile psychology and unquenchable narcissistic appetites of demagogues - and the cynicism and opportunism of the various enablers and hangers-on who surround them - and imagined how they might be stopped. As Greenblatt shows, Shakespeare&apos;s work, in this as in so many other ways, remains vitally relevant today.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-05-19T12:02:03.800Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:227395a3885f752a70fc194750df79d10f8fa0b9","dn":"Tyrant: Shakespeare on Politics by Stephen Greenblatt EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"227395a3885f752a70fc194750df79d10f8fa0b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,115,149,163,136,95,117,42,112,252,25,71,80,223,121,209,15,143,160,185]},"name":"Tyrant: Shakespeare on Politics by Stephen Greenblatt EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
