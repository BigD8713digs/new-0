Our 37th president&apos;s political career spanned the button-down &apos;50s, the Mad Men &apos;60s, and the turbulent &apos;70s. He faced down the Russians, the Chinese, and, ultimately, his own government. The man went from political mastermind to a national joke, sobbing in the Oval Office, leaving us with one burning question: How could he have lost it all?\r\n\r\nHere, for the first time, is the tale told in his own words: the terrifying supernatural secret he stumbled upon as a young man, the truth behind the Cold War, and the truth behind the Watergate cover-up. What if our nation&apos;s worst president was actually a pivotal figure caught in a desperate struggle between ordinary life and horrors from another reality? What if the man we call our worst president was, in truth, our greatest?\r\n\r\nIn Crooked, Nixon finally reveals the secret history of modern American politics as only Austin Grossman could reimagine it. Combining Lovecraftian suspense, international intrigue, Russian honey traps, and a presidential marriage whose secrets and battles of attrition were their own heroic saga, Grossman&apos;s novel is a masterwork of alternative history, equal parts mesmerizing character study and nail-biting Faustian thriller.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-05-15T12:00:53.706Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:15ce4c11e7159853d514fd2071c7f12c27181982","dn":"Crooked by Austin Grossman EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"15ce4c11e7159853d514fd2071c7f12c27181982","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,206,76,17,231,21,152,83,213,20,253,32,113,199,241,44,39,24,25,130]},"name":"Crooked by Austin Grossman EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
