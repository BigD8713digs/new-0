For a hundred years, loose copyright laws and a hungry reading public created a unique opportunity: Books could be published without an author&apos;s permission with extraordinary ease. Authors gained fame but suffered financially - Charles Dickens, Mark Twain, Robert Louis Stevenson, to name a few - but publishers reaped enormous profits while readers got their books on the cheap. The literary pirates who stalked the harbors, coffeehouses, and printer shops for the latest manuscript to steal were known as bookaneers.\r\n\r\nYet on the eve of the twentieth century, a new international treaty is signed to protect authors and grind this literary underground to a sharp halt. The bookaneers, of course, would become extinct. In The Last Bookaneer, Matthew Pearl gives us a historical novel set inside the lost world of these doomed outlaws and the incredible heist that brought their era to a close.\r\n\r\nOn the island of Samoa, a dying Robert Louis Stevenson labors over a new novel. The thought of one last book from the great author fires the imaginations of the bookaneers, and soon two adversaries - the gallant Pen Davenport and the monstrous Belial - set out for the south Pacific island. Pen Davenport - a tortured criminal genius haunted by his past - is reluctantly accompanied by Fergins, the narrator of our story, who has lived a quiet life of bookselling before being whisked across the world on his friend&apos;s final caper. Fergins soon discovers the supreme thrill of aiding Davenport in his quest: to steal Stevenson&apos;s manuscript and make a fortune before the new treaty ends the bookaneers&apos; trade forever.\r\n\r\nYet Samoa holds many secrets of its own, and the duo&apos;s bookish concerns clash with the island&apos;s violent destiny. A colonial war is afoot between the British, American, and German powers even as Stevenson himself quietly supports native revolutionaries from high in his mountain compound. Soon Pen and Fergins are embroiled in a conflict larger, perhaps, than literature itself. Illuminating the heroics of the bookaneers even while conjuring Stevenson himself to breathtaking life, Pearl&apos;s The Last Bookaneer is a pause-resisting journey to the dark heart of a forgotten literary era.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-06-29T12:14:33.744Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:f97c1c06cc058beb8dcbf0af2ed3c0d82bf6c5af","dn":"The Last Bookaneer: A Novel by Matthew Pearl EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"f97c1c06cc058beb8dcbf0af2ed3c0d82bf6c5af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,124,28,6,204,5,139,235,141,203,240,175,46,211,192,216,43,246,197,175]},"name":"The Last Bookaneer: A Novel by Matthew Pearl EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
