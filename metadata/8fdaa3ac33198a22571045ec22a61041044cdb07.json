I had the old &#x2018;Complete Matrix Tapes&#x2019;, &apos;The Doors: Complete&apos; [an anthology style collection but not in chronological order], and a few other single disc early 90&#x2019;s &#x2018;bootlegs.&#x2019; As I was looking at them, I said to myself, &#x201C;Shit, I could make sets as good, if not better!&#x201D; &#x2013; I also went through youtube and put together a playlist of all the Doors TV appearances to go with the artwork! I hope everyone enjoys it...\r\nAnd so do I so again thankx to buckybarnes for this collection\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Doors - Television Skies [Disc 1]\r\nDisc One: 1967-1968\r\n01 &#x2013; The End\r\n02 &#x2013; People Are Strange\r\n03 &#x2013; Light My Fire\r\n04 &#x2013; People Are Strange\r\n05 &#x2013; Moonlight Drive\r\n06 &#x2013; Light My Fire\r\n07 &#x2013; When The Music&#x2019;s Over\r\n08 &#x2013; Five To One\r\n09 &#x2013; Spanish Caravan\r\n10 &#x2013; Back Door Man/Crawling King Snake\r\n11 &#x2013; Wake Up!/Light My Fire\r\n12 &#x2013; The Unknown Soldier\r\n\r\nTrack 1: CBC Television Studios; Toronto, Canada; September 14, 1967\r\nTrack 2-3: The Ed Sullivan Show; New York, NY; September 17, 1967 \r\nTrack 4: Murray The K Show; New York, NY; September 22, 1967 \r\nTracks 5-6: The Jonathan Winters Show; Hollywood, CA; December 27, 1967\r\nTracks 7-12: The Roundhouse; London, England; September 6, 1968\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Doors - Television Skies [Disc 2]\r\nDisc Two: 1968\r\n01 &#x2013; Alabama Song/Back Door Man\r\n02 &#x2013; The Wasp (Texas Radio &amp; The Big Beat)\r\n03 &#x2013; Love Me Two Times\r\n04 &#x2013; When The Music&#x2019;s Over\r\n05 &#x2013; The Unknown Soldier\r\n06 &#x2013; Wild Child\r\n07 &#x2013; Touch Me\r\n\r\nTracks 1-5: Television-Byen; Gladsaxe, Copenhagen, Denmark; September 18, 1968\r\nTracks 6-7: Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour; CBS Television City, Los Angeles, CA; December 4, 1968\r\n\r\nThe Doors - Television Skies [Disc 3]\r\nDisc Three: 1969-1972\r\n01 &#x2013; Tell All The People\r\n02 &#x2013; Alabama Song/Back Door Man\r\n03 &#x2013; Wishful, Sinful\r\n04 &#x2013; Build Me A Woman\r\n05 &#x2013; The Soft Parade\r\n06 &#x2013; Crawling King Snake\r\n07 &#x2013; Tightrope Ride\r\n08 &#x2013; In The Eye of The Sun\r\n09 &#x2013; I&#x2019;m Horny, I&#x2019;m Stoned\r\n10 &#x2013; Love Me Two Times\r\n11 &#x2013; Verdilac\r\n12 &#x2013; Ships W/ Sails\r\n13 &#x2013; Good Rockin&#x2019;\r\n14 &#x2013; The Mosquito\r\n\r\nTracks 1-5: PBS Studios, WNET/Channel 13; New York, NY; April 28, 1969\r\nTrack 6: The Doors Workshop; Los Angeles, CA; Fall 1970\r\nTracks 7-12: Radio Bremen TV; Bremen, West Germany; May 3, 1972\r\nTracks 13-14: The Dick Cavett Show; New York, NY; August 25, 1972","last_updated":"2018-07-11T12:13:10.039Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:8fdaa3ac33198a22571045ec22a61041044cdb07","dn":"The Doors - Television Skies (3-CD) 2008 - 2018 ak256","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"8fdaa3ac33198a22571045ec22a61041044cdb07","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,218,163,172,51,25,138,34,87,16,69,236,34,166,16,65,4,76,219,7]},"name":"The Doors - Television Skies (3-CD) 2008 - 2018 ak256","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
