Now Graham is ready to tell his story: his lower-class childhood in post-war England, his early days in the British Invasion group The Hollies; becoming the lover and muse of Joni Mitchell during the halcyon years, when both produced their most introspective and important work; meeting Stephen Stills and David Crosby and reaching superstardom with Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young; and his enduring career as a solo musician and political activist. Nash has valuable insights into a world and time many think they know from the outside but few have experienced at its epicenter, and equally wonderful anecdotes about the people around him: the Beatles, the Stones, Hendrix, Cass Elliot, Dylan, and other rock luminaries.\r\n\r\nFrom London to Laurel Canyon and beyond, Wild Tales is a revealing look back at an extraordinary life - with all the highs and the lows; the love, the sex, and the jealousy; the politics; the drugs; the insanity - and the sanity - of a magical era of music.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-12-24T12:00:31.876Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:ffcb83ba1f22beec3cfd384caab12b274a53ec40","dn":"Wild Tales_ A Rock &amp; Roll Life by Graham Nash EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"ffcb83ba1f22beec3cfd384caab12b274a53ec40","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,203,131,186,31,34,190,236,60,253,56,76,170,177,43,39,74,83,236,64]},"name":"Wild Tales_ A Rock &amp; Roll Life by Graham Nash EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
