Global thinkers, politicians and artists including the Dalai Lama, Henry Kissinger and Ariel Dorfman talk about the effect of his policies and his decision making. Their thoughts are weighed equally with ordinary South Africans like Charity Kondile, who refuses to forgive her son&apos;s apartheid operative murderer.\r\nThrough these interviews, completed in the last months of Mandela&apos;s life, Matabane interrogates for himself the meaning of freedom, reconciliation and forgiveness. By doing so he challenges Mandela&apos;s enduring impact in today&apos;s world of conflict and inequality.\r\nThought-provoking and reflective, Mandela, the Myth and Me is a moving film which frames Mandela from a fresh, deeply personal perspective.\r\n\r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Container: mkv\r\n * Video Bitrate: 3922 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\n * Video Resolution: 1920x1080\r\n * Frame Rate: 25 FPS\r\n * Audio Codec: AC-3\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 192 kb/s\r\n * Audio Channels: 2\r\n * Run-Time: 1h 15 mins\r\n * Number of Parts: 1\r\n * Part Size: 2.17 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV","last_updated":"2017-12-01T12:00:29.151Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:51468b0dc4ec5d00bde49416c19114a2cb0ac229","dn":"BBC Storyville 2013 Mandela The Myth and Me 1080i docuindex HDTV","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"51468b0dc4ec5d00bde49416c19114a2cb0ac229","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,70,139,13,196,236,93,0,189,228,148,22,193,145,20,162,203,10,194,41]},"name":"BBC Storyville 2013 Mandela The Myth and Me 1080i docuindex HDTV","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
