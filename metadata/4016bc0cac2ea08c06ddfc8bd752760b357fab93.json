Metric have never been shy about shifting their sound, and each time they do their core strengths never fade. Emily Haines&apos; powerful voice and evocative lyrics, their rock-solid rhythm section, and their ability to craft immediately hooky modern rock; these things are out in full force on Art of Doubt. This time, the guitar playing of James Shaw makes the leap to a starring role. He&apos;s been great at playing a supporting role on their last few albums, but here his slashing guitar lines, rippling fills, and atmospheric pedal work give the songs a sometime gritty, sometime spacy edge that harks back to the 2005 album Live It Out. To match his energy and fiery playing, the whole band sounds energized in a way it certainly wasn&apos;t on Pagans in Vegas","last_updated":"2018-10-07T12:43:55.627Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:4016bc0cac2ea08c06ddfc8bd752760b357fab93","dn":"Metric - Art of Doubt (2018) [24.96 FLAC] vinyl","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"4016bc0cac2ea08c06ddfc8bd752760b357fab93","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,22,188,12,172,46,160,140,6,221,252,139,215,82,118,11,53,127,171,147]},"name":"Metric - Art of Doubt (2018) [24.96 FLAC] vinyl","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
