From the time she was two and &#x201C;aced out in her nudes&#x201D; to explore the neighborhood (as her mom famously described her toddler jailbreak), Busy has always been headstrong, defiant, and determined not to miss out on all the fun. These qualities led her to leave Scottsdale, Arizona, at the age of nineteen to pursue her passion for acting in Hollywood. But much like her painful and painfully funny teenage years, chasing her dreams wasn&#x2019;t always easy and sometimes hurt more than a little. \r\n\r\nIn this stunningly candid memoir, Busy opens up about chafing against a sexist system rife with on-set bullying and body shaming, being there when friends face shattering loss, enduring devastating personal and professional betrayals from those she loved best, and struggling with postpartum anxiety and the challenges of motherhood.\r\n\r\nGenre: Non-Fiction &gt; Biographies &amp; Memoirs","last_updated":"2018-10-16T12:01:24.830Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:f3f4b3f7f183fff85fe8a827f51c3dc0d796a663","dn":"This Will Only Hurt a Little by Busy Philipps (.epub)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"f3f4b3f7f183fff85fe8a827f51c3dc0d796a663","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,244,179,247,241,131,255,248,95,232,168,39,245,28,61,192,215,150,166,99]},"name":"This Will Only Hurt a Little by Busy Philipps (.epub)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
