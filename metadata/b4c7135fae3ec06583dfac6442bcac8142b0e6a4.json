Jack is an anti-patent scientist turned drug pirate, traversing the world in a submarine as a pharmaceutical Robin Hood, fabricating cheap scrips for poor people who can&apos;t otherwise afford them. But her latest drug hack has left a trail of lethal overdoses as people become addicted to their work, doing repetitive tasks until they become unsafe or insane.\r\n\r\nHot on her trail, an unlikely pair: Eliasz, a brooding military agent, and his robotic partner, Paladin. As they race to stop information about the sinister origins of Jack&apos;s drug from getting out, they begin to form an uncommonly close bond that neither of them fully understand.\r\n\r\nAnd underlying it all is one fundamental question: Is freedom possible in a culture where everything, even people, can be owned?\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-09-20T12:05:07.511Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:b4c7135fae3ec06583dfac6442bcac8142b0e6a4","dn":"Autonomous_ A Novel by Annalee Newitz ePUB eBOOK-ZAK","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"b4c7135fae3ec06583dfac6442bcac8142b0e6a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,199,19,95,174,62,192,101,131,223,172,100,66,188,172,129,66,176,230,164]},"name":"Autonomous_ A Novel by Annalee Newitz ePUB eBOOK-ZAK","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
