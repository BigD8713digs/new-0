If you majored in the humanities or social sciences, you were a fuzzy. If you majored in the computer sciences, you were a techie. This informal division has quietly found its way into a default assumption that has misled the business world for decades: that it&apos;s the techies who drive innovation.\r\n\r\nBut in this brilliantly contrarian book, Hartley reveals the counterintuitive reality of business today: it&apos;s actually the fuzzies - not the techies - who are playing the key roles in developing the most creative and successful new business ideas. They are often the ones who understand the life issues that need solving and offer the best approaches for doing so. It is they who are bringing context to code, and ethics to algorithms. They also bring the management and communication skills, the soft skills that are so vital to spurring growth.\r\n\r\nHartley looks inside some of today&apos;s most dynamic new companies, reveals breakthrough fuzzy-techie collaborations, and explores how such collaborations are at the center of innovation in business, education, and government, and why liberal arts are still relevant in our techie world.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-09-21T12:03:45.733Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb2ca2d57060c596a74c10464c0bb1567a552961","dn":"The Fuzzy and the Techie_ Why the Liberal Arts Will Rule the Dig","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"cb2ca2d57060c596a74c10464c0bb1567a552961","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,44,162,213,112,96,197,150,167,76,16,70,76,11,177,86,122,85,41,97]},"name":"The Fuzzy and the Techie_ Why the Liberal Arts Will Rule the Dig","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
