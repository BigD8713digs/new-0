From 17th-century accounts of the dances performed by African slaves on American soil to celebrated 19th-century dance-offs and contests between Irish and African-American dancers, through to the troubled Hollywood heyday of tap in the 1930s and 40s when black dancers were routinely excluded from the film roles their talent deserved.\r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC High L3.1\r\n * Video Bitrate: CRF 20 (~2080Kbps)\r\n * Video Resolution: 1280x720\r\n * Frame Rate: 25 FPS\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC-LC\r\n * Audio Bitrate: Q=0.49 VBR 48KHz (~128Kbps)\r\n * Audio Channels: 2\r\n * Run-Time: 79 mins\r\n * Part Size: 1.23 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Subtitles: Merged","last_updated":"2018-05-19T12:06:58.961Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3fbb8f291471805b4f7ac3e6da6b9c694e89c22","dn":"BBC Tap America How a Nation Found Its Feet 720p x264 AAC HDTV M","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"e3fbb8f291471805b4f7ac3e6da6b9c694e89c22","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,251,184,242,145,71,24,5,180,247,172,62,109,166,185,198,148,232,156,34]},"name":"BBC Tap America How a Nation Found Its Feet 720p x264 AAC HDTV M","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
