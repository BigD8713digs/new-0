Brandt et al. (BH, 2017).pdf\r\n\r\nTwort&apos;s Water Supply, Seventh Edition, has been expanded to provide the latest tools and techniques to meet engineering challenges over dwindling natural resources. Approximately 1.1 billion people in rural and peri-urban communities of developing countries do not have access to safe drinking water. The mortality from diarrhea-related diseases amounts to 2.2 million people each year from the consumption of unsafe water.\r\n\r\nThis update reflects the latest WHO, European, UK, and US standards, including the European Water Framework Directive. The book also includes an expansion of waste and sludge disposal, including energy and sustainability, and new chapters on intakes, chemical storage, handling, and sampling. Written for both professionals and students, this book is essential reading for anyone working in water engineering.\r\n\r\nFeatures expanded coverage of waste and sludge disposal to include energy use and sustainability\r\nIncludes a new chapter on intakes\r\nIncludes a new chapter on chemical storage and handling","last_updated":"2017-06-11T12:04:55.632Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:18b8a8cc6e79d5c62d8adae86eb505e39ecef35c","dn":"Twort&rsquo;s Water Supply 7th ed - Malcolm J.
