Based on thirty years of extensive work in industry and teaching, this book provides an overview of the sensors and sensor systems required and applied in mechatronics with an emphasis on understanding the physical principles and possible configurations of sensors rather than simply a discussion of particular types of sensors","last_updated":"2018-11-25T12:15:25.295Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:bce360f97b74846b7d4d11e9d09a60c3a0978fd2","dn":"Sensors for Mechatronics - 1st Edition","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"bce360f97b74846b7d4d11e9d09a60c3a0978fd2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,227,96,249,123,116,132,107,125,77,17,233,208,154,96,195,160,151,143,210]},"name":"Sensors for Mechatronics - 1st Edition","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
