During this period, General Dwight David Eisenhower, as Supreme Allied Commander, took control of all American, British, and Canadian air units and employed them for tactical and operational purposes over France rather than as a strategic force to attack targets deep in Germany. Using bombers as his long-range artillery, he directed the destruction of bridges, rail centers, ports, military installations, and even French towns with the intent of preventing German reinforcements from interfering with Operation Neptune, the Allied landings on the Normandy beaches. Ultimately, this air offensive resulted in the death of over 60,000 French civilians and an immense amount of damage to towns, churches, buildings, and works of art. This intense bombing operation, conducted against a friendly occupied state, resulted in a swath of physical and human destruction across northwest France that is rarely discussed as part of the D-Day landings.\r\n\r\nGenre: Non-Fiction &gt; History","last_updated":"2018-09-15T12:17:45.978Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:f7b5b1cd5a7d94e72f99721958c26196d32c773f","dn":"Beyond the Beach by Stephen Alan Bourque (.epub)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"f7b5b1cd5a7d94e72f99721958c26196d32c773f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,181,177,205,90,125,148,231,47,153,114,25,88,194,97,150,211,44,119,63]},"name":"Beyond the Beach by Stephen Alan Bourque (.epub)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
