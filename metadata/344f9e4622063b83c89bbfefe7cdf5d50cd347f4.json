A few more won&apos;t make any difference.\r\n\r\n\r\nRead by: Luke Daniels\r\n\r\nFormat : Stereo mp3\r\n\r\nBitrate: 128kbps/44.1mhz","last_updated":"2018-01-06T12:04:02.204Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:344f9e4622063b83c89bbfefe7cdf5d50cd347f4","dn":"The Wanted - Robert Crais","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"344f9e4622063b83c89bbfefe7cdf5d50cd347f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,79,158,70,34,6,59,131,200,155,191,239,231,205,245,213,12,211,71,244]},"name":"The Wanted - Robert Crais","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
