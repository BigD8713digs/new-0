His collaborations with The Smiths&apos; Johnny Marr created Electronic, the first true post-punk supergroup. \r\n\r\nBut Sumner&apos;s past, even his real name, has always remained a mystery. . . until now. In a work of rare investigative depth, Nolan re-writes the history of one of music&apos;s most influential figures, and in the process nullifies many myths, with exhaustive primary source research, dozens of exclusive interviews and scores of previously unseen photos. The definitive work on the subject","last_updated":"2017-06-12T12:07:41.958Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:102cf8b48e69338e333fdf33983b5fa932fb5279","dn":"David Nolan - Bernard Sumner - Confusion epub","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"102cf8b48e69338e333fdf33983b5fa932fb5279","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,44,248,180,142,105,51,142,51,63,223,51,152,59,95,169,50,251,82,121]},"name":"David Nolan - Bernard Sumner - Confusion epub","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
