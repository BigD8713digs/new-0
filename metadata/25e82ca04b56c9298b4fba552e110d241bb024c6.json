Rumi transforms the seemingly mundane events of daily life into profound Sufi teaching moments. These prose gems open the mystical portal to the world of the ancient mystic.\r\nThese stories include well-known and popular tales such as &quot;Angel of Death,&quot; &quot;The Sufi and His Cheating Wife,&quot; &quot;Moses and the Shepherd,&quot; &quot;Chickpeas,&quot; and &quot;The Greek and Chinese Painters&quot; as well as the less commonly quoted parables: &quot;The Basket Weaver,&quot; &quot;The Mud Eater,&quot; and &quot;A Sackful of Pebbles.&quot;\r\nRumi&apos;s voice alternates between playful and authoritative, whether he is telling stories of ordinary lives or inviting the discerning reader to higher levels of introspection and attainment of transcendent values. Mafi&apos;s translations delicately reflect the nuances of Rumi&apos;s poetry while retaining the positive tone of all of Rumi&apos;s writings, as well as the sense of suspense and drama that mark the essence of the Masnavi.\r\n\r\nAbout the Author\r\nRumi (Jalal ad-Din Muhammad Balkhi) was a 13th-century Persian Sunni Muslim poet, jurist, Islamic scholar, theologian, and Sufi mystic.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\nForeword\r\nIntroduction\r\nMasnavi I\r\nMasnavi II\r\nMasnavi HI\r\nMasnavi IV\r\nMasnavi V\r\nMasnavi VI\r\nBibliography\r\n <a href=\"\nhttps://i.postimg.cc/SxMLynFJ/1.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://i.postimg.cc/SxMLynFJ/1.jpg</a> <a href=\"\nhttps://i.postimg.cc/vBQ5LX1V/2.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://i.postimg.cc/vBQ5LX1V/2.jpg</a>","last_updated":"2018-11-02T12:23:14.970Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:25e82ca04b56c9298b4fba552e110d241bb024c6","dn":"The Book of Rumi - 105 Stories and Fables (gnv64)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"25e82ca04b56c9298b4fba552e110d241bb024c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,232,44,160,75,86,201,41,139,79,186,85,46,17,13,36,27,176,36,198]},"name":"The Book of Rumi - 105 Stories and Fables (gnv64)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
