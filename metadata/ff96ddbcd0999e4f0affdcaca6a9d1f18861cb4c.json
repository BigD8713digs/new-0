The challenge in today&apos;s world is the explosion of data from existing legacy data and incoming new structured and unstructured data. The complexity of discovering, understanding, performing analysis, and predicting outcomes on the data using machine learning algorithms is a challenge. This cookbook will help solve everyday challenges you face as a data scientist. The application of various data science techniques and on multiple data sets based on real-world challenges you face will help you appreciate a variety of techniques used in various situations.\r\n\r\nKey Features\r\nImplement a wide range of algorithms and techniques for tackling complex data\r\nImprove predictions and recommendations to have better levels of accuracy\r\nOptimize performance of your machine-learning systems\r\n\r\nThe first half of the book provides recipes on fairly complex machine-learning systems, where you&apos;ll learn to explore new areas of applications of machine learning and improve its efficiency. That includes recipes on classifications, neural networks, unsupervised and supervised learning, deep learning, reinforcement learning, and more.\r\n\r\nThe second half of the book focuses on three different machine learning case studies, all based on real-world data, and offers solutions and solves specific machine-learning issues in each one.\r\n\r\nWhat You Will Learn\r\nGet equipped with a deeper understanding of how to apply machine-learning techniques\r\nImplement each of the advanced machine-learning techniques\r\nSolve real-life problems that are encountered in order to make your applications produce improved results\r\nGain hands-on experience in problem solving for your machine-learning systems\r\nUnderstand the methods of collecting data, preparing data for usage, training the model, evaluating the model&apos;s performance, and improving the model&apos;s performance","last_updated":"2017-09-24T12:03:27.788Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff96ddbcd0999e4f0affdcaca6a9d1f18861cb4c","dn":"Practical Machine Learning Cookbook(2017) - True PDF - zeke23","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"ff96ddbcd0999e4f0affdcaca6a9d1f18861cb4c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,150,221,188,208,153,158,79,10,255,220,172,166,169,209,241,136,97,203,76]},"name":"Practical Machine Learning Cookbook(2017) - True PDF - zeke23","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
