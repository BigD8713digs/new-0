Plant knows it would be pointless to re-create the roar of Led Zeppelin. His voice isn&#x2019;t what it used to be, and he&#x2019;s adamantly refused to cash in on a reunion tour with his old band, preferring to explore new avenues with a variety of musicians over the last three decades.\r\nMany Plant fans would love for him to play a straight set of by-the-book Zeppelin covers, but the singer had other ideas -- such as working with a band that includes a member of British trip-hop maestros Massive Attack and Portishead (John Baggott) and a West African vocalist and multi-instrumentalist (Juldeh Camara).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTracklist Disk 1\r\n01.

DJ Talk.mp3\r\n\r\nBaggott, Camara and the rest of the Sensational Space Shifters put a futuristic spin on Plant&#x2019;s love of deep blues and country. The sextet&apos;s time-shifting arrangements suited Plant&#x2019;s weathered but still supple voice; he doesn&#x2019;t nail the high notes like he used to, nor does he try. He&#x2019;s more about playing with subtler shades of tone and phrasing, dancing with the syncopated rhythms and plunging into the drone to excavate melodies.\r\nAnd its working out just fine for him.\r\nThankx to Greg Kot for the review","last_updated":"2018-04-29T12:00:38.456Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:9374d45f8eea8b24bd2a3ab393e949833f6ce589","dn":"Robert Plant  The Spaceshifters - Taste Of Chicago (2-CD)2013","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"9374d45f8eea8b24bd2a3ab393e949833f6ce589","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,116,212,95,142,234,139,36,189,42,58,179,147,233,73,131,63,108,229,137]},"name":"Robert Plant  The Spaceshifters - Taste Of Chicago (2-CD)2013","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
