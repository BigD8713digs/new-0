The region, particularly Gujarat and Bombay, is well-established in the Indian imaginary and in scholarship as a mercantile hub. These essays move beyond this identity to examine the region as a dynamic place of learning and a host of knowledge, tracing the flow of knowledge, aesthetic sensibilities, values, memories and genetic programs. Contributors traverse the fields of history, anthropology, agriculture, botany, medicine, sociology and more to offer path-breaking perspectives on Western India&apos;s deep socio-cultural impact across the centuries. Western India emerges as a pivotal region in the maritime world as a transmitter of knowledge.\r\n <a href=\"\nhttps://www.palgrave.com/gp/book/9783319968384\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://www.palgrave.com/gp/book/9783319968384</a>","last_updated":"2018-09-21T12:01:37.415Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e2050b61b1fc07b6f4b086c706bd48e614ad62c","dn":"Knowledge and the Indian Ocean: Intangible Networks of Western I","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"8e2050b61b1fc07b6f4b086c706bd48e614ad62c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,32,80,182,27,31,192,123,111,75,8,108,112,107,212,142,97,74,214,44]},"name":"Knowledge and the Indian Ocean: Intangible Networks of Western I","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
