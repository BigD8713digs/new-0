What if it was something so marvelous that it transformed time and space forever?\r\n\r\nThe Body in the Clouds tells the story of one such extraordinary moment - a man falling from the sky and surviving - and of the three men who see it, in different ways and at different times, as they stand on the same piece of land. An astronomer in the 1700s, a bridge worker in the 1930s, and an expatriate banker returning home in the early 21st century: All three are transformed by this one magical event. And all three are struggling to understand what the meaning of &quot;home&quot; is and how to recognize it once you&apos;re there.\r\n\r\nWidely praised for her &quot;poetic gifts&quot; (Booklist) and &quot;graceful, supremely honest, [and] thought-provoking&quot; (Kirkus Reviews) prose, Ashley Hay has crafted a luminous and unforgettable novel about the power of story, its ability to define the world around us, and the questions that transcend time.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-07-31T12:01:27.072Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:acaebb45ce323a17197021058d7957ac53beeff8","dn":"The Body in the Clouds_ A Novel by Ashley Hay ePUB eBOOK-ZAK","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"acaebb45ce323a17197021058d7957ac53beeff8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,174,187,69,206,50,58,23,25,112,33,5,141,121,87,172,83,190,239,248]},"name":"The Body in the Clouds_ A Novel by Ashley Hay ePUB eBOOK-ZAK","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
