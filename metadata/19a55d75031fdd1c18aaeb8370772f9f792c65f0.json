Leaving not even a footprint in the snow.\r\nTwo years later, alone and more or less permanently drunk, Anders returns to Domar&#xF6; to confront his despair. He slowly realises that Maja&apos;s disappearance is not the first inexplicable tragedy to strike the islanders. Nor is everyone telling him all they know; even his own mother, it seems, is keeping secrets.\r\nAnd what is it about the sea? There&apos;s something very bad happening on Domar&#xF6;. Something that involves the sea itself.\r\nAs he did with Let the Right One In and Handling the Undead, John Ajvide Lindqvist serves up a masterful cocktail of suspense laced with bizarre humour and a narrative that barely pauses for breath. Harbour is also a heartbreaking study of loss and guilt and a novel whose epic climax pits the infinite force of nature against the implacable love of a father for his child","last_updated":"2018-07-07T12:01:45.948Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:19a55d75031fdd1c18aaeb8370772f9f792c65f0","dn":"Harbour - John Ajvide Lindqvist Epub","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"19a55d75031fdd1c18aaeb8370772f9f792c65f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,165,93,117,3,31,221,28,24,170,235,131,112,119,47,159,121,44,101,240]},"name":"Harbour - John Ajvide Lindqvist Epub","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
