But it&#x2019;s intriguing nonetheless; no one else I can think of organises their resources in quite this way, eschewing pulse and consonance, but still holding to clear parallel lines and calculated punctuations. This is a highly intended music. Its palette deliberately narrow: three saxophones, piano/percussion and contrabass/harp with guests Adam Bohman (bowed objects) and Caroline Kraabel Baritone sax) each on one track and the compositions are unyielding; but there is considerable variety nonetheless, and every sound is made to count (there are some echoes of Tim Hodgkinson&#x2019;s Western Culture aesthetic on one or two tracks, but that&#x2019;s as close to familiar as this record gets). In other words highly individual, generically indeterminate (though closest to contemporary composition) and engaged in some proper experimentation, undeviated by a wish to be loved. - Chris Cutler, ReR Megacorp","last_updated":"2017-08-12T12:00:58.165Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:c356278816109bcb6044623b5ba7749ef6e8edc5","dn":"The Remote Viewers 2011 Nerve Cure","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"c356278816109bcb6044623b5ba7749ef6e8edc5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,86,39,136,22,16,155,203,96,68,98,59,91,167,116,158,246,232,237,197]},"name":"The Remote Viewers 2011 Nerve Cure","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
