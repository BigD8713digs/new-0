Battling for the crown are Olympic gold medallist Becky Adlington, pop star Rachel Stevens, actor Tyger Drew-Honey, performer and radio presenter Debbie McGee and Radio 1 DJ Dev Griffin. \r\n\r\nThe first challenge is the Mystery Box, and the celebrities must use the given ingredients, including beef mince, pasta dough, ricotta cheese and pears, as well as a basic larder, to create one dish. \r\n\r\nThe celebrities are then split into two groups to take on the challenge of cooking in a restaurant kitchen, preparing dishes for paying customers. Becky, Tyger and Rachel are sent to M, a grill restaurant in the City of London, while Debbie and Dev are sent to Italian restaurant Margot in Covent Garden. \r\n\r\nIn the third and final test, the contestants are asked to prepare a two-course menu of their own design in just one hour. At the end of this test, one of the celebrities is sent home.\r\n\r\n(with soft subtitles) \r\n\r\nFirst broadcast: 23 August 2017\r\nDuration:  1 hour","last_updated":"2017-08-24T12:01:53.255Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c3ce96727fad78b7c5911dfe204b7aa27d7b02b","dn":"Celebrity MasterChef 2017 E03 (720p HD, soft Eng subs)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"4c3ce96727fad78b7c5911dfe204b7aa27d7b02b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,60,233,103,39,250,215,139,124,89,17,223,226,4,183,170,39,215,176,43]},"name":"Celebrity MasterChef 2017 E03 (720p HD, soft Eng subs)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
