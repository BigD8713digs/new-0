Here is the definitive guide to the theory and applications of AMLCDs.\r\n\r\nContemporary portable communication and computing devices need high image quality, light weight, thin, and low power flat panel displays. The answer to this need is the color active matrix liquid crystal display (AMLCD). The rides of AMLCD technology over less than two decades to undisputed dominance as a flat panel display has been breathtaking, and designers of portable devices need a thorough understanding of the theory and applications of AMLCDs. Willem den Boer, a holder of over 30 patents in imaging technologies, has created this guide to AMLCD theory, operating principles, addressing methods, driver circuits, application circuits, and alternate flat display technologies (including active matrix flat panel image sensors). Numerous design and applications examples illustrate key points and make them relevant to real-world engineering tasks","last_updated":"2017-06-15T12:06:36.855Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:79a59657a2923676e912afaef1eae380c4391ea1","dn":"Active Matrix Liquid Crystal Displays - Fundamentals and Applica","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"79a59657a2923676e912afaef1eae380c4391ea1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,165,150,87,162,146,54,118,233,18,175,174,241,234,227,128,196,57,30,161]},"name":"Active Matrix Liquid Crystal Displays - Fundamentals and Applica","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
