Against the backdrop of the story of one modern-day family growing up in a rambling old arts and crafts house with a gorgeous acre of lush, mature gardens, this loving memoir is filled with gardening wisdom, humor, and nostalgia for growing up in the 1960s and &#x2019;70s; it is also loaded with distinctive foodie tips and recipes that will inspire you to try them, whether you are a gardener or not. You&#x2019;ll also experience a garden in each month of the calendar and encounter a lively and readable guide to being a better and more engaged gardener by understanding the rich interior life of this beautiful discipline and craft. \r\n\r\nThe Garden Interior is more than the story of a family and gardening, though. It is about persistence, hope, letting go, and saying goodbye?to our gardens, to our homes, and to our children. It is about letting the things and people we love fulfill their own destinies and be what they must be. It is about navigating love and loss and change by surrendering the self and practicing humble acceptance. The Garden Interior is for anyone who has had these life experiences, whether sad or joyful. Its powerful final pages will move you and change you","last_updated":"2018-01-28T12:03:36.970Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:44afd664c94b37e00d839582aecbf64a54d12540","dn":"The Garden Interior - A Year of Inspired Beauty by David Jensen","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"44afd664c94b37e00d839582aecbf64a54d12540","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,175,214,100,201,75,55,224,13,131,149,130,174,203,246,74,84,209,37,64]},"name":"The Garden Interior - A Year of Inspired Beauty by David Jensen","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
