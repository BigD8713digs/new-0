Dixon, N. Toman, R. DeLisi EPUB\r\n\r\nFrom the author of the acclaimed Wall Street Journal best seller, The Challenger Sale\r\n\r\nConventional wisdom holds that to increase loyalty, companies must &quot;delight&quot; customers by exceeding service expectations. Some focus on dazzling them at the cost of neglecting to solve basic service problems - a big strategic mistake. Through extensive research and surveys, the authors have concluded that loyalty has much more to do with how well a company delivers on its basic promises than on how dazzling its service experience might be.\r\n\r\nThe authors prove that delighting customers doesn&#x2019;t build loyalty, and they show how acting on this insight can help improve service, reduce costs, and decrease customer churn. By employing practical tactics - such as teaching reps not just to resolve customer issues but also to &quot;forward resolve&quot; common issues - companies will be better able to focus on delivering a nearly effortless experience. That will lead directly to the improvements in customer loyalty they had been aiming for all along.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-06-03T12:00:53.943Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e698dabde200de5f4727d7501583a242fd8a004","dn":"The Effortless Experience by M.
