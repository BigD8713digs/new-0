War and secrets. Betrayal and redemption.\r\n\r\nNew York Times best-selling author Susan Wiggs returns with a deeply emotional and atmospheric story that spans oceans and decades, from the present-day Delaware shore to the battlefields of WWII France.\r\n\r\nWidowed by an unspeakable tragedy, Camille Palmer has made her peace with the past and settled into the quiet safety of life with her teenage daughter, Julie, in a sleepy coastal town. Then the arrival of a mysterious package breaks open the door to her family&apos;s secret past. In uncovering a hidden history, Camille has no idea that she&apos;s embarking on an adventure that will utterly transform her.\r\n\r\nCamille, Julie, and Camille&apos;s father return to the French town of his youth, sparking unexpected memories - recollections that will lead them back to the dark days of the Second World War. And it is in the stunning Proven&#xE7;al countryside that they will uncover their family&apos;s surprising history.\r\n\r\nWhile Provence offers answers about the past, it also holds the key to Camille&apos;s future. Along the way she meets a former naval officer who stirs a passion deep within her - a feeling that she thought she&apos;d never experience again.\r\n\r\nNow this hugely popular author has created her biggest, most powerful story yet - a beautiful and heartfelt novel that celebrates the bonds of family and pays homage to the sacrifices of the past.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-08-31T12:00:39.754Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:7fef912566d72e84695a70cbd442e33a80cce2e7","dn":"Map of the Heart_ A Novel by Susan Wiggs ePUB eBOOK-ZAK","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"7fef912566d72e84695a70cbd442e33a80cce2e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,239,145,37,102,215,46,132,105,90,112,203,212,66,227,58,128,204,226,231]},"name":"Map of the Heart_ A Novel by Susan Wiggs ePUB eBOOK-ZAK","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
