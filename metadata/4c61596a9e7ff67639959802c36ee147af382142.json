Two sorcerors, one a petty lordling from Barbadior, the other the king of Ygrath, have come to the Peninsula from overseas, intent on conquest. Brandin, King of Ygrath, wants to carve out a realm for his beloved younger son, Stevan. Having conquered three of the nine provinces of the Palm, he sends Stevan to subjugate the next province whilst he faces Alberico, the other conqueror. Stevan is killed in battle by the people of that last province. Brandin, in bitterest grief, and in revenge against the people who killed his son, lays a curse on that province. Tigana is a story of the struggle for identity and freedom in the face of brutal oppression.\r\n\r\nAuthor: Guy Gavriel Kay\r\nTitle: Tigana\r\nFormat: epub, html, lit, lrf\r\nLanguage: English\r\nISBN-10: 0451450280\r\nISBN-13: 9780451450289\r\n\r\nThanks to the original releaser!","last_updated":"2018-06-04T12:08:14.324Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c61596a9e7ff67639959802c36ee147af382142","dn":"Guy Gavriel Kay - Tigana","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"4c61596a9e7ff67639959802c36ee147af382142","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,97,89,106,158,127,246,118,57,149,152,2,195,110,225,71,175,56,33,66]},"name":"Guy Gavriel Kay - Tigana","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
