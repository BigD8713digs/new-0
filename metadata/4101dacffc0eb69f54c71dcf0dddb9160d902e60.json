By examining radiocarbon (C-14) dating&#x2022;the best known of these methods&#x2022;and several other techniques that geologists use to decode the distant past, Macdougall unwraps the last century&apos;s advances, explaining how they reveal the age of our fossil ancestors such as &quot;Lucy,&quot; the timing of the dinosaurs&apos; extinction, and the precise ages of tiny mineral grains that date from the beginning of the earth&apos;s history. In lively and accessible prose, he describes how the science of geochronology has developed and flourished. Relating these advances through the stories of the scientists themselves&#x2022;James Hutton, William Smith, Arthur Holmes, Ernest Rutherford, Willard Libby, and Clair Patterson&#x2022;Macdougall shows how they used ingenuity and inspiration to construct one of modern science&apos;s most significant accomplishments: a timescale for the earth&apos;s evolution and human prehistory","last_updated":"2018-08-15T21:19:53.830Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:4101dacffc0eb69f54c71dcf0dddb9160d902e60","dn":"Natures Clocks - How Scientists Measure the Age","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"4101dacffc0eb69f54c71dcf0dddb9160d902e60","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,1,218,207,252,14,182,159,84,199,29,207,13,221,185,22,13,144,46,96]},"name":"Natures Clocks - How Scientists Measure the Age","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
