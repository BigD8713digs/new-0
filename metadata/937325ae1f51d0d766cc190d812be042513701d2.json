But in 1972 her mother disappeared, setting in motion a chain of events which would forever shatter her seemingly loving family. The young girls would later learn that she had been murdered by their own father. Traumatised and confused, Muna and her sisters were taken abroad under the guise of a holiday, unaware of the horrors that lay ahead. Betrayed by the one person left to protect them, the sisters were unwittingly sold as child brides by their father. Suffering 17 years of horrific abuse at the hands of her father and others, Muna watched helplessly as, one by one, those she loved the most were torn from her, in the most tragic of circumstances. &#x2028; A Father&apos;s Betrayal is the unbelievable true story of Muna&apos;s desperate battle for survival, on a devastating journey which claimed the lives of her mother and sister, and changed her own life forever.\r\n\r\nPlease seed.
