Dick EPUB\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen catastrophic overpopulation threatens Earth, one company offers to teleport citizens to Whale&#x2019;s Mouth, an allegedly pristine new home for happy and industrious &#xE9;migr&#xE9;s. But there is one problem: the teleportation machine works in only one direction. When Rachmael ben Applebaum discovers that some of the footage of happy settlers may have been faked, he sets out on an 18-year journey to see if anyone wants to come back.\r\n\r\nLies, Inc. is one of Philip K. Dick&#x2019;s final novels, which he expanded from his novella The Unteleported Man shortly before his death. In its examination of totalitarianism, reality, and hallucination, it encompasses everything that Dick&#x2019;s fans love about his oeuvre.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-12-10T12:04:58.316Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:d62980330383fb38b74594823c1b6d5d911d1ff7","dn":"Lies, Inc. by Philip K.
