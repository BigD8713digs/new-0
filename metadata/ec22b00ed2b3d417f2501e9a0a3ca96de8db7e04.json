During a time when American nuns are under attack from the very institution to which they pledge, these sisters offer inspiring, provocative counter-stories that are sure to spark debate.\r\n\r\nOverthrowing our popular perception of nuns as killjoy schoolmarms content to live in the annals of nostalgia, Piazza defines them instead as the most vigorous catalysts of change in an otherwise constricting patriarchy.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-09-17T12:24:58.758Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec22b00ed2b3d417f2501e9a0a3ca96de8db7e04","dn":"If Nuns Ruled the World by Jo Piazza EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"ec22b00ed2b3d417f2501e9a0a3ca96de8db7e04","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,34,176,14,210,179,212,23,242,80,30,154,10,60,169,109,232,219,126,4]},"name":"If Nuns Ruled the World by Jo Piazza EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
