In the audience is a district court justice, Avishai Lazar, whom Dov knew as a boy, along with a few others who remember Dov as an awkward, scrawny kid who walked on his hands to confound the neighborhood bullies. Gradually, as it teeters between hilarity and hysteria, Dov&#x2019;s patter becomes a kind of memoir, taking us back into the terrors of his childhood: we meet his beautiful flower of a mother, a Holocaust survivor in need of constant monitoring, and his punishing father, a striver who had little understanding of his creative son. Finally, recalling his week at a military camp for youth&#x2014;where Lazar witnessed what would become the central event of Dov&#x2019;s childhood&#x2014;Dov describes the indescribable while Lazar wrestles with his own part in the comedian&#x2019;s story of loss and survival. Continuing his investigations into how people confront life&#x2019;s capricious battering, and how art may blossom from it, Grossman delivers a stunning performance in this memorable one-night engagement (jokes in questionable taste included).\r\n\r\nISBN-10: 0451493974\r\nISBN-13: 978-0451493972","last_updated":"2017-06-15T12:02:57.220Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e7bbfbab1331e012ec8ef8efbad9c303d657c9e","dn":"A Horse Walks Into a Bar by David Grossman (Man Booker 2017)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"6e7bbfbab1331e012ec8ef8efbad9c303d657c9e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,123,191,186,177,51,30,1,46,200,239,142,251,173,156,48,61,101,124,158]},"name":"A Horse Walks Into a Bar by David Grossman (Man Booker 2017)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
