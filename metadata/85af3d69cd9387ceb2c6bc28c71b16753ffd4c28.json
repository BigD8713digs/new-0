It is rather an examination into the question of the Book&#x2019;s authenticity as an historical document. It looks into the question of the Book&#x2019;s early writing, and into its integrity and truthfulness as an historical record. Of particular consideration will be the many microscopic details which will tell us either way if the Book of Judges is authentic or not. These corroborative details are the ones that the critics seem to miss all the time. They will happily disparage Judges, just as they do the rest of the Bible, with baseless allegations of late composition, error, misinformation, propaganda, or just plain fraud, whilst referring to each other for their evidence and authority. But they will not even attempt to deal with the finer evidences that shout the Book&#x2019;s authenticity. That&#x2019;s where this present study comes in.\r\n\r\nPlease seed.
