A Swing Touch 9:10\r\n\r\nSonny Fortune: alto-sax, flute\r\nMulgrew Miller: piano\r\nSanti DeBriano: bass\r\nBilly Hart: drums\r\n\r\n...This set is full of contentious moments between Fortune and Miller, and that&apos;s why it works -- because neither man is out to cut the other. They are both looking for ways to move the music into new combinatory spaces, some that include opposition in their very lyrical frames, without stepping so far outside the box the original composition becomes something other than it is. Given the depth and precision of the rhythm section behind them, this comes off almost always without a hitch. This is one tough, swinging, and emotionally strident session. It&apos;s a real winner. - Thom Jurek, AMG","last_updated":"2017-07-15T12:02:04.442Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:699d6b8af22ea18ebc95d65dcae2e5b87c21bb78","dn":"Sonny Fortune Quartet 1992 It Ain't What It Was","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"699d6b8af22ea18ebc95d65dcae2e5b87c21bb78","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,157,107,138,242,46,161,142,188,149,214,93,202,226,229,184,124,33,187,120]},"name":"Sonny Fortune Quartet 1992 It Ain't What It Was","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
