Crowned at twenty-five, she was already a wife and mother as she began her journey towards becoming a queen.\r\nAs Britain lifted itself out of the shadow of war, the new monarch faced her own challenges. Her mother doubted her marriage; her uncle-in-exile derided her abilities; her husband resented the sacrifice of his career and family name; and her rebellious sister embarked on a love affair that threatened the centuries-old links between the Church and the Crown. This is the story of how Elizabeth II drew on every ounce of resolve to ensure that the Crown always came out on top.\r\nWritten by the show&#x2019;s historical consultant, royal biographer Robert Lacey, and filled with beautifully reproduced archival photos and show stills, The Crown: The Official Companion: Volume 1 adds expert and in-depth detail to the events of the series, painting an intimate portrait of life inside Buckingham Palace and 10 Downing Street. Here is Elizabeth II as we&#x2019;ve never seen her before.\r\n\r\nAbout the Author <a href=\"\nhttps://s1.postimg.org/8fwzmhx6yn/Robert_Lacey.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://s1.postimg.org/8fwzmhx6yn/Robert_Lacey.jpg</a>\r\nRobert Lacey is the historical consultant to The Crown, having worked previously with Peter Morgan on his Oscar-winning movie The Queen.
