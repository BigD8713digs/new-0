From Baudelaire to Burroughs, Confessions of an English Opium Eater paved the way for later generations of writers. Initially prescribed as pain relief for a chronic condition, De Quincey soon found himself compelled by the opium experience. His dreams are recounted here in every hallucinatory detail: threatening Roman armies, sunken cities, and German mountaintops. De Quincey&apos;s vivid memories will evoke wonder and curiosity in the reader.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-04-20T12:42:41.668Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:84ddbaa4bb363daa0293c96d44d3b834595121b0","dn":"Confessions of an English Opium-Eater by Thomas De Quincey EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"84ddbaa4bb363daa0293c96d44d3b834595121b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,221,186,164,187,54,61,170,2,147,201,109,68,211,184,52,89,81,33,176]},"name":"Confessions of an English Opium-Eater by Thomas De Quincey EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
