Vibrant yet guarded, she keeps her secrets beyond Aila&apos;s reach. When Juliet dies, Aila and her younger brother, Miles, are sent to live in Sterling, a rural town with mysteries of its own. In Sterling, the experiences that weave life together - scents of flowers and food, reflections from mirrors and lakes, even the ability to dream - vanish every seven years. No one knows what causes these Disappearances or what will slip away next. But it has always been suspected that Juliet was somehow responsible, so Aila, bearing the brunt of that blame, follows the chain of literary clues her mother left behind. As the next Disappearance nears, Aila begins to unravel the dual mystery of why the Disappearances happen and who her mother truly was. One thing is clear: Sterling isn&apos;t going to hold on to anyone&apos;s secrets for long.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-07-20T12:00:52.017Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:f604e83dd1b07bea51e0505839fbb6197f3e6d94","dn":"The Disappearances by Emily Bain Murphy ePUB eBOOK-ZAK","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"f604e83dd1b07bea51e0505839fbb6197f3e6d94","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,4,232,61,209,176,123,234,81,224,80,88,57,251,182,25,127,62,109,148]},"name":"The Disappearances by Emily Bain Murphy ePUB eBOOK-ZAK","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
