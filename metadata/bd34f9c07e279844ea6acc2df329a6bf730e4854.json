Sears EPUB\r\n\r\nThe Civil War battle waged on September 17, 1862, at Antietam Creek, Maryland, was one of the bloodiest in the nation&apos;s history: On this single day, the battle claimed nearly 23,000 casualties. In Landscape Turned Red, the renowned historian Stephen Sears draws on a remarkable cache of diaries, dispatches, and letters to recreate the vivid drama of Antietam as experienced not only by its leaders but also by its soldiers, both Union and Confederate. Combining brilliant military analysis with narrative history of enormous power, Landscape Turned Red is the definitive work on this climactic and bitter struggle.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-06-16T12:11:42.556Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd34f9c07e279844ea6acc2df329a6bf730e4854","dn":"Landscape Turned Red by Stephen W.
