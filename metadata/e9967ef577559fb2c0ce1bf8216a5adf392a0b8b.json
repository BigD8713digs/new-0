The book collects Hickey&apos;s best and most important writing about female artists from the past twenty years. But this is far more than a compilation: Hickey has revised each essay, bringing them up to date and drawing out common themes. Written in Hickey&apos;s trademark style-accessible, witty, and powerfully illuminating-25 Women analyzes the work of Joan Mitchell, Bridget Riley, Fiona Rae, Lynda Benglis, Karen Carson, and many others. Hickey discusses their work as work, bringing politics and gender into the discussion only where it seems warranted by the art itself. The resulting book is not only a deep engagement with some of the most influential and innovative contemporary artists, but also a reflection on the life and role of the critic: the decisions, judgments, politics, and ethics that critics negotiate throughout their careers in the art world.\r\n\r\nAbout the Author\r\nDave Hickey is former executive editor of Art in America and the author of The Invisible Dragon: Essays on Beauty and Air Guitar. He has served as a contributing editor for the Village Voice and as the arts editor of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\nA Ladies&#x2019; Man: Introduction\r\nAlexis Smith My Pal Alex\r\nJoan Mitchell Epigrammat\r\nLynda Benglis Fire on the Water\r\nVija Celmins The Path Itself\r\nPia Fries The Remains of Today\r\nFiona Banner The Beauty of Our Weapons\r\nSarah Charlesworth Embracing the Beast\r\nMary Heilmann Surfing on Acid\r\nJennifer Steinkamp Breathing in the World\r\nMichelle Fierro Beauty Marks\r\nBridget Riley Not Knowing\r\nBridget Riley II For Americans\r\nElizabeth Murray Dancing in the Dark\r\nKaren Carson Sophisticate\r\nAnn Hamilton Thinking Things Through\r\nVanessa Beecroft Painted Ladies\r\nRoni Horn She Resembles Herself\r\nFiona Rae Good after the Good Is Gone\r\nBarbara Bloom Barbara Blooms\r\nSharon Ellis Modest Ecstasy\r\nHung Liu The Polity of Immigrants\r\nTeresita Fern&#xE1;ndez Tropical Scholarship\r\nNancy Rubins The Rapture and the Tsunami\r\nElizabeth Peyton At the Prince&#x2019;s Chateau\r\n <a href=\"\nhttps://s14.postimg.org/4o2nsb26p/25_Women_-_Essays_on_Their_Art.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://s14.postimg.org/4o2nsb26p/25_Women_-_Essays_on_Their_Art.jpg</a>","last_updated":"2018-01-03T12:03:18.975Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:e9967ef577559fb2c0ce1bf8216a5adf392a0b8b","dn":"25 Women - Essays on Their Art (gnv64)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"e9967ef577559fb2c0ce1bf8216a5adf392a0b8b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,150,126,245,119,85,159,178,192,206,27,248,33,106,90,223,57,42,11,139]},"name":"25 Women - Essays on Their Art (gnv64)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
