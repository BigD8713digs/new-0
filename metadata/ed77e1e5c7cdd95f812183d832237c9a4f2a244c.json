Scott Poole\r\n\r\nRequirements: .ePUB reader\r\n\r\nOverview: Historian and Bram Stoker Award nominee W. Scott Poole traces the confluence of history, technology, and art that gave us modern horror films and literature \r\n\r\nIn the early twentieth century, World War I was the most devastating event humanity had yet experienced. New machines of war left tens of millions killed or wounded in the most grotesque \r\nof ways. The Great War remade the world&#x2019;s map, created new global powers, and brought forth some of the biggest problems still facing us today. But it also birthed a new art form: the horror \r\nfilm, made from the fears of a generation ruined by war. \r\n\r\nGenre: Non-Fiction &gt; History","last_updated":"2018-10-17T12:32:26.562Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed77e1e5c7cdd95f812183d832237c9a4f2a244c","dn":"Wasteland by W.
