To that end it includes several open source tools such as parted, gparted, partclone, clonezilla, ddrescue, and secure delete, among others.\r\n\r\n\r\nMD5SUM:\r\n\r\n8002d436cde35ad6698d959d966af6bd *pmagic_2017_09_05.iso\r\n880a5639531c90f96f0aaff260f7c2ac *pmagic_pxe_2017_09_05.tar.gz\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE: For those incapable of figuring out why my releases are larger than those by other people: It is because I release the complete Parted Magic package, including the PXE files. Like it says on the PM website, if you don&apos;t know what PXE is, then you don&apos;t need the PXE file.\r\n\r\n\r\nParted Magic pmagic_2017_09_05 News\r\n\r\nThis version of Parted Magic updates GParted, Clonezilla, Linux kernel and adds a few programs.\r\n\r\nGParted has been upgraded to version 0.29.0.\r\n\r\nClonezilla has been updated to version 3.27.13, partclone to 0.2.91, and drbl to 2.25.6. The installation in Parted Magic has been tested by Steven Shiau.\r\n\r\nThe Linux kernel has been updated to 4.12.9 and firmware as of 2017/08/28.\r\n\r\nOther updates: openvpn-2.3.17, nvme-cli-1.3, flashplayer-plugin-26.0.0.137, samba-4.4.15, mozilla-firefox-52.3.0esr, libtirpc-1.0.2, libgcrypt-1.7.8, gnupg-1.4.22, gd-2.2.4, e2fsprogs-1.43.5, curl-7.55.0, ca-certificates-20161130, btrfs-progs-v4.12, bind-9.10.5_P3, gsmartcontrol-1.0.2, zfs-on-linux-0.7.0, spl-solaris-0.7.0.\r\n\r\nAdded programs: iproute2-4.4.0, iotop-0.6, ioping-0.9, fio-2.20, atop-2.2.\r\n\r\nSee the changelog for a complete list of updated programs.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHANGE LOG:\r\n <a href=\"\nhttps://partedmagic.com/changelog/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://partedmagic.com/changelog/</a>\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE:\r\n\r\nPatrick Verner has decided to take this project commercial without any provision for non-profit or low-income individuals. While I applaud his recent creation of a student version, $49 per year is almost twice what some commercial partition/disk utilities go for. While it is true that Parted Magic offers more functionality, it is all via the work of others and without support, while the commercial offerings come with support.\r\n\t\t\r\nIn order to insure access to this excellent product for low-income individuals and non-profits, I am dedicating myself to purchasing this software and insuring it is available to these users. In this spirit, please, if you can afford this software, then purchase it","last_updated":"2017-09-23T12:13:32.188Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:7aa6db05aff2577fa6690e99b95cc4b42ee38b9f","dn":"Parted Magic 2017-09-05 (pmagic_2017_09_05)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"7aa6db05aff2577fa6690e99b95cc4b42ee38b9f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,166,219,5,175,242,87,127,166,105,14,153,185,92,196,180,46,227,139,159]},"name":"Parted Magic 2017-09-05 (pmagic_2017_09_05)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
