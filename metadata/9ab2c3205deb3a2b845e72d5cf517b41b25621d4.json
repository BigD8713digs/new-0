With her signature incendiary edge and self-deprecation, Whitney comes clean about what has shaped her into the trailblazing comic that she is today. She recounts her struggles with codependence, love addiction, workaholism, eating disorders, and vagina steaming. This intimate, no-holds-barred look at Whitney&apos;s mistakes and subsequent life lessons makes for juicy schadenfreude, no doubt. However, it&apos;s also an astute, poignant, and, most importantly, honest tale of what it means to live in today&apos;s world and Twittersphere, with all the insecurities and anxieties that come with that territory. That said, at end of the day, no matter her situation, she&apos;s fine. And other lies.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-10-03T12:02:11.539Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ab2c3205deb3a2b845e72d5cf517b41b25621d4","dn":"I'm Fine... and Other Lies by Whitney Cummings ePUB eBOOK-ZAK","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"9ab2c3205deb3a2b845e72d5cf517b41b25621d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,178,195,32,93,235,58,43,132,94,114,213,207,81,123,65,178,86,33,212]},"name":"I'm Fine... and Other Lies by Whitney Cummings ePUB eBOOK-ZAK","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
