Washoku&apos;s predecessor was &apos;national people&apos;s cuisine&apos;, an attempt during the Second World War to create a uniform diet for all citizens. Japan&apos;s Cuisines reveals the diversity of Japanese cuisine and explains how Japan&apos;s modern food culture arose through the direction of private and public institutions. Readers will discover how tea came to be portrayed as the origin of Japanese cuisine, how lunch became a gourmet meal and how regions on Japan&apos;s periphery are reasserting their distinct food cultures. This is a fascinating book that reveals how the cuisine from the land of the rising sun shapes national, local and personal identity","last_updated":"2017-07-11T12:01:26.703Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:9008f19a888be90485e5ee231cd2b5c0d08c8a39","dn":"Japan's Cuisines Food, Place and Identity(2016) - MOBI - zeke23","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"9008f19a888be90485e5ee231cd2b5c0d08c8a39","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,8,241,154,136,139,233,4,133,229,238,35,28,210,181,192,208,140,138,57]},"name":"Japan's Cuisines Food, Place and Identity(2016) - MOBI - zeke23","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
