For example, it is widely known that Hitler did not get into art school, however this series reveals his failure was due to a lack of courage, having hardly prepared for the entrance exam. This attribute, one of little courage, is drawn upon time and time again: Hitler twice threatened to kill himself, firstly due to the failed Beer Hall Putsch in 1923 and secondly, after the discovery of Hitler&#x92;s involvement with his half-niece Geli Raubal, the newspapers accused him of sexual perversion. Another example adding to Hitler&#x92;s cowardice, was a picture used to show him on the front lines of the putsch in a white coat, while all others were in black. It was in fact a fake and created as part of the Hitler Myth &#x96; in reality, he was said to be cowering behind a bodyguard who was killed in the failed uprising.\r\n\r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Container: mkv\r\n * Video Bitrate: 8646 kb/s\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\n * Video Resolution: 1920x1080\r\n * Frame Rate: 50 FPS\r\n * Audio Codec: AC-3\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 384 kb/s\r\n * Audio Channels: 2\r\n * Run-Time: 59 mins\r\n * Number of Parts: 2\r\n * Part Size: 2.90 GB /part\r\n * Source: HDTV","last_updated":"2017-12-02T12:01:20.982Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef1d3e14722cee8d44f921c96ec9dc0d4d44820e","dn":"Channel 4 Hitler's Rise The Colour Films 1of2 2013 1080i docuind","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"ef1d3e14722cee8d44f921c96ec9dc0d4d44820e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,29,62,20,114,44,238,141,68,249,33,201,110,201,220,13,77,68,130,14]},"name":"Channel 4 Hitler's Rise The Colour Films 1of2 2013 1080i docuind","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
