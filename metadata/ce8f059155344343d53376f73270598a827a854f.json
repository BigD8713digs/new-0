The farm&apos;s owner, Barnabas Kane, can only look on as his friend dies and all 43 of his cattle are destroyed in the blaze.\r\n\r\nFollowing the disaster, the bull-headed and proudly self-sufficient Barnabas is forced to reach out to the community for assistance. But resentment simmers over the farmhand&apos;s death, and Barnabas and his family begin to believe their efforts at recovery are being sabotaged.\r\n\r\nBarnabas is determined to hold firm. Yet his teenage son struggles under the weight of a terrible secret, and his wife is suffocated by the uncertainty surrounding their future. As Barnabas fights ever harder for what is rightfully his, his loved ones are drawn ever closer to a fate that should never have been theirs.\r\n\r\nIn The Black Snow, Paul Lynch takes the pastoral novel and - with the calmest of hands - tears it apart. With beautiful, haunting prose, Lynch illuminates what it means to live through crisis and puts to the test our deepest certainties about humankind.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-04-01T12:02:21.396Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce8f059155344343d53376f73270598a827a854f","dn":"The Black Snow by Paunch EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"ce8f059155344343d53376f73270598a827a854f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,143,5,145,85,52,67,67,213,51,118,247,50,112,89,138,130,122,133,79]},"name":"The Black Snow by Paunch EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
