The reasons for this unique reality lie in its past and the particular historical circumstances of its birth. \r\n\r\nThis book seeks to update analysis of the political history, contemporary politics, economics and foreign policy of this unique state. The first part of the book provides a general history of Israel since its inception until 2000. This general history evolves around the political development of the state, beginning with its origins in the early Zionist history (1882-1948) and ending with the turn of the century. The second part focuses on three contemporary aspects of present-day Israel: its political economy, its culture and its international relations. An epilogue describes Israel&apos;s complex international image today and its impact on the state and its future.\r\n\r\nGenre: Non-Fiction &gt; General","last_updated":"2018-09-14T12:25:31.128Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:8dc543204aacb6ea5ddbfc34ea603208c7043c76","dn":"Israel by Ilan Pappe (.epub)(.azw3)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"8dc543204aacb6ea5ddbfc34ea603208c7043c76","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,197,67,32,74,172,182,234,93,219,252,52,234,96,50,8,199,4,60,118]},"name":"Israel by Ilan Pappe (.epub)(.azw3)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
