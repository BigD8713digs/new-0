It traces the roots of the hippies back to a 19th-century German sect of wandering naturalists called Lebensreform who brought their freethinking ideas about nature to California after the Second World War. There they merged with a growing interest in Eastern mystical concepts of human nature imported to America by maverick British thinkers like Aleister Crowley and Aldous Huxley. Add to this mix a wonder drug first developed by the CIA called LSD and a wave of student activists and anti-war protestors agitating for revolution and you have the astonishing story how these forces came together to give birth to the Summer of Love in San Francisco, 1967.\r\n\r\n(with soft subtitles) \r\n\r\nFirst broadcast: 9 June 2017\r\nDuration:  1 hour","last_updated":"2017-06-11T12:05:19.787Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:1dce8c8fd121e57e2df4c3ceea6b181a6e400108","dn":"Horizon 2017 Strange Signals from Ou (widescreen)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"1dce8c8fd121e57e2df4c3ceea6b181a6e400108","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,206,140,143,209,33,229,126,45,244,195,206,234,107,24,26,110,64,1,8]},"name":"Horizon 2017 Strange Signals from Ou (widescreen)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
