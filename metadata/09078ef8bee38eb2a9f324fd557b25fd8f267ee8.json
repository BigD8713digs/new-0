Amen EPUB\r\n\r\nA proven program from number one New York Times best-selling author and brain researcher Dr. Daniel Amen to help you change your brain and improve your memory today!\r\n\r\nBrain imaging research demonstrates that memory loss actually starts in the brain decades before you have any symptoms. Learn the actions you can take to help not just prevent memory loss later in life...but to begin restoring the memory you may have already lost.\r\n\r\nExpert physician Dr. Amen reveals how a multipronged strategy - including dietary changes, physical and mental exercises, and spiritual practices - can improve your brain health, enhance your memory, and reduce the likelihood that you&apos;ll develop Alzheimer&apos;s and other memory loss-related conditions.\r\n\r\nKeeping your brain healthy isn&apos;t just a medical issue; it&apos;s a God-given capacity and an essential building block for physical, emotional, and spiritual health. Take action against the fast-increasing memory crisis that threatens this crucial part of who you are - and help your brain, body, and soul stay strong for the rest of your life.\r\n\r\nAuthor bio: Dr. Daniel G.
