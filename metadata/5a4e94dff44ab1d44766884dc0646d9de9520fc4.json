In this documentary, writer and historian Michael Collins delivers a riposte to the urban intelligentsia which has spent a century sneering at the suburbs. His south London pilgrimage takes him to Bexley and Bromley, Surbiton and the new promised land of Bluewater in Kent to explore what the suburban garden has meant to us and to celebrate what one contributor calls &apos;their little piece of heaven&apos;.\r\n\r\nScreenshot:\r\n <a href=\"\nhttps://extraimage.net/images/2017/09/15/fc44235f94daa532a679a1e430d90d22.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://extraimage.net/images/2017/09/15/fc44235f94daa532a679a1e430d90d22.jpg</a>","last_updated":"2017-09-16T12:13:06.963Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a4e94dff44ab1d44766884dc0646d9de9520fc4","dn":"Everyday Eden A Potted History of the Suburban Garden 720p-SOIL","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"5a4e94dff44ab1d44766884dc0646d9de9520fc4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,78,148,223,244,74,177,212,71,102,136,77,192,100,109,157,233,82,15,196]},"name":"Everyday Eden A Potted History of the Suburban Garden 720p-SOIL","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
