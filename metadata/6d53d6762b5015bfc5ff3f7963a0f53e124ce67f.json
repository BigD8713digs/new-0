It could be argued that little has changed. Gender Lessons takes an in-depth look at how schools institutionalize gender-how kids are taught the rules and expectations of performing masculinity and femininity. This work provides extensive examples of how elementary, middle, and high schools: sextype; defend and preserve patriarchy; weave gendered expectations in all things school related; promote inequity; and limit their students&apos; potential by explicitly and implicitly teaching that they must fit into only one of two boxes...&quot;girl&quot; or &quot;boy.&quot; Richardson argues that schools-a powerful and wide reaching publicly funded mechanism-should be engaged in social (re)imagination that disbands the antiquated girl/boy and feminine/masculine binary so that kids might have a chance at being themselves. This book is sure to provoke conversation in courses and professional communities interested in education, gender studies, social work, sociology, counseling and guidance","last_updated":"2018-02-02T12:05:06.167Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d53d6762b5015bfc5ff3f7963a0f53e124ce67f","dn":"Gender Lessons - Patriarchy, Sextyping And Schools (Teaching Gen","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"6d53d6762b5015bfc5ff3f7963a0f53e124ce67f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,83,214,118,43,80,21,191,197,255,63,121,99,160,245,62,18,76,230,127]},"name":"Gender Lessons - Patriarchy, Sextyping And Schools (Teaching Gen","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
