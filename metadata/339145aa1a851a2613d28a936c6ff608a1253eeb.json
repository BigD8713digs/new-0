Despite warnings such as this one, President Truman supported establishing a Jewish state on land primarily inhabited by Muslims and Christians.\r\n\r\nFew Americans today are aware that U.S. support enabled the creation of modern Israel. Even fewer know that U.S. politicians pushed this policy over the forceful objections of top diplomatic and military experts.\r\n\r\nAs this work demonstrates, these politicians were bombarded by a massive pro-Israel lobbying effort that ranged from well-funded and very public Zionist organizations to an &quot;elitist secret society&quot; whose members included Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis.\r\n\r\nAgainst Our Better Judgment brings together meticulously sourced evidence to illuminate a reality that differs starkly from the prevailing narrative. It provides a clear view of the history that is key to understanding one of the most critically important political issues of our day.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-10-23T12:01:20.732Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:339145aa1a851a2613d28a936c6ff608a1253eeb","dn":"Against Our Better Judgment by Alison Weir EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"339145aa1a851a2613d28a936c6ff608a1253eeb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,145,69,170,26,133,26,38,19,210,138,147,108,111,246,8,161,37,62,235]},"name":"Against Our Better Judgment by Alison Weir EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
