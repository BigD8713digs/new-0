Valued by her boss for her apolitical leanings, knowledge of the Middle East, language skills and creative thinking, Elizabeth drives international diplomacy, battles office politics and circumvents protocol, while negotiating national and international issues. At home, politics and compromise take on new meaning with her supportive husband and three bright kids","last_updated":"2018-11-26T12:11:53.346Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:5abb9b2cb3dc754ccf5325fd56bea9fe310c850b","dn":"Madam.Secretary.S05E08.720p.HDTV.x264.[432MB].[MP4]","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"5abb9b2cb3dc754ccf5325fd56bea9fe310c850b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,187,155,44,179,220,117,76,207,83,37,253,86,190,169,254,49,12,133,11]},"name":"Madam.Secretary.S05E08.720p.HDTV.x264.[432MB].[MP4]","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
