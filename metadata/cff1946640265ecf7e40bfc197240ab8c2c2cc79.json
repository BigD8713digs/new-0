De Jonge, Christopher L. R. Barratt \r\nCambridge  University Press | July 2017 | ISBN-10: 1107126320 | 316 Pages | PDF | 22.7 mb\r\n\r\nThis revised and updated second edition provides a comprehensive account of the human male gamete. Detailed overviews of human sperm production, maturation, and function - and how these processes affect and influence fertility, infertility, and assisted reproduction - are given. A wide range of new developments including proteomics, spermatogenesis, sperm-specific WW domain-binding proteins, Ca2+ signalling, DNA packaging, epididymis are explored, whilst a new chapter presents information gained from mouse genetics, highlighting how it informs male fertility research. The impact of environmental factors during pre-pubertal and pubertal stages of life is also investigated. Featuring engaging prose with chapters organized topographically, The Sperm Cell remains an essential resource for andrologists, clinical scientists, and laboratory personnel.\r\n\r\nAbout the Authors\r\nChristopher De Jonge is Director of the Andrology Program at the University of Minnesota Medical Center and Adjunct Professor in the Department of Urology at the University of Minnesota.\r\nChristopher L. R. Barratt is Professor of Reproductive Medicine at the School of Medicine, University of Dundee, Ninewells Hospital, Dundee.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\nList of Contributors page vii\r\nForeword by Ryuzo Yanagimachi x\r\nPreface xiii\r\n1 Spermatogenesis: Clinical and Experimental Considerations 1\r\n2 Sperm Chromatin Stability and Susceptibility to Damage in Relation to Its Structure 21\r\n3 Sperm Ultrastructure in Fertile Men and Male Sterility: Revisiting Teratozoospermia 36\r\n4 Sperm RNA and Its Use as a Clinical Marker 59\r\n5 Role of the Epididymis in Sperm Maturation 73\r\n6 Seminal Plasma Plays Important Roles in Fertility 88\r\n7 Physiological and Pathological Aspects of SpermMetabolism 109\r\n8 Regulation of Sperm Behaviour: The Role(s) of [Ca2+]i Signalling 126\r\n9 Proteomics of Capacitation 143\r\n10 Current Concepts and Unresolved Questions in Human Sperm Cumulus and Zona Interaction 152\r\n11 Sperm-SpeciicWW-Domain-Binding Proteins 157\r\n12 Fundamental Role for Sperm Phospholipase C \u0002 in Mammalian Fertilization 177\r\n13 Male Infertility and Assisted Reproduction 193\r\n14 The Genetic Basis ofMale Infertility 208\r\n15 The Sperm Epigenome 230\r\n16 Environmental Factors andMale Fertility 240\r\n17 Susceptibility of the Testis to Lifestyle and Environmental Factors During the Life Course 260\r\n18 Mouse Genetics &#x2013; How Does It Inform Male Fertility Research? 280\r\nIndex 297\r\nColour plates are to be found between pages 178 and 179.\r\n <a href=\"\nhttps://s21.postimg.org/sazhxo553/The_Sperm_Cell_-_Production_Maturation_Fertili.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://s21.postimg.org/sazhxo553/The_Sperm_Cell_-_Production_Maturation_Fertili.jpg</a>","last_updated":"2017-05-31T12:02:19.966Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:cff1946640265ecf7e40bfc197240ab8c2c2cc79","dn":"The Sperm Cell - Production, Maturation, Fertilization (gnv64)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"cff1946640265ecf7e40bfc197240ab8c2c2cc79","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,241,148,102,64,38,94,207,126,64,191,193,151,36,10,184,194,194,204,121]},"name":"The Sperm Cell - Production, Maturation, Fertilization (gnv64)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
