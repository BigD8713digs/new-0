Scientific and technological advances have opened gateways to an extraordinary future. \r\n\r\nEarth is no longer humanity&apos;s only home.\r\n\r\nNew habitats have been created throughout the solar system on moons, planets, and in between. \r\n\r\nBut in this year, 2312, a sequence of events will force humanity to confront its past, its present, and its future.\r\n\r\nThe first event takes place on Mercury, on the city of Terminator, itself a miracle of engineering on an unprecedented scale. \r\n\r\nIt is an unexpected death, but one that might have been foreseen. \r\n\r\nFor Swan Er Hong, it is an event that will change her life. \r\n\r\nSwan was once a woman who designed worlds. Now she will be led into a plot to destroy them.\r\n\r\n\r\nRead by: Sarah Zimmerman\r\n\r\nFormat: Stereo mp3\r\n\r\nBit Rate: 128Kbps/44.1Hz\r\n\r\n\r\nRemember to tip your uploader and seed! :)","last_updated":"2018-03-31T12:17:46.853Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:1baef9e07d9057a108cecf5e00166070ed4d0600","dn":"2312 - Kim Stanley Robinson","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"1baef9e07d9057a108cecf5e00166070ed4d0600","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,174,249,224,125,144,87,161,8,206,207,94,0,22,96,112,237,77,6,0]},"name":"2312 - Kim Stanley Robinson","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
