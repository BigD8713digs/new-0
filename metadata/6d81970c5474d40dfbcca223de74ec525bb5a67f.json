Gary Moore had a rare talent in that he could both shred out licks in a spitfire fashion as well as slowly squeeze them out drenched with finesse and emotion, like barely molten wax melancholically dripping away from its motherload. I can think offhand of only one other white electric guitar player who could tell a story with a single note better than Moore-and that would be Peter Green-who turns up here in the form of not only his music (Blues for Greeny is a homage to Peter Green), but also in his vintage 58 Gold Top Les Paul that was passed on to Gary Moore when Peter Green exited the music scene. \r\n\r\nBlues for Greeny takes a few of Peter Greens signature songs and reworks them. \r\n\r\nBack to the Blues is more of the same-with some blues staples (Stormy Monday) alternating with some original songs-each featuring the searing guitar licks that punctuate the vocal delivery","last_updated":"2017-11-24T12:06:43.704Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d81970c5474d40dfbcca223de74ec525bb5a67f","dn":"Gary Moore:Blues Alive, Blues for Greeny, Back to the Blues FLAC","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"6d81970c5474d40dfbcca223de74ec525bb5a67f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,129,151,12,84,116,212,13,251,204,162,35,222,116,236,82,91,181,166,127]},"name":"Gary Moore:Blues Alive, Blues for Greeny, Back to the Blues FLAC","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
