Harriet Jacobs (1813-97) was enslaved, along with her family, in North Carolina under a ruthless master who sexually harassed her. After several failed escape attempts, and several years of hiding, she finally made her way North to freedom, where she was eventually reunited with her children. The book was published in 1861.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-11-06T12:03:08.839Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:f371cadba1cbc67f61ff0fdb382816237eef78a7","dn":"Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl by Harriet Ann Jacobs EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"f371cadba1cbc67f61ff0fdb382816237eef78a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,113,202,219,161,203,198,127,97,255,15,219,56,40,22,35,126,239,120,167]},"name":"Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl by Harriet Ann Jacobs EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
