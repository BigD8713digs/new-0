A torrent of their discography has been available here on TPB for some time now, but not all of the albums in that upload are high quality mp3 files. So I took it upon myself to scour the internet for better quality material.\r\nThree of their albums (&#x2018;Greetings From Timbuk 3,&#x2019; &#x2018;Eden Alley,&#x2019; and &#x2018;Edge of Allegiance&#x2019;) I found on(many thanks to users marksman and Hudok for uploading those albums). The &#x2018;Live From Austin City Limits&#x2019; album I found on newalbumreleases.net, and &#x2018;Some of the Best of Timbuk 3: Field Guide&#x2019; I took from the above-mentioned discography torrent. The rest of the albums were ripped by me personally.\r\nIt didn&#x2019;t require hours and hours of exertion, but I did put some effort into compiling this torrent, so I hope the people that download it really enjoy it. And I know this will mostly fall on deaf ears since the majority of people are selfish and greedy, but please seed. You would never complete a download if no one seeded, so be considerate and return the favor","last_updated":"2017-07-29T12:02:18.693Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ed06fc2f7d35f32d0d2ae6a174f46fef59e4845","dn":"Timbuk 3 - Discography (1986-2011)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"7ed06fc2f7d35f32d0d2ae6a174f46fef59e4845","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,208,111,194,247,211,95,50,208,210,174,106,23,79,70,254,245,158,72,69]},"name":"Timbuk 3 - Discography (1986-2011)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
