Whereas previous accounts have emphasised the growth of state-run armies during this period, David Parrott argues instead that the delegation of military responsibility to sophisticated and extensive networks of private enterprise reached unprecedented levels. This included not only the hiring of troops but their equipping, the supply of food and munitions, and the financing of their operations.\r\n\r\nThe book reveals the extraordinary prevalence and capability of private networks of commanders, suppliers, merchants and financiers who managed the conduct of war on land and at sea, challenging the traditional assumption that reliance on mercenaries and the private sector results in corrupt and inefficient military force. In so doing, the book provides essential historical context to contemporary debates about the role of the private sector in warfare.\r\n\r\nPaperback: 448 pages\r\nPublisher: Cambridge University Press; 1st edition (April 9, 2012)","last_updated":"2017-07-27T12:00:33.323Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:cbfd9e330221fdb7ec51bf30dd7c5ec89e37394b","dn":"The Business of War: Military Enterprise and Revolution in...","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"cbfd9e330221fdb7ec51bf30dd7c5ec89e37394b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,253,158,51,2,33,253,183,236,81,191,48,221,124,94,200,158,55,57,75]},"name":"The Business of War: Military Enterprise and Revolution in...","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
