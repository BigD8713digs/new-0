All life vanished from the sea. In despair, an oyster farmer named Shigeatsu Hatakeyama decided to rebuild his life. Though a fisherman, he also spent decades reforesting the surrounding hills and was sure the sea would recover. This program starts following Hatakeyama just after the disaster, showing how the sea and the forest are cleansed through mutual interaction. Featuring his moving monologue, it celebrates the miracle of resurrected life in a seaside village.\r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC High L3.1\r\n * Video Bitrate: CRF 20 (~2849Kbps)\r\n * Video Resolution: 1280x720\r\n * Frame Rate: 25 FPS\r\n * Audio Codec: HE-AAC\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 64Kbps CBR 24KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: 2 (Japanese)\r\n * Run-Time: 49 mins\r\n * Part Size: 1.01 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Subtitles: Embedded English","last_updated":"2018-03-31T12:02:13.039Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:d22dc7c2425c486296d01712201dbbccf15a3f83","dn":"NHK The Fisherman and the Forest 720p x264 AAC HDTV ","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"d22dc7c2425c486296d01712201dbbccf15a3f83","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,45,199,194,66,92,72,98,150,208,23,18,32,29,187,204,241,90,63,131]},"name":"NHK The Fisherman and the Forest 720p x264 AAC HDTV ","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
