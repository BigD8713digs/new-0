For too long we&apos;ve inured ourselves to the wild intelligence of our muscled flesh, taking our primary truths from technologies that hold the living world at a distance. This book subverts that distance, drawing readers ever deeper into their animal senses in order to explore, from within, the elemental kinship between the body and the breathing Earth.\r\n\r\nThe shapeshifting of ravens, the erotic nature of gravity, the eloquence of thunder, the pleasures of being edible: all have their place in Abram&apos;s investigation. He shows that from the awakened perspective of the human animal, awareness (or mind) is not an exclusive possession of our species but a lucid quality of the biosphere itself - a quality in which we, along with the oaks and the spiders, steadily participate.\r\n\r\nWith the audacity of its vision and the luminosity of its prose, Becoming Animal sets a new benchmark for the human appraisal of our place in the whole.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-01-25T12:10:09.806Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:bfbca32999ee3883a476e1dbdd6590e0d3b3fb68","dn":"Becoming Animal_ An Earthly Cosmology by David Abram EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"bfbca32999ee3883a476e1dbdd6590e0d3b3fb68","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,188,163,41,153,238,56,131,164,118,225,219,221,101,144,224,211,179,251,104]},"name":"Becoming Animal_ An Earthly Cosmology by David Abram EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
