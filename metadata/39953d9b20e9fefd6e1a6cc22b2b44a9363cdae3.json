Today he is on a mission; a mission to ensure that the British public are made aware of the abomination that is about to be unleashed on their &apos;Green &amp; Pleasant Land&apos;.\r\n\r\nFormer oilfield executive Ian R Crane has engaged industry sources and independent researchers to lay the foundations for his investigations into fracking -- mining of shale and coal seam gas. In &quot;Fractured Future -- It doesn&apos;t have to be this way&quot;, a nationwide speaking tour, Ian asks whether this &apos;miracle&apos; of nature really will be the solution to our nation&apos;s problems? Is it going to be the best thing for us since North Sea gas, or are there hidden dangers which could impact upon communities in ways which need open discussion?\r\n\r\nPlease share this information far and wide, burn the video to DVDs/Blu-ray discs or put it on USB Flash Drives and give them out to friends, family and others.\r\n\r\nPlease seed as long as possible, at least to a ratio of 1.100, thank you :)\r\n\r\nGeneral           : FRACKtured Future - The Fracking Nightmare - Ian R Crane 1080p.mp4\r\nFormat            : MPEG-4 at 2 076 kb/s\r\nLength            : 2.41 GiB for 2 h 46 min 20 s 53 ms\r\n\r\nVideo #0          : AVC at 1 945 kb/s\r\nAspect            : 1920 x 1080 (1.778) at 25.000 fps\r\n\r\nAudio #0          : AAC at 126 kb/s\r\nInfos             : 2 channels, 44.1 kHz\r\n\r\nScreens: <a href=\"\nhttps://extraimage.net/images/2018/09/27/1757aec72b14e932ea5092e0602625c8.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://extraimage.net/images/2018/09/27/1757aec72b14e932ea5092e0602625c8.png</a> <a href=\"\nhttps://extraimage.net/images/2018/09/27/77ede0dc674d8b052b190ce7db5aec57.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://extraimage.net/images/2018/09/27/77ede0dc674d8b052b190ce7db5aec57.png</a> <a href=\"\nhttps://extraimage.net/images/2018/09/27/9e02306e1695c003b956699fb82c4dea.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://extraimage.net/images/2018/09/27/9e02306e1695c003b956699fb82c4dea.png</a> <a href=\"\nhttps://extraimage.net/images/2018/09/27/06915a790a841df403c222733efa74e2.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://extraimage.net/images/2018/09/27/06915a790a841df403c222733efa74e2.png</a> <a href=\"\nhttps://extraimage.net/images/2018/09/27/557c2555044ed07a41328e688920a72a.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://extraimage.net/images/2018/09/27/557c2555044ed07a41328e688920a72a.png</a> <a href=\"\nhttps://extraimage.net/images/2018/09/27/86596040935717ec0e854ed4c40f458a.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://extraimage.net/images/2018/09/27/86596040935717ec0e854ed4c40f458a.png</a>","last_updated":"2018-09-27T12:14:20.905Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:39953d9b20e9fefd6e1a6cc22b2b44a9363cdae3","dn":"FRACKtured Future - The Fracking Nightmare - Ian R Crane 1080p","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"39953d9b20e9fefd6e1a6cc22b2b44a9363cdae3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,149,61,155,32,233,254,253,110,26,108,194,43,43,68,169,54,60,218,227]},"name":"FRACKtured Future - The Fracking Nightmare - Ian R Crane 1080p","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
