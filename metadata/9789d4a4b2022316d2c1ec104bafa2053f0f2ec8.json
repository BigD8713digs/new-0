History teaches us that a third of Europe&apos;s population was destroyed. But what if the plague had killed 99 percent of the population instead? How would the world have changed? This is a look at the history that could have been - a history that stretches across centuries, a history that sees dynasties and nations rise and crumble, a history that spans horrible famine and magnificent innovation. These are the years of rice and salt.\r\n\r\nThis is a universe where the first ship to reach the New World travels across the Pacific Ocean from China and colonization spreads from west to east. This is a universe where the Industrial Revolution is triggered by the world&apos;s greatest scientific minds - in India. This is a universe where Buddhism and Islam are the most influential and practiced religions, and Christianity is merely a historical footnote.\r\n\r\nThrough the eyes of soldiers and kings, explorers and philosophers, slaves and scholars, Robinson renders an immensely rich tapestry. Rewriting history and probing the most profound questions as only he can, Robinson shines his extraordinary light on the place of religion, culture, power, and even love on such an Earth. From the steppes of Asia to the shores of the Western Hemisphere, from the age of Akbar to the present and beyond, here is the stunning story of the creation of a new world.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-10-06T12:03:39.712Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:9789d4a4b2022316d2c1ec104bafa2053f0f2ec8","dn":"The Years of Rice and Salt by Kim Stanley Robinson ePUB eBOOK-ZA","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"9789d4a4b2022316d2c1ec104bafa2053f0f2ec8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,137,212,164,178,2,35,22,210,193,236,16,75,175,162,5,63,15,46,200]},"name":"The Years of Rice and Salt by Kim Stanley Robinson ePUB eBOOK-ZA","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
