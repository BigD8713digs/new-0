Robb (In Death #45)\r\nEnglish | 2017 | Mystery &amp; Thriller | EPUB | 1.12 MB\r\n\r\n\r\nA new novel in the #1 New York Times bestselling series: Lt. Eve Dallas must separate rumors from reality when a woman who traffics in other people&#x2019;s secrets is silenced.\r\nThe chic Manhattan nightspot Du Vin is not the kind of place Eve Dallas would usually patronize, and it&#x2019;s not the kind of bar where a lot of blood gets spilled. But that&#x2019;s exactly what happens one cold February evening.\r\nThe mortally wounded woman is Larinda Mars, a self-described &#x201C;social information reporter,&#x201D; or as most people would call it, a professional gossip. As it turns out, she was keeping the most shocking stories quiet, for profitable use in her side business as a blackmailer. Setting her sights on rich, prominent marks, she&#x2019;d find out what they most wanted to keep hidden and then bleed them dry. Now someone&#x2019;s done the same to her, literally&#x2014;with a knife to the brachial artery.\r\nEve didn&#x2019;t like Larinda Mars. But she likes murder even less. To find justice for this victim, she&#x2019;ll have to plunge into the dirty little secrets of all the people Larinda Mars victimized herself. But along the way, she may be exposed to some information she really didn&#x2019;t want to know&#x2026;\r\n\r\nEnjoy and please SEED!!!","last_updated":"2017-09-06T12:08:39.013Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:da2fe092c6be0720926fe1573dfb3e0554a50c50","dn":"Secrets in Death - J.D.
