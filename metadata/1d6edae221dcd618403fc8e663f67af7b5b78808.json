Rivers only wants to play music and video games, and he won&#x2019;t follow any rules, according to his family. The parents say Rivers lashes out violently and verbally not only toward them, but his younger brothers as well. His Aunt Cindy wrote into the show saying she is concerned for the safety of her sister and the rest of the family. Both parents say they cannot enforce consequences on their son because of his fits of rage. They come together as a family to see how to regain control of Rivers and their lives","last_updated":"2017-11-20T12:02:08.505Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d6edae221dcd618403fc8e663f67af7b5b78808","dn":"Dr.Phil.Show.2017.10.12-CBS","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"1d6edae221dcd618403fc8e663f67af7b5b78808","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,110,218,226,33,220,214,24,64,63,200,230,99,246,122,247,181,183,136,8]},"name":"Dr.Phil.Show.2017.10.12-CBS","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
