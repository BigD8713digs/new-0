The next chapter describes the five treatment options for acidosis, including using an isotonic, alkaline, glucose, physiological sodium chloride solutions and alkalosis. Other chapters examine acidosis under physiological and pathological conditions. The concluding chapter surveys the micro- and macro-techniques, as well as Van Slyke&apos;s apparatus for bicarbonate content determination of the plasma or the serum. \r\n\r\nThis book will prove useful to clinicians, gastrologists, and general medical practitioners","last_updated":"2017-06-10T12:00:22.621Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:d66aa866c0cdd20289d0df0475dade1f9891be99","dn":"Acidosis - Clinical Aspects and Treatment with Isotonic Sodium B","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"d66aa866c0cdd20289d0df0475dade1f9891be99","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,106,168,102,192,205,210,2,137,208,223,4,117,218,222,31,152,145,190,153]},"name":"Acidosis - Clinical Aspects and Treatment with Isotonic Sodium B","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
