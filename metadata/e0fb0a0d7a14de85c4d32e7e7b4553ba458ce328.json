He&apos;s also an expert on debunking the supernatural. When he receives a letter from Boone Creek, North Carolina, about ghostly lights appearing in a cemetery, he can&apos;t resist driving down to investigate. Here, in this tightly knit community, Lexie Darnell runs the town&apos;s library. Disappointed by past relationships, she is sure of one thing: her future is in Boone Creek, close to all the people she loves. From the moment Jeremy sets eyes on Lexie, he is intrigued.
