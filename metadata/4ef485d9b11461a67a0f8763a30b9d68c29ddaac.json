This means it helps you prepare your 3D models to be displayed online. Koru lets you load 3D objects in various formats, setup the scene and apply materials, then export the result for web. Our advanced realtime 3D rendering engine guarantees that models will look the same in any WebGL-supporting browser.\r\nKoru Features:\r\n\r\nSnapshots\r\nKoru lets you take snapshots of your scene. Snapshots save various scene&apos;s aspects like objects positions, camera settings or materials. You can make different designs or scene layouts and animations, and easily switch between them with a single click.\r\n\r\nMaterials Library\r\nKoru comes with a large materials library, so you don&apos;t need to start from scratch. This includes metals, plastic, paint, glass, wood, paper and much more like hot foil or spot UV materials.\r\n\r\nLive Preview\r\nKoru makes sure that your scene looks exactly the same in any browser as in Koru itself. All the materials and other scene controls are designed for WebGL export, so you get absolutely predictable results.\r\n\r\nSimple User Interface\r\nWe believe that you are busy enough to spend time learning yet another application, so we made a great effort to hide all the complexities behind the nice and clean user interface.\r\n\r\nTools\r\nKoru comes with powerful tools that fix UV mapping or normals to make sure your scene looks as intended. The tools are easy to use and don&apos;t require special learning.\r\n\r\nFile Formats\r\nKoru reads almost any popular 2D and 3D formats. For images, Koru reads color profiles, supports CMYK images and even reads PSD, AI and PDF files. HDR images are also supported.\r\n\r\nWhat&apos;s new:\r\nofficial site does not provide any info about changes in this version","last_updated":"2018-04-29T12:11:26.685Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ef485d9b11461a67a0f8763a30b9d68c29ddaac","dn":"Appsforlife Koru [1.4.2][2018]","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"4ef485d9b11461a67a0f8763a30b9d68c29ddaac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,244,133,217,177,20,97,166,122,15,135,99,163,11,157,104,194,157,218,172]},"name":"Appsforlife Koru [1.4.2][2018]","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
