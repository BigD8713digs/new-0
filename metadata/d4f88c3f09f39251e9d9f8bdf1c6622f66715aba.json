From the theoretical discussions of nuclear energy to the bright glare of Trinity, there was a span of hardly more than 25 years. What began as merely an interesting speculative problem in physics grew into the Manhattan Project and then into the bomb with frightening rapidity, while scientists known only to their peers - Szilard, Teller, Oppenheimer, Bohr, Meitner, Fermi, Lawrence, and yon Neumann - stepped from their ivory towers into the limelight.\r\n\r\nRichard Rhodes takes us on that journey step by step, minute by minute, and gives us the definitive story of man&apos;s most awesome discovery and invention. The Making of the Atomic Bomb has been compared in its sweep and importance to William L. Shirer&apos;s The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich. It is at once a narrative tour de force and a document as powerful as its subject.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-10-25T12:03:04.909Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:d4f88c3f09f39251e9d9f8bdf1c6622f66715aba","dn":"The Making of the Atomic Bomb by Richard Rhode","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"d4f88c3f09f39251e9d9f8bdf1c6622f66715aba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,248,140,63,9,243,146,81,233,217,248,189,241,198,98,47,102,113,90,186]},"name":"The Making of the Atomic Bomb by Richard Rhode","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
