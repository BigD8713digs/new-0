In short: I loved it, right down to the utterly chilling final line.&quot; (Gillian Flynn, New York Times best-selling author of Gone Girl)\r\n\r\nThis is a love story. Mike&#x2019;s love story. \r\n\r\nMike Hayes fought his way out of a brutal childhood and into a quiet if lonely life - before he met Verity Metcalf. V taught him about love, and in return Mike has dedicated his life to making her happy. He&#x2019;s found the perfect home, the perfect job; he&#x2019;s sculpted himself into the physical ideal V has always wanted. He knows they&#x2019;ll be blissfully happy together. It doesn&#x2019;t matter that she hasn&#x2019;t been returning his emails or phone calls. It doesn&#x2019;t matter that she says she&#x2019;s marrying Angus. It&#x2019;s all just part of the secret game they used to play. If Mike watches V closely, he&#x2019;ll see the signs. If he keeps track of her every move, he&#x2019;ll know just when to come to her rescue....\r\n\r\nA spellbinding, darkly twisted book about desire and obsession and the complicated lines between truth and perception, Our Kind of Cruelty introduces Araminta Hall, a chilling new voice in psychological suspense.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-05-11T12:00:38.727Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:b6c8dc10e17593ab0fdaf606852ec04f175bef16","dn":"Our Kind of Cruelty by Araminta Hall EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"b6c8dc10e17593ab0fdaf606852ec04f175bef16","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,200,220,16,225,117,147,171,15,218,246,6,133,46,192,79,23,91,239,22]},"name":"Our Kind of Cruelty by Araminta Hall EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
