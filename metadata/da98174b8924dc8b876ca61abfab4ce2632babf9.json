While progressive, this was a controversial design decision among fans of the original title, a well-known first-person shooter built on the Doom engine. The music was composed by Kevin Schilder. Gerald Brom contributed conceptual work to characters and creatures for the game. This is the only Heretic/Hexen video game that is unrelated to id Software, apart from its role as engine licenser.\r\n\r\n- run the file &quot;Setup.exe&quot;\r\n-then run the Enhancement pack &quot;Ht2_EP_v1-06.exe&quot;","last_updated":"2018-01-08T12:07:31.116Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:da98174b8924dc8b876ca61abfab4ce2632babf9","dn":"Heretic II Full","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"da98174b8924dc8b876ca61abfab4ce2632babf9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,152,23,75,137,36,220,139,135,108,166,26,191,171,76,226,99,43,171,249]},"name":"Heretic II Full","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
