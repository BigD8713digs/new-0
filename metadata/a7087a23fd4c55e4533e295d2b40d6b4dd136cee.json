The shoegaze outfit&#x2019;s tenure abruptly ended on the very day the album was completed when its nineteen-year-old lead singer, guitarist, and main songwriter, Buster Svendsen, died from a lethal combination of alcohol and drugs on June 16, 2011, four years after the Denmark band&#x2019;s formation. As a result, only now is the material being issued publicly, in this case by Jonas Munk&#x2018;s Azure Vista Records (Munk, whose involvement with the group in a production capacity began in 2009, co-produced, mixed, and mastered the release). \r\nThough band members Svendsen, Aske Wolfhagen, Simon Skytthe, and Jeppe Nygaard were only in their teens at the time, Dorias Baracca had become something of a known quantity before the album&#x2019;s creation, with the 2010 Handsome Melting Point EP, issued on the London label Club AC30, having received fulsome critical praise from the likes of Drowned in Sound. It&#x2019;s easy to understand why: there&#x2019;s shredding aplenty in the opener &#x201C;Handsome Melting Point,&#x201D; but there&#x2019;s also swoon-worthy melodicism. Hushed verses and anthemic choruses alternate in classic pop manner, with the band&#x2019;s guitar-fueled swarm proving more soothing than grating. As much as the sound&#x2019;s rooted in shoegaze (dreampop, if you prefer), the pop dimension&#x2019;s as strong, and the quieter episodes suggest one could even conceivably trace the band&#x2019;s lineage back to The Byrds. Svendsen&#x2019;s singing has much to recommend it, his soft, satiny voice somehow managing to retain clarity despite the massive swirl of the instrumental design with which it&#x2019;s paired. \r\n \r\n\r\nTracklist: \r\n01 - Handsome Melting Point.flac \r\n02 - Dean &amp; Dane.flac \r\n03 - Fed.flac \r\n04 - Shaky Dreams (You and Me Forever).flac \r\n05 - Another Day (Without Shoes).flac \r\n06 - Goodbye.flac \r\n07 - Wake Me Up (With a Kiss).flac \r\n\r\nSummary: \r\nCountry: Denmark \r\nGenre: shoegaze","last_updated":"2018-06-17T12:04:33.845Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:a7087a23fd4c55e4533e295d2b40d6b4dd136cee","dn":"[shoegaze] (2018) Dorias Baracca - Dorias Baracca [FLAC,Tracks] ","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"a7087a23fd4c55e4533e295d2b40d6b4dd136cee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,8,122,35,253,76,85,228,83,62,41,93,43,64,214,180,221,19,108,238]},"name":"[shoegaze] (2018) Dorias Baracca - Dorias Baracca [FLAC,Tracks] ","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
