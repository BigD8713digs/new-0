While we drink millions of cups of the stuff each day, how many of us know where our tea actually comes from? The surprising answer is that most of the leaves that go into our everyday teabags do not come from India or China, but are bought from an auction in the coastal city of Mombasa in Kenya.  \r\n\r\nFrom here, Simon follows the tea trail through the epic landscapes of Kenya and Uganda and meets some of the millions of people who pick, pack and transport our tea. Drinking tea with everyone from Masai cattle herders to the descendants of the original white tea planters, Simon learns that the industry that supplies our everyday cuppa is not immune to the troubles of the continent - poverty, low wages and child labour.\r\n\r\n(with soft subtitles) \r\n\r\nFirst broadcast: 12 January 2014\r\nDuration:  1 hour","last_updated":"2017-05-27T09:01:03.210Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:8695939985ddc16b79f8d550301870f9920d5b55","dn":"This World - The Tea Trail with Simon Reeve","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"8695939985ddc16b79f8d550301870f9920d5b55","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,149,147,153,133,221,193,107,121,248,213,80,48,24,112,249,146,13,91,85]},"name":"This World - The Tea Trail with Simon Reeve","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
