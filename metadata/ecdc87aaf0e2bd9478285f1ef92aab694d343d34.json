Each woman&apos;s experience helps us see a truer, fuller, richer version of what really happened in this country during this time period.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-08-29T12:03:27.150Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:ecdc87aaf0e2bd9478285f1ef92aab694d343d34","dn":"Women of the Blue and Gray by Marianne Monson EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"ecdc87aaf0e2bd9478285f1ef92aab694d343d34","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,220,135,170,240,226,189,148,120,40,95,30,249,42,171,105,77,52,61,52]},"name":"Women of the Blue and Gray by Marianne Monson EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
