The male leads weren&apos;t even cast. The financing was shaky at best. The script had been rewritten countless times. And yet something about Wild Oats lured Shirley MacLaine to the film&apos;s location shoot in the far-off Canary Islands - and straight to the center of one of the most thrilling and paradigm-shifting adventures of her life.\r\n\r\nThe making of the film feels like a screwball comedy, as the cast and crew face unpredictable daily obstacles with ingenuity, grit, and personal sacrifice. Yet the chaos leads Shirley to a revelatory new understanding of the demise of one of history&apos;s most elusive yet endlessly intriguing places. Scholars have long theorized that Spain&apos;s Canary Islands are the remnants of the mighty lost continent of Atlantis. As the movie set descends into pandemonium, Shirley finds fascinating corollaries between the island&apos;s cataclysmic fate and our own dangerous trajectory. Can we learn the lessons the citizens of Atlantis failed to comprehend?\r\n\r\nThe answer is borne out of recovered memories from Shirley&apos;s past life on Atlantis and through a series of meditations that reveal the necessity of unfettered imagination when looking for bold new truths, rendering this evocative memoir essential for anyone seeking a broader understanding of what it means to be human - both where we came from and where we are going.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-01-26T12:03:37.756Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:bfeb699a0f4d81578c46ddfd69ff3543c40bc638","dn":"Above the Line_ My Wild Oats Adventure by Shirley MacLaine EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"bfeb699a0f4d81578c46ddfd69ff3543c40bc638","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,235,105,154,15,77,129,87,140,70,221,253,105,255,53,67,196,11,198,56]},"name":"Above the Line_ My Wild Oats Adventure by Shirley MacLaine EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
