Joining Wheeler out in front of the 18-piece orchestra is his regular pianist John Taylor and the vocalist Norma Winstone. The disc begins with the huge, half-hour-long &quot;Sweet Ruby Suite,&quot; which really cooks toward the end. It goes on to feature two shorter Wheeler compositions, &quot;Now and Now Again&quot; and &quot;W.W.&quot; (the latter from 1984&apos;s Double, Double You), as well as John Taylor&apos;s &quot;Pure and Simple,&quot; which appears a couple of times in drummer Peter Erskine&apos;s discography. Founder, arranger, and saxophonist Greg Carter directs the band with aplomb, summoning hard-driving swing. New York&apos;s John Hollenbeck is tremendously effective in the drum chair; Mike Murley, from the fusion band Metalwood, enlivens the saxophone section, stepping out with a number of fine solos. A vital addition to Wheeler&apos;s large-ensemble library, not to mention the canon of contemporary big band writing in general. - David R.
