Allen EPUB\r\n\r\nThe last thing Los Angeles needed was a high-tech, ex-assassin from another world setting up shop as a private detective. They got one anyway, in the form of Justin Case, a smart-ass killing machine looking for a little redemption. When one of Case&apos;s closest friends turns up dead, the alien detective and his predatory partner Magdelain track down an Italian mobster secretly hammering L.A. with a new designer drug. Case must call in favors from a bare-knuckles brawler tied to the Russian mob and a hot-bodied sniper who makes a mean cappuccino. Before the end, he&apos;ll even put the love of his life in harm&apos;s way and risk everything by revealing his greatest secret.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-06-16T12:12:04.534Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:541e5b7e17150db7c582c6b8e4e9b5a07835fef7","dn":"Chemical Burn by Quincy J.
