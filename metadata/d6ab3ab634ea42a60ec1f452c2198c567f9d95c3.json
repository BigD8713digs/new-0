Jomny finds friendship in a bear tired of other creatures running away in fear, an egg struggling to decide what to hatch into, an owl working its way to being wise, a tree feeling stuck in one place, a tadpole coming to terms with turning into a frog, a dying ghost, a puppy unable to express itself, and many more.\r\n\r\nThrough this story of a lost, lonely and confused alien finding friendship, acceptance, and love among the creatures of Earth, we will all learn how to be a little more human. And for all of us earth-bound creatures here on this planet, we can all be reminded that sometimes, it takes an outsider to help us see ourselves for who we truly are","last_updated":"2017-11-21T12:01:39.067Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6ab3ab634ea42a60ec1f452c2198c567f9d95c3","dn":"Jomny Sun: Everyone's a Aliebn When Ur a Aliebn Too: A Book","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"d6ab3ab634ea42a60ec1f452c2198c567f9d95c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,171,58,182,52,234,66,166,14,193,244,82,194,25,140,86,127,157,149,195]},"name":"Jomny Sun: Everyone's a Aliebn When Ur a Aliebn Too: A Book","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
