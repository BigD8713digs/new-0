The triumphant result is Heart Berries, a memorial for Mailhot&apos;s mother, a social worker and activist who had a thing for prisoners; a story of reconciliation with her father - an abusive drunk and a brilliant artist - who was murdered under mysterious circumstances; and an elegy on how difficult it is to love someone while dragging the long shadows of shame.\r\n\r\nMailhot trusts us to understand that memory isn&apos;t exact, but melded to imagination, pain, and what we can bring ourselves to accept. Her unique and at times unsettling voice graphically illustrates her mental state. As she writes, she discovers her own true voice, seizes control of her story, and, in so doing, reestablishes her connection to her family, to her people, and to her place in the world.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-02-07T12:04:52.803Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:4dac4dd634d78bd52dc34d31332bcb36a08e4e59","dn":"Heart Berries_ A Memoir by Terese Marie Mailhot AZW3","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"4dac4dd634d78bd52dc34d31332bcb36a08e4e59","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,172,77,214,52,215,139,213,45,195,77,49,51,43,203,54,160,142,78,89]},"name":"Heart Berries_ A Memoir by Terese Marie Mailhot AZW3","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
