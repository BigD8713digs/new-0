The triumphs and tragedies are told in the words of the actors themselves, humble and mighty. Mr Brook-Shepherd&apos;s original eye-witness sources range from the eighty-nine-year-old former Empress Zita of Austria-Hungary (the last surviving member of Europe&apos;s old ruling order), to private soldiers who fought on both sides of the barbed wire. \r\n\r\nIn describing the death of Old Europe and the suicide of the Empires, the author provides a far-reaching overview of the new world order that dawned in November 1918. The result is a panorama rich in colour and human interest which provides a background to the events of that year; an essential lesson for readers even today.\r\n\r\nGenre: Non-Fiction &gt; History","last_updated":"2018-09-17T12:17:00.403Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:dcadbc4b184a88b416116953bf7317cf27211473","dn":"November 1918 by Gordon Brook-Shepherd (.epub)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"dcadbc4b184a88b416116953bf7317cf27211473","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,173,188,75,24,74,136,180,22,17,105,83,191,115,23,207,39,33,20,115]},"name":"November 1918 by Gordon Brook-Shepherd (.epub)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
