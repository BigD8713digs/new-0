Alarmingly, however, religious radicalisation continues as before. Britain&apos;s establishment is pretending to be tough on terrorism, as it continues to look the other way. This refusal to act goes back three decades, when a hub for terror throughout Europe and elsewhere was allowed access to British soil - Londonistan. In Londonistan (updated with new materials including Wikileaks), Melanie Phillips interviews key politicians, moderate Muslims, academics and intelligence experts. She uncovers a persistent state of denial by the establishment entrusted with our security, both on the left and right. Hers is an acclaimed and gripping history of the failure of the way in which Britain is handling its terrorist and social crisis.\r\n\r\nPlease seed.  Thanks!","last_updated":"2017-06-05T12:02:17.115Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:5743e1c7273550020081d2b5ccbae060775315c0","dn":"Londonistan: How Britain Created a Terror State within-   Philip","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"5743e1c7273550020081d2b5ccbae060775315c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,67,225,199,39,53,80,2,0,129,210,181,204,186,224,96,119,83,21,192]},"name":"Londonistan: How Britain Created a Terror State within-   Philip","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
