In thirty-one meditations, he implores his readers with his usual pithiness to break through illusion, the great obstacle to love. &quot;Love springs from awareness,&quot; de Mello insists, saying that it is only when we see others as they are that we can begin to really love. But not only must we seek to see others with clarity, we must examine ourselves without misconception. The task, however, is not easy. &quot;The most painful act,&quot; de Mello says, &quot;is the act of seeing. But in that act of seeing that love is born.&quot; Anthony De Mello was the director of the Sadhana Institute of Pastoral Counseling in Poona, India, and authored several books. The Way To Love is his last.\r\n <a href=\"\nhttps://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/way-to-love-anthony-de-mello/1119833741\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/way-to-love-anthony-de-mello/1119833741</a>","last_updated":"2018-04-24T12:11:01.389Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:b3ab2fd72826239deb3e0bb6281476a7d48d27fc","dn":"The Way to Love: The Last Meditations of Anthony de Mello - Anth","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"b3ab2fd72826239deb3e0bb6281476a7d48d27fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,171,47,215,40,38,35,157,235,62,11,182,40,20,118,167,212,141,39,252]},"name":"The Way to Love: The Last Meditations of Anthony de Mello - Anth","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
