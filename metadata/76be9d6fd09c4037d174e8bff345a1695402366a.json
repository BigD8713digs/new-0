The day Sun was released, Marshall nearly died; eventually, she was diagnosed with an immune disorder that hindered her ability to tour in support of the album. She then discovered she was pregnant with the son she gave birth to in 2015, and creative differences with her longtime label Matador led her to release Wanderer on Domino Records. These are the kind of life-changing events that, with any luck, make a person stronger. If Wanderer is anything to go by, Marshall must be unstoppable. She packs the enormity of her experiences into songs that are fearless in their starkness, and a far cry from Sun&apos;s sleek electro-rock. This time, Marshall focuses her production and arrangements on her voice, which has become the instrument her songs have always needed. A little raspier than before and as remarkably emotive as always, it&apos;s so full of living that no flashy accompaniment is needed on songs such as the title track","last_updated":"2018-10-07T12:48:45.754Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:76be9d6fd09c4037d174e8bff345a1695402366a","dn":"Cat Power - Wanderer (2018) [24.96 FLAC] vinyl","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"76be9d6fd09c4037d174e8bff345a1695402366a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,190,157,111,208,156,64,55,209,116,232,191,243,69,161,105,84,2,54,106]},"name":"Cat Power - Wanderer (2018) [24.96 FLAC] vinyl","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
