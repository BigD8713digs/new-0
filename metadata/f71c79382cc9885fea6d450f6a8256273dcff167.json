Process Lasso monitors programs that actively load the CPU and restricts them, thereby improving the system response. It can also automatically reduce the priority for the process by applying the default values. Windows, by default, allows programs to fully boot the CPU, which leads to system hangup and, accordingly, to the inconvenience of the work. The Process Lasso ProBalance (Process Balance) technology gently redistributes the priorities of running programs, so processes that previously downloaded the entire CPU will no longer affect the response of the system","last_updated":"2017-09-04T12:04:13.251Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:f71c79382cc9885fea6d450f6a8256273dcff167","dn":"Process Lasso Pro 9.0.0.398 Final RePack (&amp; Portable)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"f71c79382cc9885fea6d450f6a8256273dcff167","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,28,121,56,44,201,136,95,234,109,69,15,106,130,86,39,61,207,241,103]},"name":"Process Lasso Pro 9.0.0.398 Final RePack (&amp; Portable)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
