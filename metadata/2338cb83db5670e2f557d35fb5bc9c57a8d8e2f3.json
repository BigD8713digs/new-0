There are a number of very popular patterns that have been tried and tested over the years. The Gang of Four (GoF) design patterns especially, have stood the test of time. This course aims at teaching you how to implement the most popular of the GoF design patterns using nothing but the Java EE standards API.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho is the target audience?\r\n    Java developers who need to implement design patterns\r\n    Java developers who want to explore the power of Java EE\r\n    Java EE developers who need to understand how to use the Java EE APIs\r\n    Java developers seeking to explore Java EE\r\n    Application developers seeking to improve application design with design patters\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n    Java 8 Development Environment\r\n    NetBeans or IntelliJ IDE\r\n    Glassfish application server\r\n    GIT SCM\r\n    Fair knowledge of the Java Programming language\r\n    A fair basic understanding of Java EE programming concepts","last_updated":"2018-05-06T12:06:11.112Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:2338cb83db5670e2f557d35fb5bc9c57a8d8e2f3","dn":"Udemy - Modern Design Patterns with Java EE 8","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"2338cb83db5670e2f557d35fb5bc9c57a8d8e2f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,56,203,131,219,86,112,226,245,87,211,95,181,188,156,87,168,216,226,243]},"name":"Udemy - Modern Design Patterns with Java EE 8","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
