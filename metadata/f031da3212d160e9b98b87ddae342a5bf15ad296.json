Enis Cetin et al. (AP, 2016).pdf\r\n\r\nThis book describes the signal, image and video processing methods and techniques for fire detection and provides a thorough and practical overview of this important subject, as a number of new methods are emerging.\r\n\r\nThis book will serve as a reference for signal processing and computer vision, focusing on fire detection and methods for volume sensors. Applications covered in this book can easily be adapted to other domains, such as multi-modal object recognition in other safety and security problems, with scientific importance for fire detection, as well as video surveillance.\r\n\r\nCoverage includes:\r\n\r\nCamera Based Techniques\r\nMulti-modal/Multi-sensor fire analysis\r\nPyro-electric Infrared Sensors for Flame Detection\r\nLarge scale fire experiments\r\nWildfire detection from moving aerial platforms\r\nThe basics of signal, image and video processing based fire detection\r\nThe latest fire detection methods and techniques using computer vision\r\nNon-conventional fire detectors: Fire detection using volumetric sensors\r\nRecent large-scale fire experiments and their results\r\nNew and emerging technologies and areas for further research","last_updated":"2017-06-08T12:03:17.886Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:f031da3212d160e9b98b87ddae342a5bf15ad296","dn":"Methods and Techniques for Fire Detection - A.
