Until it became the Post-Apocalyptic Space Age.\n\nYour space station is about to explode and you only have 60 seconds before things get messy. What (or who) will you grab before you make a mad dash for the emergency shuttle and begin your journey into THE GREAT UNKNOWN?\n\nThis is 60 Parsecs!, a dark comedy sci-fi adventure set in the Atomic Space Age - complete with all the Cold War paranoia, chrome-plated wall accents and cockroaches with space helmets.\n\nLead a crew of woefully unprepared astronauts, equipped with whatever junk - sorry - &quot;supplies&quot; you can grab before blasting off, on a journey across the cosmos that&apos;s best described as misguided. Make the best of it, while dealing with soup shortages and other horrors of outer space. Will you have what it takes to find a new home and survive?\n\nBon voyage!","last_updated":"2018-09-19T12:14:49.626Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:63153f6e909f531d3f538626bc37341d02643946","dn":"60 Parsecs!","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"63153f6e909f531d3f538626bc37341d02643946","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,21,63,110,144,159,83,29,63,83,134,38,188,55,52,29,2,100,57,70]},"name":"60 Parsecs!","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
