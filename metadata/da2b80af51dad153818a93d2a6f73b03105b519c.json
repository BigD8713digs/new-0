Robert Taylor (CRC, 2016).pdf\r\n\r\nIn contrast to nuclear plants and aerospace systems, human error is largely ignored in quantitative risk assessment for petroleum and chemical plants. Because of this, current risk analysis methods are able to calculate and predict only about one-third of the accidents happening in practice. Human Error in Process Plant Design and Operations: A Practitioner&#x2019;s Guide shows you how to develop a comprehensive risk assessment that includes human error. Based on the well-known SRK model of human error, this book represents a practical collection of examples and statistics from more than 30 years of study, with many examples of the practical application of methods.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe book provides a complete overview of the various types of human error, including operator error, hindrances and inability to function, errors in observation, errors in performing standard procedures, errors in supervisory control, errors in decision making and planning, infractions and violations, design errors, and errors in procedures. It then goes on to identify human error potential and probabilities, and discusses techniques and methodologies that can be implemented to minimize human errors and prevent accidents.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe result of the author&apos;s observations of human error over a lifetime of work as an operator, as a commissioning coordinator, and as an operations manager, the book demonstrates how to analyse, manage, and mitigate many types of error. By taking advantage of the author&apos;s experience and expert knowledge, and by applying the techniques and methodologies illustrated in this book, you will be able to make changes which will make work easier, error free, clearly understood, and more congenial","last_updated":"2017-06-07T12:05:50.566Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:da2b80af51dad153818a93d2a6f73b03105b519c","dn":"Human Error in Process Plant Design and Operations","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"da2b80af51dad153818a93d2a6f73b03105b519c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,43,128,175,81,218,209,83,129,138,147,210,166,247,59,3,16,91,81,156]},"name":"Human Error in Process Plant Design and Operations","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
