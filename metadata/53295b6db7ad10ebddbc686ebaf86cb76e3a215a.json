But Vladimir Nabokov&apos;s wise, ironic, elegant masterpiece owes its stature as one of the 20th century&apos;s novels of record not to the controversy its material aroused but to its author&apos;s use of that material to tell a love story that is shocking in its beauty and tenderness.\r\n\r\nAwe and exhilaration, along with heartbreak and mordant wit, abound in this account of the aging Humbert Humbert&apos;s obsessive, devouring, and doomed passion for the nymphet Dolores Haze. Lolita is also the story of a hypercivilized European colliding with the cheerful barbarism of postwar America. But most of all, it is a meditation on love - as outrage and hallucination, madness and transformation.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-07-22T12:00:26.385Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:53295b6db7ad10ebddbc686ebaf86cb76e3a215a","dn":"Lolita by Vladimir Nabokov epub RtR","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"53295b6db7ad10ebddbc686ebaf86cb76e3a215a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,41,91,109,183,173,16,235,221,188,104,110,186,248,108,183,110,58,33,90]},"name":"Lolita by Vladimir Nabokov epub RtR","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
