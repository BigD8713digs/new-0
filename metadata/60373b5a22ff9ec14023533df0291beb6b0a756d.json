Only a small group of young girls, the Leprechauns, can wield the ancient weapons needed to fend off invasions from these creatures. Into the girls&apos; unstable and fleeting lives, where a call to certain death could come at any moment, enters an unlikely character: a young man who lost everything in his final battle five hundred years ago, the last living human awakened from a long, icy slumber. Unable to fight any longer, Willem becomes the father that the girls never had, caring for and nurturing them even as he struggles to come to terms with his new life, in which he feels the pain of helplessly waiting for his loved ones to return home from battle that his &apos;Daughter&apos; once felt for him so long ago. Together, Willem and the girls gradually come to understand what family means and what is truly worth protecting","last_updated":"2017-11-11T12:05:26.605Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:60373b5a22ff9ec14023533df0291beb6b0a756d","dn":"WorldEnd: What do you do at the end of the world?
