Easy to understand, and convenient to use, this guide book gives concisely the information necessary to evaluate most problems which occur in concrete applications. In the newer editions emphasis was laid on those fields of mathematics that became more important for the formulation and modeling of technical and natural processes, namely Numerical Mathematics, Probability Theory and Statistics, as well as Information Processing. Besides many enhancements and new paragraphs, new sections on Geometric and Coordinate Transformations, Quaternions and Applications, and Lie Groups and Lie Algebras were added for the sixth edition.[/b]","last_updated":"2017-07-11T12:05:40.103Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:d27f14bfce547f43b5a964b588a46ea6218604f7","dn":"Handbook of mathematics everyday guide for working","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"d27f14bfce547f43b5a964b588a46ea6218604f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,127,20,191,206,84,127,67,181,169,100,181,136,164,110,166,33,134,4,247]},"name":"Handbook of mathematics everyday guide for working","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
