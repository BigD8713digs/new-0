Why do skeptical and relativistic arguments have such power in the contemporary intellectual world? Why do they have that power in the humanities but not in the sciences? Why has a significant portion of the political Left - the same Left that traditionally promoted reason, science, equality for all, and optimism - now switched to themes of anti-reason, anti-science, double standards, and cynicism? Explaining Postmodernism is intellectual history with a polemical twist, providing fresh insights into the debates underlying the furor over political correctness, multiculturalism, and the future of liberal democracy","last_updated":"2017-06-19T12:04:35.006Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:c771ace469c21328e5798043d385a69d6b39193b","dn":"Explaining Postmodernism [Unabridged] Stephen Hicks","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"c771ace469c21328e5798043d385a69d6b39193b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,113,172,228,105,194,19,40,229,121,128,67,211,133,166,157,107,57,25,59]},"name":"Explaining Postmodernism [Unabridged] Stephen Hicks","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
