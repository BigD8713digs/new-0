Govert Schilling takes listeners to sites where these stories unfolded - including Japan&apos;s KAGRA detector, Chile&apos;s Atacama Cosmology Telescope, the South Pole&apos;s BICEP detectors, and the United States&apos; LIGO labs. He explains the seeming impossibility of developing technologies sensitive enough to detect waves from two colliding black holes in the very distant universe, and describes the astounding precision of the LIGO detectors. Along the way, Schilling clarifies concepts such as general relativity, neutron stars, and the big bang using language that listeners with little scientific background can grasp","last_updated":"2018-04-01T12:04:00.376Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3609c4422be07ac17aed65dea09ebeb23697c18","dn":"Govert Schilling,&lrm; Martin Rees-Ripples in Spacetime","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"e3609c4422be07ac17aed65dea09ebeb23697c18","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,96,156,68,34,190,7,172,23,174,214,93,234,9,235,235,35,105,124,24]},"name":"Govert Schilling,&lrm; Martin Rees-Ripples in Spacetime","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
