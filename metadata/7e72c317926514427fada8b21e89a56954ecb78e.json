Popular answers are the Vatican or Catholic Church, Rome (&quot;the city on seven hills&quot;), Jerusalem and Iraq where the literal city Babylon is found. These answers may seem to adequate when you focus on only a few verses or traits of Mystery Babylon. However, when you consider all 60 characteristics of Daughter Babylon or Babylon the Great found throughout Bible prophecy, only one answer fits the many verses literally without forcing: America the Great. This article was written by the late R. A. Coombes.\r\n\r\nNote: Although I host and recommend Rick Coombes article here, it does not mean I agree with all of it. Many of the &quot;60 proofs&quot; are on the vague side and, in my opinion, forced, while others are great, high quality proofs I never heard before his book. For me quantity is less important that quality. Please disregard the lower quality proofs and focus on the detailed, specific quality proofs that only fit America (such as the mother country, deep sea water port, economy, military, etc.) to get the rare benefit of this article","last_updated":"2017-11-15T12:01:24.349Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e72c317926514427fada8b21e89a56954ecb78e","dn":"Mystery Babylon - Is it The USa","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"7e72c317926514427fada8b21e89a56954ecb78e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,114,195,23,146,101,20,66,127,173,168,178,30,137,165,105,84,236,183,142]},"name":"Mystery Babylon - Is it The USa","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
