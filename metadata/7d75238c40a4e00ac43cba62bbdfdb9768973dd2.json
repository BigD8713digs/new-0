Following the departure of founding guitarist Erin Elders, the remaining trio of Shiraz Dada, David Davison, and Christopher Hainey forged ahead with the spirit of a new band, taking big steps beyond the persistent math rock designation into fresh territory that incorporated more rhythm and upbeat spirit. Produced by Scott Solter (Mike Patton, Okkervil River), Lightlessness can be split into two sonic halves. The first part is light and enjoyable, a natural progression of Beware and Be Grateful&apos;s danceable &quot;Fever.&quot; &quot;Fall Apart&quot; and &quot;Ringing Bell&quot; are catchy enough to resemble pop duo Miike Snow, while the jangly &quot;Fog and the Fall&quot; features an angular Afro-beat energy similar to Vampire Weekend. The second half of Lightlessness veers closer to the band&apos;s earlier sound, patiently building and meandering on explorations like &quot;Learn How to Swim&quot; and &quot;Wrong Kind of Magic.&quot; &quot;War Dreams&quot; is a highlight that synthesizes the spirits of both halves, allowing Maps &amp; Atlases the space to get weird without sacrificing their newfound hook-friendly approach. Refreshed and reinvigorated, Maps &amp; Atlases take risks that result in a major payoff on Lightlessness Is Nothing New, remaining faithful to their past while eyeing their future","last_updated":"2018-06-01T12:06:43.039Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d75238c40a4e00ac43cba62bbdfdb9768973dd2","dn":"Maps &amp; Atlases - Lightlessness Is Nothing New (2018) [FLAC]","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"7d75238c40a4e00ac43cba62bbdfdb9768973dd2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,117,35,140,64,164,224,10,196,60,186,98,187,223,219,151,104,151,61,210]},"name":"Maps &amp; Atlases - Lightlessness Is Nothing New (2018) [FLAC]","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
