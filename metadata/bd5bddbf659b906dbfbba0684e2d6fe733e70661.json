Focusing in Part I on the Olmec heads of early Mesoamerica, the colossal statues of the pharaoh Amenhotep III, and the nudes of classical Greece, Beard explores the power, hierarchy, and gender politics of the art of the ancient world, and explains how it came to define the so-called civilized world. In Part II, Beard chronicles some of the most breathtaking religious imagery ever made&#x2015;whether at Angkor Wat, Ravenna, Venice, or in the art of Jewish and Islamic calligraphers&#x2015; to show how all religions, ancient and modern, have faced irreconcilable problems in trying to picture the divine. With this classic volume, Beard redefines the Western-and male-centric legacies of Ernst Gombrich and Kenneth Clark. 92 illustrations","last_updated":"2018-09-08T12:24:54.175Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd5bddbf659b906dbfbba0684e2d6fe733e70661","dn":"How Do We Look by Mary Beard (.epub)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"bd5bddbf659b906dbfbba0684e2d6fe733e70661","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,91,221,191,101,155,144,109,191,187,160,104,78,45,111,231,51,231,6,97]},"name":"How Do We Look by Mary Beard (.epub)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
