Her geeky nature combined with her love of cooking led to the creation of geekychef.com. The goal of Geeky Chef is to help the geek community bring their food fantasies to reality. So if you&apos;ve ever found yourself drooling over Pumpkin Pasties in Harry Potter, curious about Lembas Bread from Lord of the Rings or wondering if the cake is really a lie, this blog is for you. Each dish is thoroughly researched to make the final product taste and/or look as close to the source material as possible. Of course, everyone will imagine differently, but Cassandra hopes to give dedicated geeks a run for their tastebuds.\r\nCassandra currently lives in Portland with her fiance and pet parrot. Despite what conclusions you may have come to, she is not actually a pirate. Well, she is mostly not actually a pirate.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\nBASIC PREP RECIPES\r\nNON-ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES\r\nALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES\r\nAPPETIZERS, SNACKS, AND SIDES\r\nSOUPS AND STEWS\r\nMAIN COURSES\r\nCAKES AND CUPCAKES\r\nPIES AND TARTS\r\nOTHER DESSERTS\r\nINDEX\r\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\r\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\r\n <a href=\"\nhttps://s26.postimg.org/r3erdtesp/The_Geeky_Chef_Strikes_Back.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://s26.postimg.org/r3erdtesp/The_Geeky_Chef_Strikes_Back.jpg</a>","last_updated":"2017-09-19T12:46:49.394Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ff929b302859807b1a2dd4225e665220a895c2f","dn":"The Geeky Chef Strikes Back!
