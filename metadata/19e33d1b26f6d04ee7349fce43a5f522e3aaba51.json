Some went on to create governments that were accountable to their constituents. We take these institutions for granted, but they are absent or unable to function in many of today&#x2019;s developing countries&#x2014;with often disastrous consequences for the rest of the world.\r\nFrancis Fukuyama, author of the best-selling The End of History and The Last Man, and one of our most important political thinkers, provides a sweeping account of how today&#x2019;s basic political institutions developed.\r\nThe first of a major two-volume work, The Origins of Political Order begins with politics among our primate ancestors and follows the story through the emergence of tribal societies, the growth of the first modern state in China, the beginning of the rule of law in India and the Middle East, and the development of political accountability in Europe up until the eve of the French Revolution.\r\nDrawing on a vast body of knowledge&#x2014;history, evolutionary biology, archaeology, and economics&#x2014;Fukuyama has produced a brilliant, provocative work that offers fresh insights on the origins of democratic societies and raises essential questions about the nature of politics and its discontents","last_updated":"2017-07-31T12:03:46.384Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:19e33d1b26f6d04ee7349fce43a5f522e3aaba51","dn":"The Origins of Political Order by Francis Fukuyama mp3","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"19e33d1b26f6d04ee7349fce43a5f522e3aaba51","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,227,61,27,38,246,208,78,231,52,159,206,67,165,245,34,227,170,186,81]},"name":"The Origins of Political Order by Francis Fukuyama mp3","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
