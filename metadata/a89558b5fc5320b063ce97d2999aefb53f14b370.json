This academic edition adds key terms and expression of the discussion in their scriptural Hebrew, Greek and Arabic scripts. Muslim polemicists have selectively used Western biblical criticism in an attempt to support the traditional Muslim accusation of biblical falsification. The Gentle Answer responds to the Muslim claims by placing the Bible and the Qur&apos;an on a level scholarly playing field to show that academic questions about the Qur&apos;an are at least as challenging as questions about the Bible. It builds a case for the reliability of the Bible on the basis of the astonishing discoveries of ancient manuscripts during the past century and expert analysis of the evidence. The book also reviews the growing body of critical research on the Qur&apos;an and the questions it raises about the origins and contents of the Muslim scripture. The final section of The Gentle Answer is a friendly invitation to a free and open faith conversation in a respectful and peaceable environment.\r\n\r\nPlease seed.
