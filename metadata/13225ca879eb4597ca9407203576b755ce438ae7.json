As a newcomer to the sport and a complete unknown to the press, Chrissie&apos;s win shook up the sport. A LIFE WITHOUT LIMITS is the story of her rise to the top, a journey that has taken her around the world, from a childhood in England, to the mountains of Nepal, to the oceans of New Zealand, and the trails of Argentina, and first across the finish line.\r\n\r\nWellington&apos;s first-hand, inspiring story includes all the incredible challenges she has faced--from anorexia to near--drowning to training with a controversial coach. But to Wellington, the drama of the sports also presents an opportunity to use sports to improve people&apos;s lives.\r\n\r\nA LIFE WITHOUT LIMITS reveals the heart behind Wellington&apos;s success, along with the diet, training and motivational techniques that keep her going through one of the world&apos;s most grueling events","last_updated":"2018-01-08T12:06:46.919Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:13225ca879eb4597ca9407203576b755ce438ae7","dn":"Chrissie Wellington - A Life Without Limits (epub)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"13225ca879eb4597ca9407203576b755ce438ae7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,34,92,168,121,235,69,151,202,148,7,32,53,118,183,85,206,67,138,231]},"name":"Chrissie Wellington - A Life Without Limits (epub)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
