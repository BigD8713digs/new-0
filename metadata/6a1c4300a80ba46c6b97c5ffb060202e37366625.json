It is the aim of this book to explain how such methods work in financial engineering. By concentrating on the field of option pricing, a core task of financial engineering and risk analysis, this book explores a wide range of computational tools in a coherent and focused manner and will be of use to the entire field of computational finance. Starting with an introductory chapter that presents the financial and stochastic background, the remainder of the book goes on to detail computational methods using both stochastic and deterministic approaches. \r\n\r\n---\r\n <a href=\"\nhttp://dlfeb.com/book/tools-for-computational-finance/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttp://dlfeb.com/book/tools-for-computational-finance/</a>","last_updated":"2017-08-05T12:05:36.923Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a1c4300a80ba46c6b97c5ffb060202e37366625","dn":"TOOLS FOR COMPUTATIONAL FINANCE","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"6a1c4300a80ba46c6b97c5ffb060202e37366625","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,28,67,0,168,11,164,108,107,151,197,255,176,96,32,46,55,54,102,37]},"name":"TOOLS FOR COMPUTATIONAL FINANCE","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
