For Todd and Jack Hoffman, those changes mean risking it all -- including their health -- as gold miners in the wilds of Alaska. With his aviation business grounded, Todd leases a gold claim in southeast Alaska, Porcupine Creek, the same place his father, Jack, mined in the 1980s. They recruit a small group of greenhorn miners from their Sandy, Ore., hometown, and &quot;Gold Rush: Alaska&quot; follows their efforts to strike it rich. It&apos;s the biggest gamble these men have ever taken, a last chance in the heart of &quot;The Last Frontier.&quot;","last_updated":"2018-12-07T12:12:33.830Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:7984eee4a5775bf8ff1ea9c4787565ee8fdfec40","dn":"Gold.Rush.S09E09.720p.WEBRip.x264.[425MB].[MP4]","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"7984eee4a5775bf8ff1ea9c4787565ee8fdfec40","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,132,238,228,165,119,91,248,255,30,169,196,120,117,101,238,143,223,236,64]},"name":"Gold.Rush.S09E09.720p.WEBRip.x264.[425MB].[MP4]","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
