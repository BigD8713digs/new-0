It views the human animal as a unique being, endowed with an instinctual capacity. It asks and answers an intriguing question: Why are animals in the wild, though threatened routinely, rarely traumatized? By understanding the dynamics that make wild animals virtually immune to traumatic symptoms, the mystery of human trauma is revealed. Waking the Tiger normalizes the symptoms of trauma and the steps needed to heal them. People are often traumatized by seemingly ordinary experiences. The reader is taken on a guided tour of the subtle, yet powerful impulses that govern our responses to overwhelming life events. To do this, it employs a series of exercises that help us focus on bodily sensations. Through heightened awareness of these sensations trauma can be healed.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-08-22T12:02:09.732Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:6bac665ec30e425129e0c0500a5432e669c621cb","dn":"Waking the Tiger_ Healing Trauma_ The Innate Capacity to Transfo","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"6bac665ec30e425129e0c0500a5432e669c621cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,172,102,94,195,14,66,81,41,224,192,80,10,84,50,230,105,198,33,203]},"name":"Waking the Tiger_ Healing Trauma_ The Innate Capacity to Transfo","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
