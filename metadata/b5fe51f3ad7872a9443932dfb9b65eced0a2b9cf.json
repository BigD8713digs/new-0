From that single beginning, Ferguson&apos;s life will take four simultaneous and independent fictional paths. Four identical Fergusons made of the same DNA, four boys who are the same boy, go on to lead four parallel and entirely different lives. Family fortunes diverge. Athletic skills and sex lives and friendships and intellectual passions contrast. Each Ferguson falls under the spell of the magnificent Amy Schneiderman, yet each Amy and each Ferguson have a relationship like no other. Meanwhile, readers will take in each Ferguson&apos;s pleasures and ache from each Ferguson&apos;s pains, as the mortal plot of each Ferguson&apos;s life rushes on.\r\n\r\nAs inventive and dexterously constructed as anything Paul Auster has ever written, yet with a passion for realism and a great tenderness and fierce attachment to history and to life itself that readers have never heard from Auster before. 4 3 2 1 is a marvelous and unforgettably affecting tour de force.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-10-09T12:01:01.220Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5fe51f3ad7872a9443932dfb9b65eced0a2b9cf","dn":"4321 by Paul Auster EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"b5fe51f3ad7872a9443932dfb9b65eced0a2b9cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,254,81,243,173,120,114,169,68,57,50,223,185,182,94,206,208,162,185,207]},"name":"4321 by Paul Auster EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
