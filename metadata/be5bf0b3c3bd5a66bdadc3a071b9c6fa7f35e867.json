Others interests are the biometric identification systems employing handwritten signatures, as well as the requirements from cultural heritage institutions like historical archives and libraries in order to preserve their large collections of historical (handwritten) documents. \r\n\r\nThe book is organized into two sections: \r\n- the first one is mainly devoted to describing the current state-of-the-art applications in HTR and the last advances in some of the steps involved in HTR workflow (that is, preprocessing, feature extraction, recognition engines, etc.), whereas \r\n- the second focuses more on some relevant HTR-related applications. In the second part, several systems - also developed on the basis of the fundamental concepts and general approaches outlined in the first part - are described for several HTR-related applications. Presented in the corresponding chapters, these applications cover a wide spectrum of scenarios: mathematical formulae recognition, scripting language recognition, multimodal handwriting-speech recognition, hardware design for online HTR, student performance evaluation through handwriting analysis, performance evaluation methods, keyword spotting, and handwritten signature verification systems. \r\n\r\nLast but not least, it is important to remark that to a large extent, this book is the result of works carried out by several researchers in the Handwritten Text Recognition field.\r\n <a href=\"\nhttps://i.postimg.cc/XJN4QN9t/Handwriting-Recognition-Development-and-Analysis.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://i.postimg.cc/XJN4QN9t/Handwriting-Recognition-Development-and-Analysis.jpg</a>","last_updated":"2018-11-19T12:12:00.825Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:be5bf0b3c3bd5a66bdadc3a071b9c6fa7f35e867","dn":"Handwriting - Recognition, Development and Analysis (gnv64)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"be5bf0b3c3bd5a66bdadc3a071b9c6fa7f35e867","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,91,240,179,195,189,90,102,189,173,195,160,113,185,198,250,127,53,232,103]},"name":"Handwriting - Recognition, Development and Analysis (gnv64)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
