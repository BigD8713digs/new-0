The camera can be connected to a computer via USB cable to a wired or wireless network using a wireless transmitter. In certain Nikon digital SLRs such as the D3, D700, D300 and D90 customized image adjustment, including tone compensation curve data, can be saved to tailor the camera&#x2019;s behavior to the photographer&#x2019;s vision, improving efficiency when using multiple cameras at the same time. In addition to supporting USB cable connections, Camera Control Pro offers compatibility with the optional wireless transmitter models WT-2a, WT-3a and WT-4A. When attached to a digital SLR, the WT-2a, WT-3a and WT-4A enable remote shooting and setting via a wireless LAN over WiFi. Image data can be transferred and stored without affecting the authentication function. Using the included USB or Firewire cable and/or optional WiFi adapters for select models, Nikon Camera Control Pro enables you to capture unique images no matter what the subject. Live previews direct from the camera are supported on the D3, D700, D300 and D90 when this feature is enabled. See what you are about to shoot! A simulated (camera) LCD panel on the computer screen performs the same function as the camera&#x2019;s viewfinder display which has been modified to be consistent with those used in the latest cameras for smoother operation","last_updated":"2017-05-31T12:04:46.852Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:0196f92aae6c4a11e4c1d935350b3f8fa6cfe8d8","dn":"Nikon Camera Control Pro v2.25.0   Serials [Mac OSX]","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"0196f92aae6c4a11e4c1d935350b3f8fa6cfe8d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,150,249,42,174,108,74,17,228,193,217,53,53,11,63,143,166,207,232,216]},"name":"Nikon Camera Control Pro v2.25.0   Serials [Mac OSX]","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
