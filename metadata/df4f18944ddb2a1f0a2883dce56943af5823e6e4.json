The book reads like a Faulkneresque tall tale but is, unfortunately for the main character and those around him, all-too-true.\r\n\r\nAuthor S.K. Bain finds himself caught up in the middle of something bigger and uglier than he can at first fathom. Yet, much to his dismay, he catches on rather quickly to what&#x2019;s taking place around him&#x2014;and near-simultaneously elsewhere across the county in places such as Boston, MA and West, TX&#x2014;because he&#x2019;s seen this sort of thing before. He wrote the book on it, literally, and he soon realizes just how much danger he and his family are in.\r\n\r\nThe year is 2013, the 50th anniversary of the JFK assassination, and Bain discovers that he is enmeshed in a year-long series of scripted events meticulously planned and brilliantly executed by some of the most ruthless, diabolically-creative, powerful psychopaths on the planet. As the story unfolds, it turns out that Bain has an idea who, specifically, might be behind his woes, and if he&#x2019;s correct, it&#x2019;s even less likely that he&#x2019;s going to get out alive.\r\n <a href=\"\nhttps://worldimages.gallery/images/2017/07/03/img.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://worldimages.gallery/images/2017/07/03/img.gif</a>","last_updated":"2018-05-07T12:11:48.531Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:df4f18944ddb2a1f0a2883dce56943af5823e6e4","dn":"Sherwood Kent - Most Dangerous: A True Story (2015) pdf","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"df4f18944ddb2a1f0a2883dce56943af5823e6e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,79,24,148,77,219,42,31,10,40,131,220,229,105,67,175,88,35,230,228]},"name":"Sherwood Kent - Most Dangerous: A True Story (2015) pdf","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
