His grandson, a writer, retells his story, the notebooks giving him the impetus to imagine his way into the locked chambers of Urbain&apos;s memory. He vividly recounts a whole life: Urbain as the child of a lowly church painter, retouching his father&apos;s work; dodging death in a foundry; fighting in the war that altered the course of history; marrying the sister of the woman he truly loved; haunted by an ever-present reminder of the artist he had hoped to be and the soldier he was forced to become. Wrestling with this story, Urbain&apos;s grandson straddles past and present, searching for a way to understand his own part in both.\r\n\r\nAs artfully rendered as a Renaissance fresco, War and Turpentine paints an extraordinary portrait of one man&apos;s life and reveals how that life echoed down through the generations.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-10-29T12:01:46.616Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:0bce9da9b041964f4608161b738d501a5296af0f","dn":"War and Turpentine by Stefan Hertmans EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"0bce9da9b041964f4608161b738d501a5296af0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,206,157,169,176,65,150,79,70,8,22,27,115,141,80,26,82,150,175,15]},"name":"War and Turpentine by Stefan Hertmans EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
