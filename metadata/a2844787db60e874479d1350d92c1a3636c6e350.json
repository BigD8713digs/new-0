So when her great-nephew Kaia comes home from school in tears, what she senses sends a deep fear running through her. While they wait for his mama to come home from work, Ma Taffy recalls the story of the flying preacherman and a great thing that did not happen.\r\n\r\nA poor suburban sprawl in the Jamaican heartland, Augustown is a place where many things that should happen don&apos;t, and plenty of things that shouldn&apos;t happen do. For the story of Kaia leads back to another momentous day in Jamaican history, the birth of the Rastafari, and the desire for a better life.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-11-07T12:01:13.832Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2844787db60e874479d1350d92c1a3636c6e350","dn":"Augustown by Kei Miller EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"a2844787db60e874479d1350d92c1a3636c6e350","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,132,71,135,219,96,232,116,71,157,19,80,217,44,26,54,54,198,227,80]},"name":"Augustown by Kei Miller EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
