Kaufman EPUB\r\n\r\nThe psychologist with a troubled past...\r\n\r\nDr. Christopher Kellan spends his days at Loveland Psychiatric Hospital, overseeing a unit known as Alpha Twelve, home to the most deranged and psychotic killers imaginable. His newest patient, Donny Ray Smith, is accused of murdering ten young girls and making their bodies disappear. But during his first encounter with Donny, Christopher finds something else unsettling: the man looks familiar.\r\n\r\nThe killer with a secret...\r\n\r\nDonny Ray knows things about Christopher - things he couldn&apos;t have possibly learned at Loveland. As the psychologist delves deeper into the mysterious patient&apos;s case, Christopher&apos;s life whirls out of control. The contours of his mind are rapidly losing shape, and his grasp on reality is slipping even faster. Is he going mad, or is that what Donny Ray wants him to think?\r\n\r\nThe terror that binds them...\r\n\r\nIn this taut psychological thriller from Andrew E. Kaufman, best-selling author of The Lion, the Lamb, the Hunted, a tormented man must face his fear and enter the mind of a killer to find the truth...even if it costs him his sanity.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-07-02T12:13:24.506Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a20b450986ec7b6804a003e88223cea593ddf5e","dn":"Twisted by Andrew E.
