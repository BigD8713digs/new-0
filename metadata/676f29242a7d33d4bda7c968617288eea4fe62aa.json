Their dominance of eighteenth- and nineteenth- century literature and scholarship was both hard-won - following many years of struggle - and doomed, as it led to belittlement in the twentieth century. In The Devil&apos;s Details, Chuck Zerby playfully explores footnotes&apos; long and illustrious history and makes a clarion call to save them from the new world of the Internet and hypertext.\r\n \r\nIn a story that boasts a marvelous plot and a rogues&apos; gallery of players, Zerby examines traditional footnotes and their less-buttoned-down incarnations, as when used by pornographers. Yes, The Devil&apos;s Details is full of surprises: Zerby hunts down the first bona fide fully functioning footnote; unearths a multi-volume history of Northumberland County, England, that uses one volume for a single footnote; and uncovers a murder plot. He even explains why footnotes are like blind dates.\r\n\r\nCarefully researched and highly opinionated, The Devil&apos;s Details affirms that delight in reading can come from unexpected places.\r\n\r\nPaperback: 160 pages\r\nPublisher: Touchstone; Reprint edition (March 11, 2003)","last_updated":"2017-08-30T12:01:24.732Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:676f29242a7d33d4bda7c968617288eea4fe62aa","dn":"The Devil's Details: A History of Footnotes","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"676f29242a7d33d4bda7c968617288eea4fe62aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,111,41,36,42,125,51,212,189,167,201,104,97,114,136,238,164,254,98,170]},"name":"The Devil's Details: A History of Footnotes","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
