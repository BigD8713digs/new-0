From the great mathematician Al-Khwarizmi, who did much to establish the mathematical tradition we now know as algebra, to Ibn Sina, a pioneer of early medicine whose Canon of Medicine was still in use as recently as the 19th century, Al-Khalili pieces together a remarkable story of the often-overlooked achievements of the early medieval Islamic scientists.\r\n\r\nVideo: MP4 H264 @3.0Mbps\r\nAudio: AAC 2ch @128Kbps\r\nSubtitles: English .SRT","last_updated":"2018-05-07T12:14:27.544Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:48c04f9817f5230a90c7b795b13284a902e6877b","dn":"BBC - Science and Islam 1/3 720p MP4   subs BigJ0554","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"48c04f9817f5230a90c7b795b13284a902e6877b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,192,79,152,23,245,35,10,144,199,183,149,177,50,132,169,2,230,135,123]},"name":"BBC - Science and Islam 1/3 720p MP4   subs BigJ0554","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
