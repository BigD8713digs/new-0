A fierce fighter in four critical Revolutionary War battles and a courageous survivor of Valley Forge and a near-fatal wound at the Battle of Trenton, James Monroe (1751 - 1831) went on to become America&apos;s first full-time politician, dedicating his life to securing America&apos;s national and international durability.\r\n\r\nDecorated by George Washington for his exploits as a soldier, Monroe became a congressman, a senator, U.S. minister to France and Britain, governor of Virginia, secretary of state, secretary of war, and finally America&apos;s fifth president.\r\n\r\nThe country embraced Monroe&apos;s dreams of empire and elected him to two terms, the second time unanimously. Mentored by each of Americas first four presidents, Monroe was unquestionably the best prepared president in our history.\r\n\r\nLike David McCullough&apos;s John Adams and Jon Meacham&apos;s recent book on Andrew Jackson, this new biography of Monroe is both a solid read and a stellar scholarship history in the grand tradition.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-08-07T12:01:41.341Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:4cc2b7a06a23d20a31538ef77c8c7a0523c16aaf","dn":"The Last Founding Father_ James Monroe and a Nation's Call to Gr","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"4cc2b7a06a23d20a31538ef77c8c7a0523c16aaf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,194,183,160,106,35,210,10,49,83,142,247,124,140,122,5,35,193,106,175]},"name":"The Last Founding Father_ James Monroe and a Nation's Call to Gr","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
