Gra&#xE7;a, the spoiled daughter of a wealthy sugar baron, is clever, well-fed, pretty, and thrillingly ill-behaved. Born to wildly different worlds, Dores and Gra&#xE7;a quickly bond over shared mischief and then, on a deeper level, over music. \r\n\r\nOne has a voice like a songbird; the other feels melodies in her soul and composes lyrics to match. Music will become their shared passion, the source of their partnership and their rivalry and, for each, the only way out of the life to which each was born. But only one of the two is destined to be a star. Their intimate, volatile bond will determine each of their fortunes - and haunt their memories.\r\n\r\nTraveling from Brazil&apos;s inland sugar plantations to the rowdy streets of Lapa in Rio de Janeiro, from Los Angeles during the Golden Age of Hollywood back to the irresistible drumbeat of home, The Air You Breathe unfurls a moving portrait of a lifelong friendship - its unparalleled rewards and lasting losses - and considers what we owe to the relationships that shape our lives.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-08-29T12:03:24.095Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed569a2596a6af5e6f7ae3bff98928bd55c651da","dn":"The Air You Breathe by Frances de Pontes Peebles EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"ed569a2596a6af5e6f7ae3bff98928bd55c651da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,86,154,37,150,166,175,94,111,122,227,191,249,137,40,189,85,198,81,218]},"name":"The Air You Breathe by Frances de Pontes Peebles EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
