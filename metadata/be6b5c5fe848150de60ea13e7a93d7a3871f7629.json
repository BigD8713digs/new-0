(2-CD) 2017 ak320\r\n\r\nKreator is a German thrash metal band from Essen, formed in 1982. Their style of music is similar to that of their compatriots Destruction, Sodom and Tankard, albeit usually more complex and, since 2001&apos;s Violent Revolution, more melodic. Along with those three bands, Kreator has been referred to as one of the &quot;Big 4&quot; of Teutonic thrash metal and they are often credited with helping pioneer death metal and black metal by containing several elements of what was to become those genres. The band has achieved worldwide sales of over two million units for combined sales of all their albums, making them one of the best-selling German thrash metal bands of all time.\r\n\r\n\r\nTracklist\r\n\r\n01 - Choir of the Dammed.mp3\r\n02 - Hordes of Chaos (A Necrologue for the Elite).mp3\r\n03 - Phobia.mp3\r\n04 - Satan Is Real.mp3\r\n05 - Gods of Violence.mp3\r\n06 - People of the Lie.mp3\r\n07 - Total Death.mp3\r\n08 - Mars Mantra.mp3\r\n09 - Phantom Antichrist.mp3\r\n10 - Fallen Brother.mp3\r\n11 - Enemy of God.mp3\r\n12 - From Flood into Fire.mp3\r\n\r\nDisk 2\r\n\r\n13 - Apocalypticon.mp3\r\n14 - World War Now.mp3\r\n15 - Hail to the Hordes.mp3\r\n16 - Extreme Aggression.mp3\r\n17 - Civilization Collapse.mp3\r\n18 - The Patriarch.mp3\r\n19 - Violent Revolution.mp3\r\n20 - Flag of Hate.mp3\r\n21 - Under the Guillotine.mp3\r\n22 - Pleasure to Kill.mp3\r\n23 - Death Becomes My Light.mp3\r\n\r\nCurrent line up\r\n\r\n    Miland &quot;Mille&quot; Petrozza &#x2013; vocals, guitar (1982&#x2013;present)\r\n    J&#xFC;rgen &quot;Ventor&quot; Reil &#x2013; drums, vocals (1982&#x2013;1994, 1996&#x2013;present)\r\n    Christian &quot;Speesy&quot; Giesler &#x2013; bass (1994&#x2013;present)\r\n    Sami Yli-Sirni&#xF6; &#x2013; guitar (2001&#x2013;present)","last_updated":"2017-05-09T19:33:41.671Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:be6b5c5fe848150de60ea13e7a93d7a3871f7629","dn":"Kreator - Live from The Desert, Mesa AZ.
