It&apos;s an aesthetic that weaves its way throughout much of the album, and brothers Dylan, Daniel, Jesse, and Johnny Kongos, the sons of South African singer/songwriter John Kongos (who hit it big in 1971 with the single &quot;He&apos;s Gonna Step on You Again&quot;), generate a huge sound for a four-piece. The sleek, circular, and piston-like &quot;Come with Me,&quot; with its relentless, accordion-driven Soweto pulse and slick, falsetto-driven modern rock flourishes, sounds like Rammstein riffing off of Paul Simon&apos;s &quot;Boy in the Bubble, while the more refined, yet no less danceable &quot;I Want to Know&quot; dims the lights for a bout of churning, midtempo reggae with electro-pop tentacles. The worldbeat influences are applied relatively seamlessly throughout, though each of the 12 tracks are, at their heart, radio-ready slabs of stylish alt-rock in the vein of Kings of Leon, pre-Kid A-era Radiohead, and even Coldplay. There&apos;s a wan, vaguely Everyman lyricism at work here as well, which makes some of the slower numbers a bit of a chore, but when the band lets it rip, as in the case of top-down, desert road jams like &quot;Hey I Don&apos;t Know,&quot; &quot;It&apos;s a Good Life,&quot; and the aforementioned &quot;Come with Me,&quot; Lunatic earns the shifty weight of its unhinged moniker","last_updated":"2018-06-14T12:06:42.910Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:97765b718a661d87393ac9f6e3ab550b565968c8","dn":"Kongos - Lunatic (2014) [16.44 FLAC]","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"97765b718a661d87393ac9f6e3ab550b565968c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,118,91,113,138,102,29,135,57,58,201,246,227,171,85,11,86,89,104,200]},"name":"Kongos - Lunatic (2014) [16.44 FLAC]","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
