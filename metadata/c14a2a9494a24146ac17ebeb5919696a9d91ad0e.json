Upon an introductory chapter on analytical methods and strategies, the full bandwidth of applications is discussed. Expert chapter authors cast spotlights on recent topics such as metallomics applications to environmental and nutrition studies as well as biology and medicine. Special chapters deal with the impact of manganese and iron on neurodegeneration, and the impact of nanoparticles on health","last_updated":"2017-05-29T13:15:26.520Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:c14a2a9494a24146ac17ebeb5919696a9d91ad0e","dn":"Metallomics - Analytical Techniques and Speciation Methods","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"c14a2a9494a24146ac17ebeb5919696a9d91ad0e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,74,42,148,148,162,65,70,172,23,235,235,89,25,105,106,157,145,173,14]},"name":"Metallomics - Analytical Techniques and Speciation Methods","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
