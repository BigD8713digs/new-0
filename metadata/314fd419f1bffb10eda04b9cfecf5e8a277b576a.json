Sparling (AP, 2016).pdf\r\n\r\nEcotoxicology Essentials: Environmental Contaminants and Their Biological Effects on Animals and Plants provides a fundamental understanding of this area for students and professionals in ecotoxicology, ecology, conservation, chemistry, public health, wildlife management, fisheries, and many other disciplines. Although new chemicals and potential problems are developed every year, a basic education is essential to address these new challenges, and this work gives such training. Written with the regulatory framework in mind, the material guides readers on modelling, how to conduct assessments, and human and wildlife risk, focusing on effects on animals rather than transport of chemicals. Simple discussions of chemistry are complemented by coverage on the behavior of the animal, dynamics of the ecosystem, real-life situations like drought, and predators in the system &#x2013; i.e., the natural system versus the lab setting.\r\n\r\nThe book&#x2019;s first section contains chapters on the principles of contaminant toxicology including a brief history of the science of ecotoxicology, basic principles of the science, testing methods, and ways of determining if animals have been exposed to either acute or chronic concentrations of contaminants. The second section deals with the primary classes of contaminants including their chemical characteristics, sources, uses, and effects on organisms. The third section focuses on more complex issues such as the regulation of pollution, population and community effects, risk assessment and modelling.\r\n\r\nUses examples from both aquatic and terrestrial environments and species\r\nIncludes a Terms to Know section and a list of study questions in each chapter, fostering a greater understanding of the issues\r\nFocuses on the effects of contaminants on wildlife while providing enough chemistry to allow a detailed understanding of the various contaminant groups\r\nEmphasizes natural examples and &apos;real&apos; species, rather than laboratory studies on only a handful of organisms\r\nFeatures case histories, detailing actual events that include aspects of how the contamination occurred and its effects on wildlife\r\nProvides material from a wide variety of international sources","last_updated":"2017-05-31T11:02:56.129Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:314fd419f1bffb10eda04b9cfecf5e8a277b576a","dn":"Ecotoxicology Essentials - Environmental Contaminants and Their ","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"314fd419f1bffb10eda04b9cfecf5e8a277b576a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,79,212,25,241,191,251,16,237,160,75,156,254,207,94,138,39,123,87,106]},"name":"Ecotoxicology Essentials - Environmental Contaminants and Their ","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
