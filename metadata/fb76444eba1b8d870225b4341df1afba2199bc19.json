The creative and technical logistics that go into building today&apos;s hottest games can be more harrowing and complex than the games themselves, often seeming like an endless maze or a bottomless abyss. In Blood, Sweat, and Pixels, Jason Schreier takes readers on a fascinating odyssey behind the scenes of video game development, where the creator may be a team of 600 overworked underdogs or a solitary geek genius. Exploring the artistic challenges, technical impossibilities, marketplace demands, and Donkey Kong-sized monkey wrenches thrown into the works by corporate, Blood, Sweat, and Pixels reveals how bringing any game to completion is more than Sisyphean&#x2014;it&apos;s nothing short of miraculous.\r\n\r\nTaking some of the most popular, bestselling recent games, Schreier immerses readers in the hellfire of the development process, whether it&apos;s RPG studio Bioware&apos;s challenge to beat an impossible schedule and overcome countless technical nightmares to build Dragon Age: Inquisition; indie developer Eric Barone&apos;s single-handed efforts to grow country-life RPG Stardew Valley from one man&apos;s vision into a multi-million-dollar franchise; or Bungie spinning out from their corporate overlords at Microsoft to create Destiny, a brand new universe that they hoped would become as iconic as Star Wars and Lord of the Rings&#x2014;even as it nearly ripped their studio apart.\r\n\r\nDocumenting the round-the-clock crunches, buggy-eyed burnout, and last-minute saves, Blood, Sweat, and Pixels is a journey through development hell&#x2014;and ultimately a tribute to the dedicated diehards and unsung heroes who scale mountains of obstacles in their quests to create the best games imaginable.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-09-05T12:00:28.482Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb76444eba1b8d870225b4341df1afba2199bc19","dn":"Blood, Sweat, and Pixels_ The Triumphant, Turbulent Stories Behi","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"fb76444eba1b8d870225b4341df1afba2199bc19","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,118,68,78,186,27,141,135,2,37,180,52,29,241,175,186,33,153,188,25]},"name":"Blood, Sweat, and Pixels_ The Triumphant, Turbulent Stories Behi","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
