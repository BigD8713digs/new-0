Just about everyone has at least one bottle of vinegar in the pantry, but not many realize how much better the homemade kind tastes&#x2014;the flavor is incomparable. And it&apos;s easy make; all you need is a bottle of your favorite alcoholic beverage, a starter (or mother of vinegar), and a few weeks of hands-off time.\r\nVinegar Revival shows you how to use homemade or store-bought vinegar--made from apple cider, beer, wine, fruit scraps, herbs, and more--to great effect with more than 50 recipes. Here are drinks and cocktails (Strawberry Rhubarb Shrub, Switchel, and Mint Vinegar Julep), pickles (Cured Grapes and Pickled Whole Garlic), sauces and vinaigrettes (Roasted Hot Sauce and Miso-Ginger Dressing), mains and sides (Saucy Piquant Pork Chops and Roasted Red Cabbage), and dessert (Vinegar Pie and Balsamic Ice Cream). Whether you want to experiment with home brewing or just add a little zing to your meals, Vinegar Revival demystifies the process of making and tasting vinegar.\r\n\r\nAbout the Author\r\nHARRY ROSENBLUM is the co-owner of The Brooklyn Kitchen, a specialty kitchen supply store and grocer in Williamsburg that offers quality tools, technique-based cooking classes, and locally-sourced groceries.
