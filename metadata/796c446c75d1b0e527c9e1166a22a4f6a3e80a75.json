You are an (un)lucky contestant in Killing Room, a \r\npopular reality-show in a decadent 22nd century. You know that there is \r\nonly glory or death &#x2013; with death winning in 99 out of 100 cases.&#xA0;First person shooterKilling\r\n Room offers classical first person gunplay with many weapons, even \r\nmelee ones like Scythe or the  audience&#x2019;s favorite flyswatter.Rogue-likeThere\r\n is Permanent death, random generation and very high difficulty in \r\nKilling Room so as to ensure that your skills will be properly tested \r\nand that every wrong move can cause you a lot of trouble.Reality-show parody\r\n We love the  idea behind the Smash TV game of the  Running Man \r\nmovie/book. The Killing Room therefore aims for this. Your character is \r\nin a bad situation but he can become ridiculously rich in few hours. \r\nHowever, everyone will do everything possible to stop him.
