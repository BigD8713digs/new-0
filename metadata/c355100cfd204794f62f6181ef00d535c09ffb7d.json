They received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2011 and were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002. Marky Ramone played a major part in this success - his &quot;blitzkrieg&quot; style of drumming drove the sound the Ramones pioneered. Now fans can get the inside story.\r\n\r\nHaving outlived his bandmates, Marky is the only person who can share the secrets and stories of the Ramones&apos; improbable rise from obtuse beginnings to induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. But it wasn&apos;t all good times and hit songs, and Marky doesn&apos;t shy away from discussing his own struggles.\r\n\r\nFrom the cult film Rock &apos;n&apos; Roll High School through &quot;I Wanna Be Sedated&quot; through his own struggle with alcoholism, Marky Ramone sets the record straight, painting an unflinching picture of the dysfunction behind the band that changed a generation.\r\n\r\nPunk Rock Blitzkrieg is both a cultural history of punk and a stirring story that millions of fans have been waiting for.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-10-02T12:03:20.917Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:c355100cfd204794f62f6181ef00d535c09ffb7d","dn":"Punk Rock Blitzkrieg_ My Life as a Ramone by Marky Ramone and Ri","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"c355100cfd204794f62f6181ef00d535c09ffb7d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,85,16,12,253,32,71,148,246,47,97,129,239,0,213,53,192,159,251,125]},"name":"Punk Rock Blitzkrieg_ My Life as a Ramone by Marky Ramone and Ri","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
