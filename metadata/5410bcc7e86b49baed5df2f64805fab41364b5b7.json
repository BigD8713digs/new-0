For the first challenge, the chefs have 30 minutes to take one tropical fruit and serve it two ways, but no two chefs can use the same fruit. Judges Damaris Phillips and Jamika Pessoa are joined by Genius Kitchen&apos;s Courtney Rada to pick which chef used their tropical fruit the best. The winning chef gains access to the special ingredient cooler in the second heat, where they&apos;ll have 60 minutes to prepare an entire summer dinner with a popular travel destination theme. One chef&apos;s summer vacation ends, and the last three chefs move on to the finale and a chance to win $25,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal Air Date: 19-Aug-2018","last_updated":"2018-08-22T12:09:59.759Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:5410bcc7e86b49baed5df2f64805fab41364b5b7","dn":"Ultimate.Summer.Cook-Off.S01E03.Summer.Vacation.WEB.h264-CAFFEiN","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"5410bcc7e86b49baed5df2f64805fab41364b5b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,16,188,199,232,107,73,186,237,93,242,246,72,5,250,180,19,100,181,183]},"name":"Ultimate.Summer.Cook-Off.S01E03.Summer.Vacation.WEB.h264-CAFFEiN","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
