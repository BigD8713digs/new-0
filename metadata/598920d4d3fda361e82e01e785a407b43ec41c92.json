A firm whose business model is the mass capture of attention for resale to advertisers.\r\n\r\nIn nearly every moment of our waking lives, we face a barrage of advertising enticements, branding efforts, sponsored social media, commercials and other efforts to harvest our attention. Over the last century, few times or spaces have remained uncultivated by the &quot;attention merchants&quot;, contributing to the distracted, unfocused tenor of our times. Tim Wu argues that this is not simply the byproduct of recent inventions but the end result of more than a century&apos;s growth and expansion in the industries that feed on human attention. From the pre-Madison Avenue birth of advertising to TV&apos;s golden age to our present age of radically individualized choices, the business model of &quot;attention merchants&quot; has always been the same. He describes the revolts that have risen against these relentless attempts to influence our consumption, from the remote control to FDA regulations to Apple&apos;s ad-blocking OS. But he makes clear that attention merchants grow ever-new heads, and their means of harvesting our attention have given rise to the defining industries of our time, changing our nature - cognitive, social, and otherwise - in ways unimaginable even a generation ago","last_updated":"2017-06-14T12:00:47.691Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:598920d4d3fda361e82e01e785a407b43ec41c92","dn":"Tim Wu - The Attention Merchants 2016 RETAiL ePUB eBOOK-DiSTRiBU","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"598920d4d3fda361e82e01e785a407b43ec41c92","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,137,32,212,211,253,163,97,232,46,1,231,133,164,7,180,62,196,28,146]},"name":"Tim Wu - The Attention Merchants 2016 RETAiL ePUB eBOOK-DiSTRiBU","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
