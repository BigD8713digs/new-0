He performed public guerrilla theater to shame slave masters, insisting that human bondage violated the fundamental principles of Christianity. He wrote a fiery, controversial book against bondage that Benjamin Franklin published in 1738. He lived in a cave, made his own clothes, refused to consume anything produced by slave labor, championed animal rights, and embraced vegetarianism. He acted on his ideals to create a new, practical, revolutionary way of life.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-10-24T12:17:49.987Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:b988058f5d7822f6723ac74bf0f0ce6aa69b81e0","dn":"The Fearless Benjamin Lay by Marcus Rediker EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"b988058f5d7822f6723ac74bf0f0ce6aa69b81e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,136,5,143,93,120,34,246,114,58,199,75,240,240,206,106,166,155,129,224]},"name":"The Fearless Benjamin Lay by Marcus Rediker EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
