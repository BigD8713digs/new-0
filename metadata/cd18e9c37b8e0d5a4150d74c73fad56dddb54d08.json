He shows how to read political headlines, black markets, the price of onions, and billionaire rankings as signals of booms, busts, and protests.\r\n\r\nSet in a postcrisis age that has turned the world upside down, replacing fast growth with low growth and political calm with revolt, Sharma&apos;s pioneering book is an entertaining field guide to understanding change in this era or any era.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-01-05T12:01:36.727Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd18e9c37b8e0d5a4150d74c73fad56dddb54d08","dn":"The Rise and Fall of Nations by Ruchir Sharma EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"cd18e9c37b8e0d5a4150d74c73fad56dddb54d08","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,24,233,195,123,142,13,90,65,80,215,76,115,250,213,109,221,181,77,8]},"name":"The Rise and Fall of Nations by Ruchir Sharma EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
