Richard Ford&apos;s parents - Edna, a feisty, pretty Catholic-school girl with a difficult past; and Parker, a sweet-natured, soft-spoken traveling salesman - were rural Arkansans born at the turn of the 20th century. Married in 1928, they lived &quot;alone together&quot; on the road, traveling throughout the South. Eventually they had one child, born late, in 1944.\r\n\r\nFor Ford, the questions of what his parents dreamed of, how they loved each other and loved him become a striking portrait of American life in the midcentury. Between Them is his vivid image of where his life began and where his parents&apos; lives found their greatest satisfaction.\r\n\r\nBringing his celebrated candor, wit, and intelligence to this most intimate and mysterious of landscapes - our parents&apos; lives - the award-winning storyteller and creator of the iconic Frank Bascombe delivers an unforgettable exploration of memory, intimacy, and love.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-07-11T12:00:21.386Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8823e6d9066e4abc944794c230e37fe477a95ad","dn":"Richard Ford - Between Them 2017 RETAiL ePUB eBOOK-DiSTRiBUTiON","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"b8823e6d9066e4abc944794c230e37fe477a95ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,130,62,109,144,102,228,171,201,68,121,76,35,14,55,254,71,122,149,173]},"name":"Richard Ford - Between Them 2017 RETAiL ePUB eBOOK-DiSTRiBUTiON","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
