The debut from &quot;blink v3.0&quot; features new guitarist Matt Skiba, the Alkaline Trio frontman who replaced founding member Tom DeLonge in 2015. Skiba joins Mark Hoppus and Travis Barker on an album that is both a return to form and an admirable maturation of the band&apos;s classic pop-punk sound. Whereas 2003&apos;s self-titled album had its moments, the 2011 follow-up Neighborhoods was an uninspired, stale comeback from a trio that had lost its heart and sense of fun. In the end, they sounded like imitations of younger bands they helped inspire. With California, blink-182 are free from the drama, reinjecting much-needed vitality and spirit back into the catalog","last_updated":"2017-11-20T12:06:24.114Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:1bd455e276bba25e744fa72398f07bec8c69f38a","dn":"Blink 182 - California (2016) [24.44 FLAC]","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"1bd455e276bba25e744fa72398f07bec8c69f38a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,212,85,226,118,187,162,94,116,79,167,35,152,240,123,236,140,105,243,138]},"name":"Blink 182 - California (2016) [24.44 FLAC]","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
