A largely self-taught improviser, he works in a vast array of creative contexts. His own highly distinctive soundworld is forged through the search to reconcile both his love of free improvisation and profound fascination with composition and structure.\r\nHis writing has been said to represent &#x2018;a fundamental reassertion of composition within improvised music&#x2019; (Point of Departure), and his voice one of the &#x2018;most vividly distinctive...in modern jazz&#x2019; (The Jazzmann).\r\nAs a pianist, he has been described as &#x2018;remarkable...possessing staggering technical ability and a fecund imagination as both player and composer.&#x2019; Concerning his organ playing, critic Brian Morton recently commented that &#x2018;[t]he most interesting Hammond player of the last decade and more, [Hawkins] has already extended what can be done on the instrument.&#x2019; - alexanderhawkinsmusic.com","last_updated":"2017-08-13T12:03:49.428Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:253f4d71dfb613db3070d971cf35d4ae93f9ae56","dn":"Alexander Hawkins Ensemble 2009 No Now Is So","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"253f4d71dfb613db3070d971cf35d4ae93f9ae56","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,63,77,113,223,182,19,219,48,112,217,113,207,53,212,174,147,249,174,86]},"name":"Alexander Hawkins Ensemble 2009 No Now Is So","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
