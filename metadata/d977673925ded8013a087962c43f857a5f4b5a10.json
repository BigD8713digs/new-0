His past is a closed book and he likes it that way. But when the Atlantis team trigger a trap that leaves them stranded on a hostile world, only Ronon&apos;s past can save them - if it doesn&apos;t kill them first. As the gripping tale unfolds, we return to Ronon&apos;s earliest days as a Runner and meet the charismatic leader who transformed him into a hunter of Wraith. But grief and rage can change the best of men and it soon becomes clear that those Ronon once considered brothers-in-arms are now on the hunt - and that the Atlantis team are their prey. Unless Ronon can out hunt the hunters, Colonel Sheppard&apos;s team will fall victim to the vengeance of the V&apos;rdai. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOfficial AnonCrypt accounts: \r\nOfficial AnonCrypt accounts:  <a href=\"\nhttps://1337x.to/user/AnonCrypt/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://1337x.to/user/AnonCrypt/</a>  <a href=\"\nhttps://thepiratebay.org/user/AnonCrypt/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://thepiratebay.org/user/AnonCrypt/</a>  <a href=\"\nhttps://katcr.co/user/AnonCrypt/profile/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://katcr.co/user/AnonCrypt/profile/</a>  <a href=\"\nhttps://www.torrentfunk.com/user/anoncrypt.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://www.torrentfunk.com/user/anoncrypt.html</a> \r\r\n\r\n- Please see our newest torrents for an updated list - \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- Please see our newest torrents for an updated list","last_updated":"2018-07-14T12:01:54.803Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:d977673925ded8013a087962c43f857a5f4b5a10","dn":"Stargate Atlantis - Hunt and Run - SGA-13 - Fandemonium","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"d977673925ded8013a087962c43f857a5f4b5a10","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,119,103,57,37,222,216,1,58,8,121,98,196,63,133,122,95,75,90,16]},"name":"Stargate Atlantis - Hunt and Run - SGA-13 - Fandemonium","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
