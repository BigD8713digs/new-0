Surely the headaches and visions he&apos;s experiencing are proof of a mental connection to the Stone Man. Clearly his dreams of champagne and notoriety are all about to be fulfilled once he uncovers the truth...and the scoop of a lifetime.\r\n\r\nIn a pursuit that carries him the length of the country and the breadth of the Atlantic, Andy uncovers the jagged pieces of an increasingly terrifying puzzle. As the number of lives lost in the wake of the Stone Man reaches grim figures, the terrible results of Andy&apos;s blind determination force him to confront the savagery of human nature.\r\n\r\nWhen irresistible forces aren&apos;t met by immovable objects, how far is too far? Andy must discover the answer - and find out who he really is - in the shadow of the Stone Man.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-10-05T12:01:07.967Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:89a93a7f830a864fb9cf49deab14711b3891b973","dn":"The Stone Man_ A Fiction Horror Novel by Luke Smitherd e","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"89a93a7f830a864fb9cf49deab14711b3891b973","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,169,58,127,131,10,134,79,185,207,73,222,171,20,113,27,56,145,185,115]},"name":"The Stone Man_ A Fiction Horror Novel by Luke Smitherd e","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
