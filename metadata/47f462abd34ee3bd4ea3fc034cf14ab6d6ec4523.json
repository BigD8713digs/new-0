Yet like millions of others who suffered during Stalin&apos;s reign of terror, she was arrested&#x2014;on trumped-up charges of being a Trotskyist terrorist and counter-revolutionary&#x2014;and sentenced to prison. With an amazing eye for detail, profound strength, and an indefatigable spirit, Ginzburg recounts the years, days, and minutes she endured in prisons and labor camps, including two years of solitary confinement. A classic account of survival, Journey into the Whirlwind is considered one of the most important documents of Stalin&apos;s regime","last_updated":"2018-03-15T12:11:11.539Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:47f462abd34ee3bd4ea3fc034cf14ab6d6ec4523","dn":" Journey into the Whirlwind.A memoir of the Great Purge","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"47f462abd34ee3bd4ea3fc034cf14ab6d6ec4523","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,244,98,171,211,78,227,189,78,163,252,3,76,241,74,182,214,236,69,35]},"name":" Journey into the Whirlwind.A memoir of the Great Purge","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
