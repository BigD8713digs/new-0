When it finally closed, he was broke and unsure what to do next. Then a stranded vanload of puppies changed his life forever.\r\n\r\nJoin journalist Peter Zheutlin as he travels with Greg from Ohio to the Gulf Coast on his Rescue Road Trips to bring hard-luck dogs from the Deep South to loving &quot;forever families&quot; up north, with the help of many selfless volunteers along the way. From Houston&apos;s impoverished Fifth Ward - where thousands of strays roam the streets - and high-kill shelters in Louisiana to joyous scenes of adopters embracing their new pups in the Northeast, Rescue Road is full of heart: an inspiring story about the unique bond between dogs and humans and how going the extra mile can make a life-changing difference for these loyal canines - and for us all.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-12-03T12:01:00.544Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:15eeb4aca23e44d326ee82ccccf14b04b819cf09","dn":"Rescue Road by Peter Zheutlin PDF","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"15eeb4aca23e44d326ee82ccccf14b04b819cf09","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,238,180,172,162,62,68,211,38,238,130,204,204,241,75,4,184,25,207,9]},"name":"Rescue Road by Peter Zheutlin PDF","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
