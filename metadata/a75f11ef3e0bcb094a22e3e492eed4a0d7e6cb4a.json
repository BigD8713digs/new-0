Fifty-eight year old Dr David Galbraith, a sadistic predatory paedophile employed as a consultant child psychiatrist, has already murdered one child in the soundproofed cellar below the South Wales Georgian town-house he shares with his wife and two young daughters. Anthony becomes Galbraith&apos;s latest obsession, and he will stop at nothing to make his grotesque fantasies reality. The novel is entirely fictional, but draws on my experiences as a police officer, child protection social worker, manager and trainer. During my career I was faced with case after case that left me incredulous as to the harm sexual predators chose to inflict on their victims. The book reflects that reality. The story is set in 1992, a more naive time when many found it extremely difficult to believe that a significant number of adults posed a serious risk to children. The book contains content that some readers may find disturbing from the start. It is dedicated to survivors everywhere","last_updated":"2018-08-20T12:10:11.579Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:a75f11ef3e0bcb094a22e3e492eed4a0d7e6cb4a","dn":" John Nicholl - White Is the Coldest Colour  (epub)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"a75f11ef3e0bcb094a22e3e492eed4a0d7e6cb4a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,95,17,239,62,11,203,9,74,34,227,228,146,238,212,160,215,230,203,74]},"name":" John Nicholl - White Is the Coldest Colour  (epub)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
