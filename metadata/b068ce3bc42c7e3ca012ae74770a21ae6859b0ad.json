England is at war. As Evie Elliott watches her brother, Will, and his best friend, Thomas Harding, depart for the front, she believes - as everyone does - that it will be over by Christmas, when the trio plan to celebrate the holiday among the romantic caf&#xE9;s of Paris.\r\n\r\nBut as history tells us, it all happened so differently....\r\n\r\nEvie and Thomas experience a very different war. Frustrated by life as a privileged young lady, Evie longs to play a greater part in the conflict - but how? - and as Thomas struggles with the unimaginable realities of war, he also faces personal battles back home, where War Office regulations on press reporting cause trouble at his father&apos;s newspaper business. Through their letters Evie and Thomas share their greatest hopes and fears - and grow ever fonder from afar. Can love flourish amid the horror of the First World War, or will fate intervene?\r\n\r\nChristmas 1968. With failing health, Thomas returns to Paris - a cherished packet of letters in hand - determined to lay to rest the ghosts of his past. But one final letter is waiting for him....\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-10-07T12:05:46.703Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:b068ce3bc42c7e3ca012ae74770a21ae6859b0ad","dn":"Last Christmas in Paris_ A Novel of World War I by Hazel Gaynor ","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"b068ce3bc42c7e3ca012ae74770a21ae6859b0ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,104,206,59,196,44,126,60,160,18,174,116,119,10,33,174,104,89,176,173]},"name":"Last Christmas in Paris_ A Novel of World War I by Hazel Gaynor ","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
