Born in 1940 as Richard Starkey in the Dingle, one of Liverpool&apos;s most gritty, rough-and-tumble neighborhoods, he rose from a hardscrabble childhood marked by serious illnesses, long hospital stays, and little schooling to emerge, against all odds, as a locally renowned drummer. Taking the stage name Ringo Starr, his big break with the Beatles rocketed him to the pinnacle of worldwide acclaim in a remarkably short time. He was the last member of the Beatles to join the group but also the most vulnerable, and his post-Beatles career was marked by chart-topping successes, a jet-setting life of excess and alcohol abuse, and, ultimately, his rebirth as one of rock&apos;s revered elder statesmen.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-03-15T12:00:23.900Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba2b22f1486e7f18f3cca734bae141932f76d36e","dn":"Ringo: With a Little Help by Michael Seth Starr AZW","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"ba2b22f1486e7f18f3cca734bae141932f76d36e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,43,34,241,72,110,127,24,243,204,167,52,186,225,65,147,47,118,211,110]},"name":"Ringo: With a Little Help by Michael Seth Starr AZW","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
