One day, Anna starts to vomit, and when examined by her doctor, he does not find anything abnormal. On March 20, 2008, Anna wakes up her family at midnight because of an intense stomach pain severe enough that her parents decide to take her to the hospital. Doctors find no signs of illness, except to say it could be either acid reflux, or lactose intolerance, but Christy is not convinced by this. The following morning, Christy finally finds a pediatrician in the hospital that is able to diagnose Anna with an abdominal obstruction, and he tells them he must operate immediately or she will die. After emergency surgery is performed, the doctor explains that Anna has been left with pseudo-obstruction motility disorder and she is unable to eat, so feeding tubes are needed for her nutrition.\r\nThe doctor then tells the Beams&apos; about America&apos;s foremost pediatric gastroenterologist, Dr. Nurko, who practices in Boston, but explains it could take months for them to be seen. In January 2009, Christy and Anna travel to Boston despite not having an appointment with the doctor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Info\r\n\r\nCompression: No\r\nMovie Quality: DVD9\r\nSize: 6678 Mb\r\nLanguages: English, German, Italian Ac3 5.1\r\nSubtitles: English, German, Italian, Turkish\r\nColors\r\nRuntime: 104 min.\r\nMenu: Yes (English, German, Italian, Turkish)\r\nExtra: Yes\r\n\r\n\r\n <a href=\"\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt4257926/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt4257926/</a>","last_updated":"2017-12-03T12:01:00.142Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:e5e413d3743aea9ea70d942a400c323dd168483c","dn":"Miracles From Heaven-Miracoli Dal Cielo(2016)[DVD9-Eng Deu Ita]","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"e5e413d3743aea9ea70d942a400c323dd168483c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,228,19,211,116,58,234,158,167,13,148,42,64,12,50,61,209,104,72,60]},"name":"Miracles From Heaven-Miracoli Dal Cielo(2016)[DVD9-Eng Deu Ita]","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
