Yet he does nothing. Legally, what can he do? Only watch and wait. And hope his mounting fears are not realized.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment its shadow falls over Three Pines, Gamache suspects the creature has deep roots and a dark purpose. When it suddenly vanishes and a body is discovered, it falls to Gamache to discover if a debt has been paid or levied.\r\n\r\nIn the early days of the investigation into the murder, and months later, as the trial for the accused begins in a Montreal courtroom on a steamy day in July, the Chief Superintendent continues to struggle with actions he&#x2019;s set in motion, from which there is no going back. &#x201C;This case began in a higher court,&#x201D; he tells the judge, &#x201C;and it&#x2019;s going to end there.&#x201D;\r\n\r\nAnd regardless of the trial&#x2019;s outcome, he must face his own conscience.\r\n\r\nIn her latest utterly gripping book, number-one New York Times bestselling author Louise Penny shatters the conventions of the crime novel to explore what Gandhi called the court of conscience. A court that supersedes all others","last_updated":"2017-09-20T12:12:54.564Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:7cd26ac8ef50d7816610c921502f7e8913d1867a","dn":"Glass Houses by Louise Penny ePub","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"7cd26ac8ef50d7816610c921502f7e8913d1867a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,210,106,200,239,80,215,129,102,16,201,33,80,47,126,137,19,209,134,122]},"name":"Glass Houses by Louise Penny ePub","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
