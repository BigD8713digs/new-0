Anatomical localisation has revealed that the frontal lobes can be divided into sub-regions with different functional domains. As a result, a number of authors working in the frontal lobe literature have made a case for patients with frontal lobe damage to be considered in their distinct subgroups, rather than considered together in one unitary group. As a result, it is important for clinicians and researchers to be made aware of the functions assessed by individual frontal tests and understand which frontal regions might be impaired in their patient groups, as patients with damage to one of these regions will perform poorly on tasks tapping that region yet may perform well on tasks tapping the unaffected regions within the frontal lobes. \r\n\r\n---\r\n <a href=\"\nhttp://dlfeb.com/book/handbook-of-frontal-lobe-assessment/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttp://dlfeb.com/book/handbook-of-frontal-lobe-assessment/</a>","last_updated":"2017-07-23T12:01:15.815Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0ab881f954ab01ef861e3269f8508419190f46d","dn":"HANDBOOK OF FRONTAL LOBE ASSESSMENT","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"b0ab881f954ab01ef861e3269f8508419190f46d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,171,136,31,149,74,176,30,248,97,227,38,159,133,8,65,145,144,244,109]},"name":"HANDBOOK OF FRONTAL LOBE ASSESSMENT","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
