The CD brings together the full tracks from 2 albums that Shavers recorded with pianist Ray Bryant &#x2013; Memorial, from 1959, and Here Comes Charlie, from 1960 &#x2013; both of them well-crafted sets that are a great example of Shaver&apos;s understated genius. The rhythms on both records are surprisingly complex &#x2013; thanks to free drum work on the kit from Roy Burns, modern bass tones from Aaron Bell, and always-soulful work on piano from Ray Bryant &#x2013; and if we had to pick one album as our favorite, we&apos;d say that we&apos;re especially flored by the Here Comes Charlie set &#x2013; as it goves far beyond even our already high opinion of Shaver&apos;s talents.\r\n\r\nContains:\r\n- &#x201C;Memorial&#x201D; (complete LP)\r\n- &#x201C;Here Comes Charlie&#x201D; (complete LP)\r\n- &#x201C;At Le Crazy Horse Saloon&#x201D; (3 tracks)\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTracklist:\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n01.
