Kennedy\r\nNarrated by Paul Michael\r\nLength: 11 hrs and 47 mins\r\nUnabridged\r\n\r\nHappiness and success are habits. So are failure and misery. Habits can be changed, and Psycho-Cybernetics shows you how. Focusing on the mind-body connection, Psycho-Cybernetics demonstrates how to turn crises into creative opportunities, dehypnotize yourself from false beliefs, and celebrate new freedom from fear and guilt.\r\n\r\nDr. Maxwell Maltz was a renowned pioneer in plastic surgery when he noticed that while the outward changes to his patients were a success, an inner healing and transformation was necessary for them to achieve the life changes they were seeking. Psycho-Cybernetics is a masterful synthesis of proven psychological and physiological processes, which took Dr. Maltz 29 years of research and testing to develop.\r\n\r\nPsycho-cybernetics is a term coined by Dr. Maxwell Maltz that means &quot;steering your mind to a productive, useful goal. Maltz was the first researcher and author to explain how the self-image (a term he popularized) has complete control over an individual&apos;s ability to achieve (or failure to achieve) any goal.\r\n\r\nThe teachings of psycho-cybernetics are timeless because they are based on solid science and provide a prescription for thinking and acting that lead to quantifiable results","last_updated":"2018-05-28T12:12:52.010Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:d1413888a11a3716d864d4a9b1355eb4adebca7d","dn":"The New Psycho Cybernetics - Maxwell Maltz - Audiobook mp3","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"d1413888a11a3716d864d4a9b1355eb4adebca7d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,65,56,136,161,26,55,22,216,100,212,169,177,53,94,180,173,235,202,125]},"name":"The New Psycho Cybernetics - Maxwell Maltz - Audiobook mp3","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
