Derived from a course taught by the author, the textbook is designed to support both independent self-paced study and a traditional semester-long lecture. The book combines two complementary tracks. The theory part provides a detailed, incremental exposition of the physics of optical beam propagation, and a description of the relevant numerical techniques. The practice-track gives an opportunity to put the theory into use by guiding the reader through increasingly sophisticated examples, which cover program design and simulation execution as well as a critical assessment of the results. Written for a readership with modest experience in numerical simulations and programming, this textbook integrates both tracks into a story flowing in easy to digest increments, covering topics from the basics to the state of the art in the field","last_updated":"2018-07-07T12:04:04.096Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb8021b2b3e80ccd93c3d178e0dcb0f1c29bcb72","dn":"Computational Optics","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"cb8021b2b3e80ccd93c3d178e0dcb0f1c29bcb72","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,128,33,178,179,232,12,205,147,195,209,120,224,220,176,241,194,155,203,114]},"name":"Computational Optics","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
