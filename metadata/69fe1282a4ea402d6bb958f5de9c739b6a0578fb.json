Rob Thomas)and I dearly love &quot;The Game Of Love&quot; (feat. Michelle Branch).\r\n\r\nThere&apos;s nice standard Santana older songs like Oye como va and Black magic woman\r\non here too.\r\n\r\nIts better than the real &quot;hard&quot; rock and punk shit that&apos;s the stuff of seemingly\r\ninhuman-like appeal that is consumed so much of out in western countries instead.\r\n\r\nSantana&apos;s musical taste is certainly of superior european genius I figure,than whats around much of there rest of this planet too certainly, I believe - and he hasn&apos;t lost his touch in this regard by being elsewhere so long and being in the sun to the point of looking like a tourist in some western parts - its what is in his heart and soul that matters and his music is proof of that for the most part - and supremely so I believe. He is therefore a better man than are those seeking to tear down his image for not looking the part in the minds of all too many who cant come up with anything good in their minds instead by relative comparison of any merit whatever.\r\n\r\nThanks for seeding\r\n\r\nMichael Rizzo Chessman\r\n(musicfromrizzo)","last_updated":"2018-12-07T12:14:30.202Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:69fe1282a4ea402d6bb958f5de9c739b6a0578fb","dn":"Santana Ultimate Collection (2007) 320k CD (musicfromrizzo)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"69fe1282a4ea402d6bb958f5de9c739b6a0578fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,254,18,130,164,234,64,45,107,185,88,245,222,156,115,155,106,5,120,251]},"name":"Santana Ultimate Collection (2007) 320k CD (musicfromrizzo)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
