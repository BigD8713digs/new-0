Now a day&#x2019;s automation technology provides an integrated, flexible and low-cost system platform, it contains various elements that perform a wide variety of functions like controlling, monitoring, and supervising to the industrial processes.\r\nAutomation is composed of two Greek words Auto means self, Motos meansmoving, hence if a process of moving (any devices/machineries) is self directed is called as Automation. Industrial automation includes use of various self controlling devices (PLCs/PACs/PC etc.) to operate industrial process and machineries. The automation technology has become back bone of modern industries, because by using Automation technology not only the quality and quantity of products have been maximized, but also it reduces the labor cost, risk factor and manufacturing time.\r\n\r\nWho is the target audience?\r\n    Students who are pursuing or having Masters/ Bachelor&#x2019;s Degree /Diploma in EC/EE/EEE/EI Branches.\r\n    Working Professionals are also invited to join this course to enhance their knowledge in Industrial Automation.\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n    Students are supposed to be familiar with Desktop/Laptop.\r\n    No other prerequisites for this course, Because instructor will teach everything from scratch","last_updated":"2018-05-12T12:08:17.215Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:59b7acc31430ae8d35ec8b39f672a20922348f0b","dn":"Learn Allen Bradley Micrologix PLC Programming, From Scratch","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"59b7acc31430ae8d35ec8b39f672a20922348f0b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,183,172,195,20,48,174,141,53,236,139,57,246,114,162,9,34,52,143,11]},"name":"Learn Allen Bradley Micrologix PLC Programming, From Scratch","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
