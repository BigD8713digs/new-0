Spawned by earlier group The Id, the outfit is composed of co-founders Andy McCluskey (vocals, bass guitar) and Paul Humphreys (keyboards, vocals), along with Martin Cooper (various instruments) and Stuart Kershaw[3] (drums); McCluskey is the only constant member. OMD released their debut single, &quot;Electricity&quot;, in 1979, and gained popularity throughout Europe with the 1980 anti-war song &quot;Enola Gay&quot;. The band achieved broader recognition via their album Architecture &amp; Morality (1981).\r\nArchitecture &amp; Morality is their third studio album released on 8 November 1981 by Dindisc. Hailed as the band&apos;s seminal work, the album received critical acclaim and has appeared on various lists of the best albums; The Morning News named it the finest record of 1981, and &quot;the blueprint for synth-pop&quot;. The album also became a commercial success, selling over 4 million copies by 2007. The record spawned three international commercially successful singles, which together sold more than 8 million copies. \r\nThe bonus DVD is not included in this torrent.\r\n\r\nGenre: Synth-Pop\r\nYear of production: 2007\r\nDisc Manufacturer: UK\r\nLabel: Virgin/EMI\r\nAudio codec: FLAC\r\nRip type: image + CUE\r\nDuration: 61:22\r\n\r\nTracklist:\r\n01 &quot;The New Stone Age&quot; - 3:22 (McCluskey)\r\n02 &quot;She&apos;s Leaving&quot; - 3:28 (McCluskey / Humphreys)\r\n03 &quot;Souvenir&quot; - 3:39 (Humphreys / Cooper)\r\n04 &quot;Sealand&quot; - 7:47 (McCluskey / Humphreys)\r\n05 &quot;Joan of Arc&quot; - 3:48 (McCluskey)\r\n06 &quot;Joan of Arc (Maid of Orleans)&quot; - 4:12 (McCluskey)\r\n07 &quot;Architecture and Morality&quot; - 3:43 (McCluskey / Humphreys)\r\n08 &quot;Georgia&quot; - 3:24 (McCluskey / Humphreys)\r\n09 &quot;The Beginning and the End&quot; - 3:48 (McCluskey / Humphreys)\r\nRemastered Bonus\r\n10 &quot;Extended Souvenir&quot; - 4:16 (Humphreys / Cooper)\r\n11 &quot;Motion and Heart (Amazon Version)&quot; - 3:07 (McCluskey / Humphreys)\r\n12 &quot;Sacred Heart&quot; - 3:30 (McCluskey / Humphreys)\r\n13 &quot;The Romance of the Telescope (Unfinished)&quot; - 3:22 (McCluskey / Humphreys)\r\n14 &quot;Navigation&quot; - 3:00 (McCluskey / Humphreys)\r\n15 &quot;Of All The Things We&apos;ve Made&quot; - 3:25 (McCluskey / Humphreys)\r\n16 &quot;Gravity Never Failed&quot; - 3:24 (McCluskey / Humphreys)\r\n <a href=\"\nhttps://i.postimg.cc/xdf7c9Wt/1.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://i.postimg.cc/xdf7c9Wt/1.jpg</a> <a href=\"\nhttps://i.postimg.cc/JzqYw9GJ/2.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://i.postimg.cc/JzqYw9GJ/2.jpg</a>","last_updated":"2018-11-07T12:12:27.634Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b284f9e37e469041bf68d4aa3e89538153abcab","dn":"O.M.D. - Architecture and Morality (Remastered) (19812007) FLAC","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"5b284f9e37e469041bf68d4aa3e89538153abcab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,40,79,158,55,228,105,4,27,246,141,74,163,232,149,56,21,58,188,171]},"name":"O.M.D. - Architecture and Morality (Remastered) (19812007) FLAC","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
