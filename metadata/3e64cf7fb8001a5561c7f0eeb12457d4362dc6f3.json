Condemning &quot;urban&quot; vices like liquor, prostitution, movies, and jazz as Catholic and Jewish &quot;plots&quot; to subvert American values, the rejuvenated Klan became entirely mainstream, attracting middle-class men and women through its elaborate secret rituals and mass &quot;Klonvocations&quot; before collapsing amid revelations of sordid sexual scandals, financial embezzlement, and Ponzi-like schemes. The Klan&apos;s brilliant melding of Christian values with racial bigotry and its lightning-like accretion of political power now becomes a sobering parable for the 21st century.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-12-13T12:00:45.505Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e64cf7fb8001a5561c7f0eeb12457d4362dc6f3","dn":"The Second Coming of the KKK by Linda Gordon MOBI","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"3e64cf7fb8001a5561c7f0eeb12457d4362dc6f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,100,207,127,184,0,26,85,97,199,240,238,177,36,87,212,54,45,198,243]},"name":"The Second Coming of the KKK by Linda Gordon MOBI","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
