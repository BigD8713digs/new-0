Photos she doesn&apos;t remember posing for. She can&apos;t recall much about that night during a work conference - she&apos;d written off her headache the next morning as the result of too much drinking at the hotel bar. But then increasingly disturbing photos start appearing in her email, along with bills and other items she can&apos;t account for. As the blackmailer grows bolder and events start to escalate beyond her control, Gemma fears for her already shaky marriage and worries that the truth of what really happened that night must be more twisted than she imagines.\r\n\r\nUnable to go to the police for fear that she will lose her family, Gemma resolves to hunt down the blackmailer on her own. But not everyone in Gemma&apos;s life is who they seem, and as she gets closer to the truth, she discovers just how far the shadows from her past can reach.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-04-26T12:04:50.834Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:f04cafad09ea5910d72f461501b284a5972198f3","dn":"The Girl I Used to Be by Mary Torjussen EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"f04cafad09ea5910d72f461501b284a5972198f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,76,175,173,9,234,89,16,215,47,70,21,1,178,132,165,151,33,152,243]},"name":"The Girl I Used to Be by Mary Torjussen EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
