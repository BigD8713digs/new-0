Rausing. The couple had struggled with drug addiction for years, often under the glare of tabloid headlines. Now, writing with singular clarity and restraint, Hans&apos; sister, the editor and publisher Sigrid Rausing, tries to make sense of what happened.\r\n\r\nIn Mayhem, she asks the difficult questions those close to the world of addiction must face. &quot;Who can help the addict, consumed by a shaming hunger, a need beyond control? There is no medicine: the drugs are the medicine. And who can help their families, so implicated in the self-destruction of the addict? Who can help when the very notion of &apos;help&apos; becomes synonymous with an exercise of power; a familial police state; an end to freedom, in the addict&apos;s mind?&quot;\r\n\r\nAn eloquent and timely attempt to understand the conundrum of addiction - and a memoir as devastating as it is riveting.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-09-05T12:00:28.214Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:23b89e8ec7775498cf1585327567f95ccbdcb683","dn":"Mayhem_ A Memoir by Sigrid Rausing ePUB eBOOK-ZAK","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"23b89e8ec7775498cf1585327567f95ccbdcb683","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,184,158,142,199,119,84,152,207,21,133,50,117,103,249,92,203,220,182,131]},"name":"Mayhem_ A Memoir by Sigrid Rausing ePUB eBOOK-ZAK","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
