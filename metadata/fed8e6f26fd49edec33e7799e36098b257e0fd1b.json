The Litter formed in 1966 in Minneapolis, Minnesota. \r\nThe group recorded three albums in the late 1960s before disbanding. \r\nAll of their Minneapolis recorded material was produced by Warren Kendrick, who owned the Scotty and Warick and Hexagon labels.One of Minneapolis&#x2019; most popular &#x2019;60s bands, the Litter are most well-known for their classic 1967 garage rock single &#x201C;Action Woman.&#x201D; With its demonic fuzz/feedback guitar riffs and cocky, snarling lead vocal, it was an archetype of the tough &#x2019;60s garage rock favored by fans of the Pebbles reissue series. In fact, the single, which got some airplay in Minnesota in early 1967 and then was largely forgotten, didn&#x2019;t reach an international audience until it became cut one, Side One on Volume One of Pebbles in the late &#x2019;70s. It now has a place of honor on the Nuggets box set. The Litter were a little more successful and long-lived than the average regional garage band, recording a few albums, the last one for a major label, and evolving into a more progressive hard rock outfit before disbanding around the end of the &#x2019;60s. \r\n\r\nTracklist: \r\n01 - End of the Tape.flac \r\n02 - A Lost Art.flac \r\n03 - Trek of the Mongoloids.flac \r\n04 - Today.flac \r\n05 - Cross-Over.flac \r\n06 - O-Zone.flac \r\n07 - Crazy Horse.flac \r\n08 - Space a Comin&apos;.flac \r\n09 - Puff the Magic Dragon.flac \r\n10 - For Saddest Clowns.flac \r\n11 - Space a Comin&apos; (Version 2).flac \r\n12 - Puff the Magic Dragon (Version 2).flac \r\n13 - Ungrateful Peg (Live).flac \r\n\r\nSummary: \r\nCountry: USA \r\nGenre: garage, psychedelic rock","last_updated":"2018-10-07T12:51:07.760Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:fed8e6f26fd49edec33e7799e36098b257e0fd1b","dn":"[garage, psychedelic rock] (2018) The Litter - Wretch ","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"fed8e6f26fd49edec33e7799e36098b257e0fd1b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,216,230,242,111,212,158,222,195,62,119,153,227,96,152,178,87,224,253,27]},"name":"[garage, psychedelic rock] (2018) The Litter - Wretch ","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
