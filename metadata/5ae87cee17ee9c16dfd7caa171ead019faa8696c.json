To love something is to observe it with more than usual attention, and that is precisely what Smiley does in this irresistibly smart, witty, and engaging chronicle of her obsession. In particular she follows a sexy filly named Waterwheel and a grey named Wowie (he &quot;tells&quot; a horse communicator that he wants it changed from Hornblower) as they begin careers at the racetrack. Filled with humor and suspense, and with discourses on equine intelligence, affection, and character, A Year at the Races is a winner.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-09-20T12:05:04.216Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ae87cee17ee9c16dfd7caa171ead019faa8696c","dn":"A Year at the Races_ Reflections on Horses, Humans, Love, Money ","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"5ae87cee17ee9c16dfd7caa171ead019faa8696c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,232,124,238,23,238,156,22,223,215,202,161,113,234,208,25,250,168,105,108]},"name":"A Year at the Races_ Reflections on Horses, Humans, Love, Money ","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
