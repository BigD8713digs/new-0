This thoroughly revised edition, first published to acclaim and some controversy in 2005 as Steal This Vote, reveals why America is unique among established Western democracies in its inability to run clean, transparent elections. And it demonstrates, in crisp, clear, accessible language, how the partisan battles now raging over voter ID, out-of-control campaign spending, and minority voting rights fit into a long, largely unspoken tradition of hostility to the very notion of representative democracy.\r\n\r\nDown for the Count is a multifaceted, deeply researched, and engaging critical assessment of a system whose ostensible commitment to democratic integrity often falls apart on contact with race, money, and power. In an age of high-stakes electoral combat, billionaire-backed candidacies, and bottom-of-the-barrel campaigning, there can be no better time to read this troubling and revealing book.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-12-03T12:00:38.580Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:522148b18df24f2b076f3c5f61884280f200b49b","dn":"Down for the Count by Andrew Gumbel PDF","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"522148b18df24f2b076f3c5f61884280f200b49b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,33,72,177,141,242,79,43,7,111,60,95,97,136,66,128,242,0,180,155]},"name":"Down for the Count by Andrew Gumbel PDF","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
