All good questions, and if you want the answers, this book will help you find them. Recently, ISIS has taken parts of Syria and Iraq for the new Caliphate, and people in the non-Muslim world struggle to understand. This book explains the background history to so much of what is happening and surveys the possibilities for the future. Islam is exposed as a religion very different from any other religion, especially Christianity, throughout history, as well as its manifestation in our present. All through history and even today, the West has been looking for moderate Muslims to stand up against the radicalism of the Islamic Fundamentalists. Here finally, the simple truth is revealed that &#x201C;Islam is Islam.&#x201D; The distinction between radical and moderate is usually more imagined than real. The authors&#x2019; unique qualifications as students of history and the residency in Cyprus of one of the authors provide a unique perspective not likely to be found elsewhere\r\n\r\nPlease seed.
