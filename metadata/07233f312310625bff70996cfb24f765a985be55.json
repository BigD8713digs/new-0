Four were condemned to death; two were executed.\r\n\r\nThis engrossing book reveals the extraordinary methods adopted by MI5 to uncover British traitors and their German spymasters, as well as two serious wartime plots by well-connected British fascists to mount a coup d&#x2019;etat which would replace the government with an authoritarian pro-Nazi regime.\r\n\r\nThe book also shows how archaic attitudes to social status and gender in Whitehall and the courts ensured that justice was neither fair nor equitable. Aristocratic British pro-Nazi sympathizers and collaborators were frequently protected while the less-privileged foot soldiers of the Fifth Column were interned, jailed or even executed for identical crimes.\r\n\r\nHardcover: 384 pages\r\nPublisher: Icon Books Ltd (6 Sept. 2018)","last_updated":"2018-09-24T12:27:33.324Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:07233f312310625bff70996cfb24f765a985be55","dn":"Hitler's British Traitors: The Secret History of Spies, ...","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"07233f312310625bff70996cfb24f765a985be55","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,35,63,49,35,16,98,91,255,112,153,108,251,36,247,101,169,133,190,85]},"name":"Hitler's British Traitors: The Secret History of Spies, ...","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
