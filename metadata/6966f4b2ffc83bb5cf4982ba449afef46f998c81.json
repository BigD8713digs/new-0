You have body to control. But really special feature is that you can make your own animations which aren&apos;t just visual like in almost all other games, but 100% physics based, so they define how you move through the environment.  Animating is relatively easy, you can make good animation in a minute, then assign it to a button and you can use it in current level or any level you wish! However, there are also default animations from beginning.GenreCybermotion is 2D","last_updated":"2017-12-11T12:08:21.173Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:6966f4b2ffc83bb5cf4982ba449afef46f998c81","dn":"Cybermotion v0.13","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"6966f4b2ffc83bb5cf4982ba449afef46f998c81","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,102,244,178,255,200,59,181,207,73,130,186,68,154,254,244,111,153,140,129]},"name":"Cybermotion v0.13","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
