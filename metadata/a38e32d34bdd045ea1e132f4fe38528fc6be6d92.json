It stars Christopher George, Andrew Prine and Richard Jaeckel. Widely considered a Jaws rip-off, Grizzly used many of the same plot devices as its shark predecessor, which had been a huge box-office success during the previous year. The giant grizzly bear in the film was portrayed by a bear named Teddy, who was 11 feet tall","last_updated":"2017-07-13T12:04:25.550Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:a38e32d34bdd045ea1e132f4fe38528fc6be6d92","dn":"Grizzly rifftrax optimized.mp4","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"a38e32d34bdd045ea1e132f4fe38528fc6be6d92","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,142,50,211,75,221,4,94,161,225,50,244,254,56,82,143,198,190,109,146]},"name":"Grizzly rifftrax optimized.mp4","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
