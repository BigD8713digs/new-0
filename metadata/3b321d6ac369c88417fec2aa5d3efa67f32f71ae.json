In The Alps, Stephen O&apos;Shea takes readers up and down these majestic mountains, journeying through their 500-mile arc across France, Italy, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Germany, Austria, and Slovenia. Along the way he explores the reality behind Hannibal and his elephants&apos; famous crossing in 218 BCE; he reveals how the Alps have profoundly influenced culture, from Frankenstein to Heidi to The Sound of Music; and he visits the spot where Arthur Conan Doyle staged Sherlock Holmes&apos; death scene, the bloody site of the Italians&apos; retreat in World War I, and Hitler&apos;s notorious vacation house, the Eagle&apos;s Nest. Throughout, O&apos;Shea records his adventures with the watchmakers, salt miners, cable-car operators, and yodelers who define the Alps today.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-07-01T12:14:48.048Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b321d6ac369c88417fec2aa5d3efa67f32f71ae","dn":"The Alps by Stephen O'Shea EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"3b321d6ac369c88417fec2aa5d3efa67f32f71ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,50,29,106,195,105,200,132,23,254,194,170,93,62,250,103,243,47,113,174]},"name":"The Alps by Stephen O'Shea EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
