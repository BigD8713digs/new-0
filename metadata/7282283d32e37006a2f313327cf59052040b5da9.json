Then based in the bayside college town of Bellingham, Washington, Gibbard had a minor breakthrough in 1997 with his debut cassette, You Can Play These Songs with Chords, prompting him to put together a band that included the cassette&apos;s producer, Chris Walla. After marrying grungy rock and bittersweet indie pop for nearly a decade, their 2005 major-label debut, the more polished Plans, propelled Death Cab for Cutie into the Top Five behind the Hot 100 single &quot;Soul Meets Body.&quot; They followed it with another hit song, the ballad &quot;I Will Possess Your Heart&quot; from 2008&apos;s Narrow Stairs, which went all the way to number one on the Billboard 200. Both of those records were also nominated for Grammy Awards for Best Alternative Music Album. Continuing a trend toward more refined production, they returned to the Top Ten with releases such as 2011&apos;s Codes and Keys (another Grammy nominee for Best Alternative Music Album) and 2015&apos;s Kintsugi.  Guitarist/keyboardists Dave Depper and Zac Rae joined the group to tour in support of the album, and became official members for the recording of Thank You for Today. Released in August 2018, it welcomed Costey back as producer","last_updated":"2018-08-17T12:09:46.772Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:7282283d32e37006a2f313327cf59052040b5da9","dn":"Death Cab for Cutie - Thank You for Today (2018) [16.44 FLAC]","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"7282283d32e37006a2f313327cf59052040b5da9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,130,40,61,50,227,112,6,162,243,19,50,124,245,144,82,4,11,93,169]},"name":"Death Cab for Cutie - Thank You for Today (2018) [16.44 FLAC]","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
