The game was developed by Argonaut Games and published by Virgin Interactive. The game was later ported to the Philips CD-i, Sega Saturn and PlayStation video game systems.[3]\n\nThe title was one of the first extensive CD-ROM titles and used full-motion video for both cutscene and interactive portions. As a result, the game spans over a gigabyte in size and over two discs. Gameplay is divided into two portions: an on-rails shoot &apos;em up portion in which the player pilots a ship through various pre-rendered environments and an adventure-style first-person action portion where players chose between track-based paths at various nodes","last_updated":"2018-10-13T12:14:14.342Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:814720a02e6d73380d38fe8fa75461ecded5b547","dn":"Creature Shock 1994","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"814720a02e6d73380d38fe8fa75461ecded5b547","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,71,32,160,46,109,115,56,13,56,254,143,167,84,97,236,222,213,181,71]},"name":"Creature Shock 1994","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
