I takes an interdisciplinary approach that is both balanced and practical with six major foci: the history of biblical interpretation, philosophical presuppositions, biblical genre, the uniqueness of Scripture, the practice of exegesis, and use of exegetical insights that will be lived and communicated in preaching and teaching.\r\n\r\n\r\nBiblical Hermeneutics is designed for students who have little or no knowledge of biblical interpretation. It provides, in one volume, resources for gaining a working knowledge of the multi-faceted nature of biblical interpretation and for supporting the practice of exegesis on the part of the student. The first chapter &quot;A Student&apos;s Primer for Exegesis&quot; by Bruce Corley gives the student a bird&apos;s eye view of the entire process. It becomes for the student a kind of template to which they will return again and again as they engage in the process of exegesis.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis revised edition of Biblical Hermeneutics contains seven new chapter that deal with the major literary genre of Scripture: law, narrative, poetry, wisdom, prophecy, Gospels and Acts, epistles, and apocalyptic. The unique nature of Scripture is presented in part three that addresses the authority, inspiration, and language of Scripture. The book contains two extensive appendices, &quot;A Student&apos;s Glossary for Biblical Studies&quot; and an updated and expanded version of &quot;A Student&apos;s Guide to Reference Books and Biblical Commentaries.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease seed.
