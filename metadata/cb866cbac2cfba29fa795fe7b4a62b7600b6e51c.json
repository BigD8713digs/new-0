Ray \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMany of us experience life through so many conceptual filters that we never recognize the freedom and joy that are inherent in us&#x2014;and are in fact the essence of who we are. We can grow old not realizing that one of the most powerful tools to escape the painful knots we tie ourselves in is, literally, at our fingertips: our body.Here, Reggie Ray cracks open the shell of the mind-body dichotomy and presents six fundamental body-based practices that connect us back to who we really are. These practices cut through the mental fabrications through which we experience our world and lead us directly to the richness of living a fully present, embodied human life.Includes a link to free downloads of recorded guided practices","last_updated":"2018-09-08T12:30:54.724Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb866cbac2cfba29fa795fe7b4a62b7600b6e51c","dn":"The Awakening Body.epub","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"cb866cbac2cfba29fa795fe7b4a62b7600b6e51c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,134,108,186,194,207,186,41,250,121,95,231,180,166,43,118,0,182,229,28]},"name":"The Awakening Body.epub","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
