An Arab American with a conflicted past, he is now in Turkey, attempting to cross into Syria and join the fight against Bashar al-Assad&apos;s regime. But he is robbed before he can make it, and is taken in by Amir, a charismatic Syrian refugee and former revolutionary, and Amir&apos;s wife, Daphne, a sophisticated beauty haunted by grief. As it becomes clear that Daphne is also desperate to return to Syria, Haris&apos;s choices become ever more wrenching: Whose side is he really on? Is he a true radical or simply an idealist? And will he be able to bring meaning to a life of increasing frustration and helplessness? Told with compassion and a deft hand, Dark at the Crossing is an exploration of loss, of second chances, and of why we choose to believe - a trenchantly observed novel of raw urgency and power.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-01-01T12:06:07.709Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:edc4674bcd158a5e834565cf96341483a55ea46c","dn":"Dark at the Crossing by Elliot Ackerman MOBI","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"edc4674bcd158a5e834565cf96341483a55ea46c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,196,103,75,205,21,138,94,131,69,101,207,150,52,20,131,165,94,164,108]},"name":"Dark at the Crossing by Elliot Ackerman MOBI","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
