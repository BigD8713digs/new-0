Madson (Elsevier, 2016).pdf\r\n\r\nMass Spectrometry: Techniques for the Structural Characterization of Glycans presents new methods for conducting detailed carbohydrate qualitative analysis&#x2014;arming analytical chemists, pharmaceutical scientists, and food scientists with a quick reference that will allow them to determine the structures of carbohydrates molecules.\r\n\r\nAs there is a need in the scientific community for content specific to structural determination and analysis of new glycoprotein drug, and because structure-activity analysis requires a structural determination of the N- and O-linked oligosaccharides linked to glycol-proteins, this book provides the relevant research that are necessary for advances and new outcomes in this area of study.\r\n\r\nAuthored by an analytical chemist with more than 30 years of experience in research and industry\r\nServes as a quick reference in mass spectral analysis and carbohydrates\r\nIncludes more than 60 figures to aid in the retention of key concepts","last_updated":"2017-06-08T12:05:11.122Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:425452996fb9317c33dc5b09b5bf868cd080e24a","dn":"Mass Spectrometry Techniques for Structural Characterization of ","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"425452996fb9317c33dc5b09b5bf868cd080e24a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,84,82,153,111,185,49,124,51,220,91,9,181,191,134,140,208,128,226,74]},"name":"Mass Spectrometry Techniques for Structural Characterization of ","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
