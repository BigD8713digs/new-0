A beautiful island in the middle of Lake Ontario - a self-sustaining community made up of people who want to live without fear, crime, or greed. Halcyon is run by Valerie Kemp, aka Mother Moon, benevolent and altruistic on the outside, but hiding an unimaginable darkness inside. She has dedicated her life to the pursuit of Glam Moon, a place of eternal beauty and healing. And she believes the pathway there can only be found at the end of pleasure.\r\n\r\nOn the heels of tragedy, Martin Lovegrove moves his family to Halcyon. A couple of months, he tells himself, to retreat from the chaos and grind. He soon begins to suspect there is something beneath Halcyon&#x2019;s perfect veneer and sets out to discover the truth - however terrible it might be - behind the island and its mysterious founder, Mother Moon.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-07-11T12:02:18.791Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:e2f28411a92716d096777302f615cb6684504f31","dn":"Halcyon: A Thriller by Rio Youers EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"e2f28411a92716d096777302f615cb6684504f31","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,242,132,17,169,39,22,208,150,119,115,2,246,21,203,102,132,80,79,49]},"name":"Halcyon: A Thriller by Rio Youers EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
