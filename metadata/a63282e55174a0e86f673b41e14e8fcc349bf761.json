A few years back, he investigated the corrupt-and as it turned out, homicidal-local school board, and now the town&apos;s back in view with more alarming news: A woman&apos;s been found dead, frozen in a block of ice. There&apos;s a possibility that it might be connected to a high school class of twenty years ago that has a mid-winter reunion coming up, and so, wrapping his coat a little tighter, Virgil begins to dig into twenty years&apos; worth of traumas, feuds, and bad blood. In the process, one thing becomes increasingly clear to him. It&apos;s true what they say: High school is murder.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-11-08T12:17:22.304Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:a63282e55174a0e86f673b41e14e8fcc349bf761","dn":"Deep Freeze by John Sandford EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"a63282e55174a0e86f673b41e14e8fcc349bf761","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,50,130,229,81,116,160,232,111,103,59,65,225,78,143,204,52,155,247,97]},"name":"Deep Freeze by John Sandford EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
