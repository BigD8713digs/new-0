This performance covers all the bases, from the raw simplicity of &quot;You Really Got Me&quot; and &quot;All Day And All Of The Night&quot; to the deep introspective beauty of Waterloo Sunset.&quot; Healthy doses of the recent material from &quot;Schoolboys In Disgrace&quot; and &quot;Sleepwalker&quot; are met with approval and the band rocks harder than ever.\r\n\r\nThose who love the band&apos;s comeback era will find no better live example of that material than this performance. It is also surprising just how brightly some of the bands early 1970s material actually shines. &quot;Celluloid Heroes&quot; is a perfect example of this. Older fans will be delighted to find &quot;A Well Respected Man,&quot; sing-a-long renditions of &quot;Sunny Afternoon&quot; and &quot;Lola&quot; and a full tilt &quot;Victoria&quot; to end the night.\r\n\r\nThe Kinks live Winterland, San Francisco 1977.02.19\r\n01 - You Really Got Me (Intro)\r\n02 - One Of The Survivors\r\n03 - Sleepwalker\r\n04 - Rush Hour Blues\r\n05 - You Make It All Worthwhile/Ordinary People/Everybody&apos;s A Star\r\n06 &#x2013; Lola(singalong)/Banana Boat Song\r\n07 - A Well Respected Man\r\n08 - Sunny Afternoon\r\n09 - Waterloo Sunset\r\n10 - Celluloid Heroes\r\n11 - Schooldays\r\n12 - Schooldays(reprise)/The Hard Way\r\n13 - Education\r\n14 - Brother\r\n15 - Stormy Sky\r\n16 - Life Goes On\r\n17 - Full Moon\r\n18 - Lola\r\n19 - Alcohol\r\n20 - You Really Got Me/All Day All Of the Night\r\n21 - Life On the Road\r\n22 &#x2013; Victoria\r\n\r\nTotal Time = 112:45\r\n\r\nRay Davies - guitar, vocals\r\nDave Davies - lead guitar, vocals\r\nAndy Pyle - bass\r\nJohn Gosling - piano, keyboards\r\nMick Avory - drums\r\nNick Newell - sax\r\nDebbie Doss - background vocals\r\nShirley Roden - background vocals","last_updated":"2018-10-25T13:46:36.236Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:384cbe7c1f07186bf8778d2f929ad1249edb2db5","dn":"The Kinks Winterland 1977 Pre-FM Recording Master Reel FLAC","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"384cbe7c1f07186bf8778d2f929ad1249edb2db5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,76,190,124,31,7,24,107,248,119,141,47,146,154,209,36,158,219,45,181]},"name":"The Kinks Winterland 1977 Pre-FM Recording Master Reel FLAC","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
