The author, a U.S. Army Green Beret, often travels to foreign countries on short notice and needs to be able to communicate with military and government officials, many of who do not speak English. He tried all types of schools, classes, books and tapes, but none delivered what he needed when he needed it. So he developed his own method for learning foreign languages. It proved so effective for him and his fellow Green Berets that he decided to share his method with others who need to learn a language quickly. The Quick and Dirty Guide to Learning Languages Fast is designed for people who have no interest in learning complicated rules of grammar. The author promises that his method will help anyone become functional in any language in seven days and proficient in 30. He&apos;s trimmed the fat, freeing your time for what&apos;s truly useful. Includes a day-by-day schedule, a handy workbook format and secret tips to help you master key elements quickly and easily.\r\n <a href=\"\nhttps://worldimages.gallery/images/2017/07/03/img.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://worldimages.gallery/images/2017/07/03/img.gif</a>","last_updated":"2017-11-08T13:25:56.303Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:eede558d4d5d0a70df1b832ed9a0bd2349ad8f81","dn":"A.
