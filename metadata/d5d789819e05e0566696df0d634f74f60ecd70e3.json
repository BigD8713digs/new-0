What&apos;s worse, the man has a gun locked in the trunk - and it has recently been fired.\r\n\r\nThe next day Stride learns that a Duluth college student has vanished and worries that the two incidents are related. But what would have put an ordinary young woman in the crosshairs of a man who has all the hallmarks of an assassin for hire?\r\n\r\nStride&apos;s investigation of the girl&apos;s disappearance leads him onto the set of a film crew in Duluth, where a movie based on a case from his own past is being made. The actor playing Stride is Hollywood royalty, an award-winning icon who has charmed his way to the top of the box office.\r\n\r\nBut Stride soon hears whispers that his alter ego has a dark side and, in trying to expose the truth, discovers that he has made a powerful enemy who will stop at nothing to protect his reputation.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-05-03T12:13:39.443Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:d5d789819e05e0566696df0d634f74f60ecd70e3","dn":"Alter Ego by Brian Freeman EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"d5d789819e05e0566696df0d634f74f60ecd70e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,215,137,129,158,5,224,86,102,150,223,13,99,79,116,246,14,205,112,227]},"name":"Alter Ego by Brian Freeman EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
