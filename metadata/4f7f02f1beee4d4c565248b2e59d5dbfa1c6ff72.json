Instead of being executed, Lev and Kolya are given a shot at saving their own lives by complying with an outrageous directive: secure a dozen eggs for a powerful Soviet colonel to use in his daughter&apos;s wedding cake. In a city cut off from all supplies and suffering unbelievable deprivation, Lev and Kolya embark on a hunt through the dire lawlessness of Leningrad and behind enemy lines to find the impossible.\r\n\r\nBy turns insightful and funny, thrilling and terrifying, City of Thieves is a gripping, cinematic World War II adventure and an intimate coming-of-age story with an utterly contemporary feel for how boys become men","last_updated":"2017-04-26T09:14:43.283Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f7f02f1beee4d4c565248b2e59d5dbfa1c6ff72","dn":"CITY OF THIEVES - David Benioff.
