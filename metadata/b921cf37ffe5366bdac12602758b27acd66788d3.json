The product uses the most advanced technologies in its work, for example, Metropolis Light Transport or Spectral light calculus, as well as many others, names that do not tell me personally, but I think it&apos;s cool. \r\nAll the technologies presented are aimed at the fact that in the end you will get the most realistic image. The developers write that this rendering can achieve an excellent result, which is often required from architects and when working with object visualization. \r\nIndigo Renderer differs from other renderers in that all calculations of both light and energy, caustics and others can occur interdependently. Note that, for example, lighting calculations will be based on the laws of physics. The interface does not have Russian localization, but it seems to me that if a person needs this program, then he can calmly deal with its capabilities, and as you understand quite a lot of them. \r\n\r\nDeveloper: Glare Technologies Limited \r\nLicense: ShareWare \r\nLanguage: English \r\nSize: 149.43 + 122.44 MB \r\nOS: Windows x64 \r\n\r\nHow to Install: \r\n1).
