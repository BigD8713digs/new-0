Marisa Lankester, a young beauty with a privileged New York upbringing, stumbles into the back door of the largest illegal sports betting organization in the US, run by Ron (The Cigar) Sacco. Marisa, a thrill-seeker, maneuvers herself into this mob-run men-only bookmaking operation, and with her looks and brains, becomes a trusted insider. Along the way, Marisa falls in love with Sacco&apos;s business partner, the charismatic Tony. In an attempt to evade the wrath of the FBI, Marisa and Tony relocate Sacco&apos;s operation from Los Angeles, first to Las Vegas, and then to the Dominican Republic where gambling is legal. What begins as a fun and exciting ride on the Caribbean island, where the tall, blonde beauty also becomes a top model, morphs into a twisted nightmare. It is also the romantic tale of a beautiful, smart young woman whose love for a charismatic and handsome Italian-American leads her down the road into crime, incarceration, and rape.\r\n\r\nDangerous Odds is the ultimate suspenseful mystery-thriller that draws the reader into the adrenaline-pumping world of sports gambling and betting.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-03-24T12:02:16.100Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:78950d370cf4196636014139b68239c9b84c6da2","dn":"Dangerous Odds by Marisa Lankester EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"78950d370cf4196636014139b68239c9b84c6da2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,149,13,55,12,244,25,102,54,1,65,57,182,130,57,201,184,76,109,162]},"name":"Dangerous Odds by Marisa Lankester EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
