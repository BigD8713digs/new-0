A defenseless homeless man has been burned to death by three teenagers with gang ties. The suspects are already in custody, and the evidence is overwhelming - but when one suspect&#x2019;s brother is targeted for murder, Danny starts to think there may be more to this seemingly clear-cut case. Obsessed with discovering the true identity of the victim, a gentle vagrant who may have been hiding a tortured past, Danny and his team start to uncover a high-reaching conspiracy that puts them all at risk - and threatens to open new wounds that could cut even deeper than Danny&#x2019;s old ones.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-07-21T12:00:41.752Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:53c6fb9288203b97c5a7d50cb1997611acd1b6c5","dn":"A Cold and Broken Hallelujah (Long Beach Homicide series_book 3)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"53c6fb9288203b97c5a7d50cb1997611acd1b6c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,198,251,146,136,32,59,151,197,167,213,12,177,153,118,17,172,209,182,197]},"name":"A Cold and Broken Hallelujah (Long Beach Homicide series_book 3)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
