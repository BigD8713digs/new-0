In this exquisitely tense narrative reimagining of Edward Hopper&apos;s Eleven A.M., 1926, the reader enters the minds of both the woman and her married lover, each consumed by alternating thoughts of disgust and arousal, as he rushes, amorously, murderously, to her door. \r\n\r\nIn &quot;The Long-Legged Girl&quot;, an aging, jealous wife crafts an unusual game of Russian roulette involving a pair of Wedgwood teacups, a strong Bengal brew, and a lethal concoction of medicine. Who will drink from the wrong cup, the wife or the dance student she believes to be her husband&apos;s latest conquest? \r\n\r\nIn &quot;The Sign of the Beast&quot;, when a former Sunday school teacher&apos;s corpse turns up, the blighted adolescent she had by turns petted and ridiculed confesses to her murder - but is he really responsible? Another young outsider, Horace Phineas Love Jr., is haunted by apparitions at the very edge of the spectrum of visibility after the death of his tortured father in &quot;Night-Gaunts&quot;, a fantastic ode to H. P. Lovecraft.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-06-07T12:00:58.277Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:a28cae7c5259171b47e30de94e78e5a288b28a20","dn":"Night-Gaunts and Other Tales .. by Joyce Carol Oates EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"a28cae7c5259171b47e30de94e78e5a288b28a20","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,140,174,124,82,89,23,27,71,227,13,233,78,120,229,162,136,178,138,32]},"name":"Night-Gaunts and Other Tales .. by Joyce Carol Oates EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
