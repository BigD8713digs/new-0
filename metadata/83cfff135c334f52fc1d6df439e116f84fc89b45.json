THE BEST OF THE SONGBOOKS: THE BALLADS is one of the many compilations based on these recordings, and one of the best.\r\nFrom its beautiful, informative packaging to its gorgeously remastered sound, this 16-track, 64-minute collection treats the material with the respect it deserves. The material, of course, is first-rate, wall-to-wall standards from Johnny Mercer&apos;s wistful &quot;Laura&quot; to Ellington&apos;s sly &quot;Do Nothin&apos; Til You Hear From Me.&quot; \r\nFitzgerald&apos;s performances are equally outstanding, as are the mostly big-band arrangements. This is as good as jazz ballad collections get. (AMG)\r\n\r\n <a href=\"\nhttps://i.imgur.com/94OAxVz.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://i.imgur.com/94OAxVz.jpg</a>\r\n\r\n\r\n01.
