As her story unfolds, Callie reluctantly becomes involved with the &quot;guests&quot; at Sea Pines: other Young women struggling with problems of their own. Although their &quot;issues&quot; are different from hers, Callie is drawn into the group, finds her voice, and, gradually, confronts the family trauma that triggered her destructive behavior. \r\n\r\nCut is a compelling and compassionate look at a young woman&apos;s struggle to overcome the impulses that led her to inflict harm on herself. \r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-11-30T12:00:39.742Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e0feb43f21b8100d540fd9021af32b64629fde4","dn":" Patricia McCormick EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"8e0feb43f21b8100d540fd9021af32b64629fde4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,15,235,67,242,27,129,0,213,64,253,144,33,175,50,182,70,41,253,228]},"name":" Patricia McCormick EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
