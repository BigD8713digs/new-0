The true history of the soldiers, sailors, airmen and civilians involved in the nine-day skirmish has passed into legend. Now the story Winston Churchill described as a &apos;miracle&apos; is narrated by best-selling author Joshua Levine in its full sweeping context, including new interviews with veterans and survivors.\r\n\r\nTold from the viewpoints of land, sea and air, Joshua Levine&apos;s Dunkirk is a dramatic account of a defeat that paved the way to ultimate victory and preserved liberty for generations to come.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-08-07T12:01:39.074Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:8794a596a27e26387de953a90f62070480208d51","dn":"Dunkirk_ The History Behind the Major Motion Picture by Joshua L","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"8794a596a27e26387de953a90f62070480208d51","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,148,165,150,162,126,38,56,125,233,83,169,15,98,7,4,128,32,141,81]},"name":"Dunkirk_ The History Behind the Major Motion Picture by Joshua L","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
