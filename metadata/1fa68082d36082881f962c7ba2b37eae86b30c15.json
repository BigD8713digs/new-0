Written with exacting and scrupulous scholarship, it was designed both to command the respect of educators and to capture the interest of the layman.\r\n\r\nDurant lucidly describes the philosophical systems of such world-famous &#x201C;monarchs of the mind&#x201D; as Plato, Aristotle, Francis Bacon, Spinoza, Kant, Voltaire, and Nietzsche. Along with their ideas, he offers their flesh-and-blood biographies, placing their thoughts within their own time and place and elucidating their influence on our modern intellectual heritage. This book is packed with wisdom and wit.\r\n\r\nWill Durant (1885-1981) was awarded the Pulitzer Prize and the Presidential Medal of Freedom. He spent over 50 years writing his critically acclaimed 11-volume series The Story of Civilization. A champion of human-rights issues such as social reform and the brotherhood of man long before they were popular, he continues to educate and entertain readers worldwide through his writings.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-10-16T12:01:42.965Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:1fa68082d36082881f962c7ba2b37eae86b30c15","dn":"The Story of Philosophy by Will Durant EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"1fa68082d36082881f962c7ba2b37eae86b30c15","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,166,128,130,211,96,130,136,31,150,44,123,162,179,126,174,134,179,12,21]},"name":"The Story of Philosophy by Will Durant EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
