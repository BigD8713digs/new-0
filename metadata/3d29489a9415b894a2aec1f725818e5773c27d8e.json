Steven Johnson argues that throughout history, the cutting edge of innovation has lain wherever people have been working the hardest to keep themselves and others amused.\r\n\r\nJohnson&apos;s storytelling is just as delightful as the inventions he describes, full of surprising stops along the journey, from simple concepts to complex modern systems. He introduces us to the colorful innovators of leisure: the explorers, proprietors, showmen, and artists who changed the trajectory of history with their luxurious wares, exotic meals, taverns, gambling tables, and magic shows.\r\n\r\nJohnson compellingly argues that observers of technological and social trends should be looking for clues in novel amusements. You&apos;ll find the future wherever people are having the most fun","last_updated":"2017-06-10T12:00:53.606Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d29489a9415b894a2aec1f725818e5773c27d8e","dn":"Steven Johnson - Wonderland 2016 RETAiL ePUB eBOOK-DiSTRiBUTiON","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"3d29489a9415b894a2aec1f725818e5773c27d8e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,41,72,154,148,21,184,148,162,174,193,247,37,129,142,87,115,194,125,142]},"name":"Steven Johnson - Wonderland 2016 RETAiL ePUB eBOOK-DiSTRiBUTiON","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
