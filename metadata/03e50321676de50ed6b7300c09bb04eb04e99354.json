And when you are shown the small infant in the nursery, a terrible thought takes root: this baby is not your baby.\r\n\r\nNo one believes you. Not the nurses, your father or even your own husband. They say you&#x2019;re confused and delusional. Dangerous.\r\n\r\nBut you&#x2019;re a doctor - you know how easily mistakes can be made. It&#x2019;s up to you to find your real child, your miracle baby, before it&#x2019;s too late.\r\n\r\nWith everyone against you, is it safe to trust your instincts? Or are memories from your past clouding your judgement? This can&#x2019;t all be in your head...can it?\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-04-10T17:30:27.489Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:03e50321676de50ed6b7300c09bb04eb04e99354","dn":"Mine by Susi Fox EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"03e50321676de50ed6b7300c09bb04eb04e99354","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,229,3,33,103,109,229,14,214,183,48,12,9,187,4,235,4,233,147,84]},"name":"Mine by Susi Fox EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
