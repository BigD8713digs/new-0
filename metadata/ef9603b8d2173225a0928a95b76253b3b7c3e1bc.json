Rodgers and Hammerstein&apos;s first ever musical was an instant hit when it premiered on Broadway in 1943 and it&apos;s not hard to see why - it&apos;s chock full of toe-tapping classics, including Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin&apos;, People Will Say We&apos;re in Love, and of course the title song itself. With a stellar cast, sensational dance numbers and the unique energy of the John Wilson Orchestra, the magic of the original lives on in 2017.\r\n\r\n(with soft subtitles) \r\n\r\nFirst broadcast: 11 August 2017\r\nDuration:  3 hours","last_updated":"2017-08-12T12:04:04.980Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef9603b8d2173225a0928a95b76253b3b7c3e1bc","dn":"BBC Proms 2017 Prom 35 Oklahoma (720p HD, soft Eng subs)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"ef9603b8d2173225a0928a95b76253b3b7c3e1bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,150,3,184,210,23,50,37,160,146,138,149,183,98,83,179,183,195,225,188]},"name":"BBC Proms 2017 Prom 35 Oklahoma (720p HD, soft Eng subs)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
