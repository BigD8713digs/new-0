Dr. Collins has resolved the dilemma that haunts everyone who believes in God and respects science. Faith in God and faith in science can be harmonious, not separately but together, combined into one worldview. For Collins, science does not conflict with the Bible, science enhances it.\r\n\r\nThe Language of God makes the case for God and for science. Dr. Collins considers and dismisses several positions along the spectrum from atheism to young-earth creationism, including agnosticism and Intelligent Design. Instead, he proposes a new synthesis, a new way to think about an active, caring God who created humankind through evolutionary processes.\r\n\r\nHe explains his own journey from atheism to faith, and then takes readers on a stunning tour of modern science to show that physics, chemistry, and biology can all fit together with belief in God and the Bible. The Language of God is essential for anyone who wonders about the deepest questions of all: Why are we here? How did we get here? And what does life mean?\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-10-05T12:02:16.840Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:943bb4a891879c25fe5d481cb739c85279fcbfa6","dn":"The Language of God_ A Scientist Presents Evidence for Belief by","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"943bb4a891879c25fe5d481cb739c85279fcbfa6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,59,180,168,145,135,156,37,254,93,72,28,183,57,200,82,121,252,191,166]},"name":"The Language of God_ A Scientist Presents Evidence for Belief by","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
