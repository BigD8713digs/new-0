Through analysis of the diplomatic and military engagements around the Mediterranean and Indian Ocean, Muslu traces the interactions of these Islamic super-powers and their attitudes towards the wider world. This is the first detailed study of one of the most important political and cultural relationships in early-modern Islamic history.\r\n\r\nHardcover: 256 pages\r\nPublisher: I.B.Tauris (September 25, 2014)","last_updated":"2017-09-03T12:01:58.283Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:bdea5cd296cf5d2a41e9f71da0844bd9edbe43e3","dn":"The Ottomans and the Mamluks: Imperial Diplomacy and Warfare","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"bdea5cd296cf5d2a41e9f71da0844bd9edbe43e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,234,92,210,150,207,93,42,65,233,247,29,160,132,75,217,237,190,67,227]},"name":"The Ottomans and the Mamluks: Imperial Diplomacy and Warfare","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
