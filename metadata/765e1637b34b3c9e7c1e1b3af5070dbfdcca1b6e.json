This is the course for you. We will start from the very beginning, from &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t even know how use it..and why would I&#x201C; to actually understanding how React works and make it communicate with other technologies like Firebase and Node js. You will learn all the logic and practice behind React in different modules, and as we advance through the course we will be increasing the difficulty. Since I believe that the best way to fully learn is by coding, after each important section we will put everything in practice with some course projects, and after you have a strong base of React we will journey into Servers and Databases, Redux and deploying  apps to production.\r\n\r\nWho is the target audience?\r\n\r\n    From beginners in javascript to intermediate.\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n\r\n    Knowing a liitle bit of HTML, CSS and Javascript, everything else you will learn it as we go","last_updated":"2018-05-07T12:09:41.720Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:765e1637b34b3c9e7c1e1b3af5070dbfdcca1b6e","dn":"Udemy - The complete React Fullstack course","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"765e1637b34b3c9e7c1e1b3af5070dbfdcca1b6e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,94,22,55,179,75,60,158,124,30,27,58,245,7,13,191,220,202,27,110]},"name":"Udemy - The complete React Fullstack course","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
