The orchestration of &#x2018;Happy Come Home&#x2019; is largely eliminated, and although the production was never as stark as, say, &#x2018;The Milk-Eyed Mender&#x2019;, the power of Victoria&#x2019;s beautiful warble &#x2013; clear but never shrill &#x2013; is heard better than it would be on any subsequent release. The natural imagery that was a staple of her work is never more beautiful than on the bare, countrified &#x2018;Why Look at the Moon&#x2019;, which manages to sound totally unique within a familiar genre, whilst &#x2018;Boogieman&#x2019; goes even further in its combination of percussive funk with this simple country guitar creating a power whose purity no singer/songwriter of the era rivalled. &#x2018;Clothesline Song&#x2019;, which contains a snippet of Charles Chaplin&#x2019;s &#x2018;Swing Little Girl&#x2019;, is less dramatic but still beautiful. \r\n\r\n&#x2018;Vieux Amis&#x2019; is the most conventional country number on &#x2018;Swing the Statue&#x2019;, but Victoria&#x2019;s voice and the uptempo joyful atmosphere takes it far, then with &#x2018;Weeds&#x2019; Victoria produces perhaps the greatest combination of her Christian and naturalist influences. The lyrics are more complex than &#x2018;Wobbling&#x2019; &#x2013; detailing the sufferings of rural people &#x2013; but the shivering joy is the same. Closing spiritual &#x2018;Lift Him Up&#x2019; shows Victoria&#x2019;s unique take on a genuine gospel song. The off-kilter guitar and mandolin at the beginning sound off-putting at first but like almost everything here, fits together after a few listens. \r\n\r\nAll in all, &#x2018;Swing the Statue&#x2019; is a unique experience: its down-to-earth, trembling, joyful take on the arty singer/songwriter was very much &#x201C;against the grain&#x201D; of &#x201C;alternative&#x201D; culture when it was released, yet a quarter of a century later it still shines with genuine power. Along with Mary Margaret O&#x2018;Hara&#x2019;s Miss America plus Robin Holcomb&#x2019;s Robin Holcomb and Rockabye it stands as a lost treasure of its time.
