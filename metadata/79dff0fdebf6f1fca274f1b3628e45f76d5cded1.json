Tattooed and only 27, the meteoric success of her spin studio - and her recent engagement to her girlfriend - has made her the object of jealousy and vitriol from her castmates. \r\n\r\nKelly, Brett&apos;s older sister and business partner, is the most recent recruit, dismissed as a hanger-on by veteran cast. The golden child growing up, she defers to Brett now - a role that requires her to protect their shocking secret. \r\n\r\nStephanie, the first black cast member and the oldest, is a successful best-selling author of erotic novels. There have long been whispers about her hot, nonworking actor-husband and his wandering eye, but this season the focus is on the rift that has opened between her and Brett, former best friends - and resentment soon breeds contempt. \r\n\r\nLauren, the start-up world&apos;s darling whose drinking has gotten out of control, is Goal Diggers&apos; recovery narrative - everyone loves a comeback story. \r\n\r\nAnd Jen, made rich and famous through her cultishly popular vegan food line plays a holistic hippie for the cameras but is perhaps the most ruthless of them all when the cameras are off. \r\n\r\nThe Favorite Sister explores the invisible barriers that prevent women from rising up the ranks in today&apos;s America - and offers a scathing take on the oft-lionized bonds of sisterhood and the relentless pressure to stay young, relevant, and salable. \r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-05-16T12:01:20.510Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:79dff0fdebf6f1fca274f1b3628e45f76d5cded1","dn":"The Favorite Sister by Jessica Knoll EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"79dff0fdebf6f1fca274f1b3628e45f76d5cded1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,223,240,253,235,246,241,252,162,116,241,179,98,142,69,247,109,92,222,209]},"name":"The Favorite Sister by Jessica Knoll EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
