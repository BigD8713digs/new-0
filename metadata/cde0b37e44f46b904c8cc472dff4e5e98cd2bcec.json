With Trethewey&#x2019;s insightful touch and genius for plumbing the depths of history and personal experience to shape striking verse, The Best American Poetry 2017 is another brilliant addition to the series","last_updated":"2017-12-18T12:06:09.808Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:cde0b37e44f46b904c8cc472dff4e5e98cd2bcec","dn":"Best American Poetry 2017 - David Lehman [PDF]","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"cde0b37e44f46b904c8cc472dff4e5e98cd2bcec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,224,179,126,68,244,107,144,76,140,196,114,223,244,229,233,140,210,188,236]},"name":"Best American Poetry 2017 - David Lehman [PDF]","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
