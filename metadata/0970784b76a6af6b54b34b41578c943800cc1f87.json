But few of us ask how all these digital products are designed, or why. It&apos;s time we change that. Many of the services we rely on are full of oversights, biases, and downright ethical nightmares. Chatbots that harass women. Signup forms that fail anyone who&apos;s not straight. Social media sites that send peppy messages about dead relatives. Algorithms that put more black people behind bars.\r\n\r\nTechnically Wrong takes an unflinching look at the values, processes, and assumptions that lead to these problems and more. Wachter-Boettcher demystifies the tech industry, leaving those of us on the other side of the screen better prepared to make informed choices about the services we use - and demand more from the companies behind them.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-10-24T12:03:40.022Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:0970784b76a6af6b54b34b41578c943800cc1f87","dn":"Technically Wrong by Sara Wachter-Boettcher EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"0970784b76a6af6b54b34b41578c943800cc1f87","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,112,120,75,118,166,175,107,84,179,75,65,87,140,148,56,0,204,31,135]},"name":"Technically Wrong by Sara Wachter-Boettcher EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
