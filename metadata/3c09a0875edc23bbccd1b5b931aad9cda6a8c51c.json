Solaris (Part Two) 29:37\r\n\r\nI&#x2019;m rather flabbergasted by the excellence of this album, marking the first time in which the fruits of Nikita Golyshev&#x2019;s mind grace my ears. This Russian composer started doing his things in 2003, when he was involved in a duo called CD-R (that&#x2019;s right). Golyshev&#x2019;s prior work, we&#x2019;re told, ranges from &#x201C;rhythmic noise mayhem to diverse and heterogeneous experiments&#x201D;, but &#x201C;Solaris&#x201D; is clearly a disc of static electronica in the best tradition of those artists who individuate our soft spot with just a couple of elements and make them work for about one hour. Divided in two parts, the composition is almost immobile for lengthy tracts: a single suspended chord, not exactly consonant yet not really pungent, goes on and on for the initial half, only faintly disturbed by nearly unidentifiable backdrop presences that remain unconcealed at the end of the section. The second part is characterized by a splendid roomy drone who lets the imagination portray a typical flight amidst thick clouds, sun rays filtering through the algid amassing. A release that every enthusiast still believing in &#x2013; don&#x2019;t laugh &#x2013; the &#x201C;healing power of serious esoteric music&#x201D; (with a tendency to acute stillness) should enjoy no problem. This writer, unbelievably enough, liked it very much: a faultlessly executed straightforward concept. It takes a little intelligence and a &#x201C;less is more&#x201D; attitude to do way better than overproduced bulimic odes to the gods of ridiculousness. - Massimo Ricci, Touching Extremes (6 Nov 2007)","last_updated":"2017-07-29T12:03:18.247Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c09a0875edc23bbccd1b5b931aad9cda6a8c51c","dn":"Nikita Golyshev 2007 Solaris","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"3c09a0875edc23bbccd1b5b931aad9cda6a8c51c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,9,160,135,94,220,35,187,204,209,181,185,49,170,217,205,166,168,197,28]},"name":"Nikita Golyshev 2007 Solaris","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
