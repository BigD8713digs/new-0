A person&#x2019;s diet has arguably the most significant impact on their health out of any other habit they might have. In that sense, we really are what we eat. In response to a society driven by an extreme hunger for meat and animal products, more and more people are turning to veganism. This plant-based diet eliminates all animal products, and the results include resistance to serious disease, better heart health, and increased energy. So, veganism is great, but it sounds hard. So many of our favorite meals are based on meat, or at least have animal products in them, like eggs and dairy. What can a person do to make transitioning to (and maintaining) that diet easier? Two words: pressure cooking. Pressure cooking is the best way to prepare vegan staples like vegetables and beans because more nutritional value is preserved than through any other cooking method. This means more vitamins and minerals, like iron, which is something most vegans have trouble getting. This book focuses on the electric pressure cooker, a kitchen tool that is both fast and affordable. There are 100 vegan pressure cooking recipes contained in its pages, so you can start enjoying things like:\r\nChai-spiced oatmeal\r\nTofu scrambles\r\nCurry bowls\r\nHearty winter soups\r\n&#x201C;Cheese&#x201D; sauces\r\nCornbread and Thanksgiving stuffing\r\nSimple syrups\r\nCheesecakes and poached pears\r\nChocolate fondue\r\nVegan food has a reputation for being boring and tasteless, but it won&#x2019;t take you long to see just how untrue that is. By using ingredients like pureed cashews, non-dairy milk, seitan, beans, and more, you can continue making fan favorites by &#x201C;veganizing&#x201D; everything you love. Vegan pressure cooking will impress anyone who tastes your food","last_updated":"2018-07-11T12:09:27.878Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:ecf9d80e39e6ac80fe07aa72d3875b751425dfd8","dn":"Vegan Pressure Cooker Cookbook","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"ecf9d80e39e6ac80fe07aa72d3875b751425dfd8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,249,216,14,57,230,172,128,254,7,170,114,211,135,91,117,20,37,223,216]},"name":"Vegan Pressure Cooker Cookbook","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
