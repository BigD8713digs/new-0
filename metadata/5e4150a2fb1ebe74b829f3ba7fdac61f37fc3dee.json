Smith puts out new albums multiple times each year, but whatever the season might be, the music will feel like autumn. In any given recording, he might add up ambient waves, silk road folk drones and depleted blues. Or Death Valley twang and stadium rock might be have their sounds harvested and transformed. There&#x2019;s always the haze of a golden sundown, warmth that implies a colder season ahead. \r\nLately his Ulaan Passerine project has become where he works these styles together in to longer tracks, ten or twenty minutes or more. Smith switches identities frequently, but it&#x2019;s possible to tease out that the Passerine name is for longform work, standing in contrast to Ulaan Khol (heavier distortion), Ulaan Markhor (tighter rhythms), Hala Strana (Slavic overtones) or his own name (more austerity), though there&#x2019;s copious overlap. Because his catalog is so deep and worthy of immersion, the Worstward Recordings archive has become, more than any single set, the definitive place to get a grasp his aesthetic. There it all is: artwork of decaying flora, twenty years of focused meandering, various hand crafted and manufactured audio formats for sale. The two extended tracks that make Moss Cathedral provide a vivid tour through his techniques and show just how sharp his work can be. \r\n\r\n\r\nTracklist: \r\n01. Sanahin.flac \r\n02. The Folding Book.flac \r\n\r\nSummary: \r\nCountry: USA \r\nGenre: post-rock","last_updated":"2018-06-14T12:11:32.864Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e4150a2fb1ebe74b829f3ba7fdac61f37fc3dee","dn":"[post-rock] (2016) Ulaan Passerine - Moss Cathedral (24 bits) [F","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"5e4150a2fb1ebe74b829f3ba7fdac61f37fc3dee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,65,80,162,251,30,190,116,184,41,243,186,127,218,198,31,55,252,61,238]},"name":"[post-rock] (2016) Ulaan Passerine - Moss Cathedral (24 bits) [F","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
