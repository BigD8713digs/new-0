Its natural beauty attracts thousands of visitors every year, yet the county also is home to San Quentin Prison, one of the oldest and largest penitentiaries in the country. Marin ranks in the top one percent of counties nationwide in terms of affluence and overall health, yet it is far above the norm in drug overdoses and alcoholism, and comprises a large percentage of suicides from the Golden Gate Bridge.\r\n\r\nKen Holmes worked in the Marin County Coroner&apos;s Office for 36 years, starting as a death investigator and ending as the three-term, elected coroner. As he grew into the job - which is different from what is depicted on television - Holmes learned a variety of skills, from finding hidden clues at death scenes, interviewing witnesses effectively, managing bystanders and reporters, preparing testimony for court, to notifying families of a death with sensitivity and compassion. He also learned about different kinds of firearms, all types of drugs - prescription and illegal - and about certain unexpected and potentially fatal phenomena such as autoeroticism.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-09-03T12:00:26.025Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:87a340b8af61e8c32b3c7cdc4a701d08649965fe","dn":"The Education of a Coroner_ Lessons in Investigating Death by Jo","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"87a340b8af61e8c32b3c7cdc4a701d08649965fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,163,64,184,175,97,232,195,43,60,124,220,74,112,29,8,100,153,101,254]},"name":"The Education of a Coroner_ Lessons in Investigating Death by Jo","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
