An estimated forty million people died as the epidemic raged. Children were left orphaned and families were devastated. As many American soldiers were killed by the 1918 flu as were killed in battle during World War I. And no area of the globe was safe. Eskimos living in remote outposts in the frozen tundra were sickened and killed by the flu in such numbers that entire villages were wiped out.\r\n\r\nScientists have recently rediscovered shards of the flu virus frozen in Alaska and preserved in scraps of tissue in a government warehouse. Gina Kolata, an acclaimed reporter for &quot;The New York Times,&quot; unravels the mystery of this lethal virus with the high drama of a great adventure story. Delving into the history of the flu and previous epidemics, detailing the science and the latest understanding of this mortal disease, Kolata addresses the prospects for a great epidemic recurring, and, most important, what can be done to prevent it.\r\n\r\nPaperback: 352 pages\r\nPublisher: Farrar, Straus and Giroux; 1st edition (April 2011)","last_updated":"2017-12-13T12:00:30.793Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:f640b4a344cc87bc6fbcde4ba5fca58acae31ecc","dn":"Flu: The Story of the Great Influenza Pandemic of 1918","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"f640b4a344cc87bc6fbcde4ba5fca58acae31ecc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,64,180,163,68,204,135,188,111,188,222,75,165,252,165,138,202,227,30,204]},"name":"Flu: The Story of the Great Influenza Pandemic of 1918","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
