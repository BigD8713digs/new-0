Cue the Betches. First we helped you win at basically everything, and now we&apos;re going to help you win the most important battle a betch can face.\r\n\r\nMaybe you&apos;re a Delusional Dater who needs to get in touch with reality (seriously, he&apos;s just not that f***ing into you), or perhaps you&apos;re a TGF who needs to stop being so desperate and start playing the game. Or maybe you&apos;re just tired of swiping left and ready for the pro of your dreams to put a 15-karat diamond ring on it so you can stop pretending to do work. Either way, we&apos;ve got you covered.\r\n\r\nWith insight from the Betches&apos; own Head Pro, this book is a must-have Bible for any betch looking for love. So put away the Ben &amp; Jerry&apos;s fro-yo (just because it&apos;s low fat doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s okay to eat the whole tub), and start dating like a winner.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-10-25T12:02:45.245Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:e734cadc45704037a1eac15c5abeda1bf0e380dc","dn":"I Had a Nice Time and Other Lies... by The Betches EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"e734cadc45704037a1eac15c5abeda1bf0e380dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,52,202,220,69,112,64,55,161,234,193,92,90,190,218,27,240,227,128,220]},"name":"I Had a Nice Time and Other Lies... by The Betches EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
