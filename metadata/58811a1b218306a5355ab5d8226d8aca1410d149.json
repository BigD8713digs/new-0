Howie Mandel, Mel B, Heidi Klum and Simon Cowell returned as judges for their respective eighth, fifth, fifth, and second seasons.\r\n\r\nNick Cannon, who had hosted the show for eight seasons, announced on February 13, 2017, that he would not return as host for the twelfth season, soon after he made disparaging remarks about NBC in his 2017 Showtime comedy special, Stand Up, Don&apos;t Shoot. Cannon was still under contract to host, and NBC executives did not initially accept his resignation, but they ultimately searched for a new host. On March 12, 2017, NBC named supermodel and businesswoman Tyra Banks as the new host for season twelve - making her the first female host of America&apos;s Got Talent.\r\n\r\nThe live shows returned to the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles beginning August 15, 2017. The format of the show was the same as in season eleven, and Dunkin Donuts sponsored the show for a third consecutive year. A guest judge joined the panel for each episode of the Judge Cuts round: Chris Hardwick, DJ Khaled, Laverne Cox and Seal.\r\n\r\nOn October 4, 2016, Simon Cowell signed a contract to remain as a judge through 2019.
