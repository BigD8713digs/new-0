It&apos;s aimed at PC hardware enthusiasts, covering topics such as modding, overclocking and PC gaming. The first issue was released in October 2003 and it is published monthly. Audited circulation figures are 9,428 (ABC, Jan-Dec 2014). Gareth Ogden retired as editor of Custom PC at the end of Issue 52. Issue 53 was edited by Deputy Editor James Gorbold; from Issue 54 onwards the magazine was edited by Alex Watson. From Issue 87 to Issue 102 the magazine was edited by James Gorbold. From Issue 103 onward, the magazine has been edited by Ben Hardwidge.\r\n\r\nBetween 2009 and January 2012 the magazine was partnered with enthusiast site bit-tech.net, with the two editorial teams merging and sharing resources across both the site and the magazine. Custom PC&apos;s James Gorbold took over as Group Editor of the two teams. However, since February 2012, the two brands have separated and content is no longer shared between the two publications, although many of the magazine&apos;s writers continue to write for bit-tech","last_updated":"2017-06-09T12:00:41.117Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f720e3022702d5863df1a1258bfa3ca81fb4046","dn":"Custom PC - Issue 167 - August 2017 - True PDF - zeke23","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"2f720e3022702d5863df1a1258bfa3ca81fb4046","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,114,14,48,34,112,45,88,99,223,26,18,88,191,163,202,129,251,64,70]},"name":"Custom PC - Issue 167 - August 2017 - True PDF - zeke23","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
