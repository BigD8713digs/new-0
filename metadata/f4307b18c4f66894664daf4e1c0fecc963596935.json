After all, no one has seen or heard from her since they graduated over a year ago.\r\n\r\nExcept this girl isn&apos;t Nicole.\r\n\r\nShe looks exactly like Cal&apos;s shy childhood crush, but her name is Nyelle Preston and she has no idea who he is. This girl is impulsive and daring, her passion for life infectious. The complete opposite of Nicole. Cal finds himself utterly fascinated - and falling hard. But Nyelle is also extremely secretive. And the closer he comes to finding out what she&apos;s hiding, the less he wants to know.\r\n\r\nWhen the secrets from the past and present collide, one thing becomes clear: Nothing is what it seems.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-09-22T12:26:56.542Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:f4307b18c4f66894664daf4e1c0fecc963596935","dn":"What If by Rebecca Donovan EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"f4307b18c4f66894664daf4e1c0fecc963596935","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,48,123,24,196,246,104,148,102,77,175,78,28,15,236,201,99,89,105,53]},"name":"What If by Rebecca Donovan EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
