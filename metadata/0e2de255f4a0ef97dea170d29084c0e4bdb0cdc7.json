Therefore, the study of the physical properties of the gravity field and their geodetic application. which are the subject of physical geodesy, forms an essential part of the geodesist&apos;s education.\r\nDuring the ten years that have passed since the writing of The Earth and Its Gravity Field by Heiskanen and Vening Meinesz, geodesy has progressed enormously. To incorporate the results of this progress, which has been theoretical as well as practical, in a new edition of that book became increasingly impossible. It was necessary to write an entirely new textbook, one that is different in both scope and treatment. The great increase in the amount of available information required a strict limitation to geodetic aspects; advances in theory made necessary an increased emphasis on mathematical methods. The outcome is the present book, which is intended to be theoretical in the sense in which the word is used in the term &quot;theoretical physics.&quot;\r\nThis textbook, intended for graduate students, presupposes the background in mathematics and physics required by geodesy departments of American and European Universities. The necessary fundamentals of potential theory are presented in an introductory chapter.\r\nChapters I through 5 cover the material for a basic course in physical geodesy. Chapters 6 through 8 present a number of more specialized and advanced topics, where current research activity is high. (These chapters are likely to be more subjectively biased than the others.) The reader who has mastered them should be able to begin research of his own. For the sake of completeness we have added a chapter on celestial methods; this material may be included in the basic course","last_updated":"2017-08-10T12:01:35.910Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e2de255f4a0ef97dea170d29084c0e4bdb0cdc7","dn":"Heiskanen W.A., Moritz H. - Physical Geodesy - 1967","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"0e2de255f4a0ef97dea170d29084c0e4bdb0cdc7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,45,226,85,244,160,239,151,222,161,112,210,144,132,192,228,189,176,205,199]},"name":"Heiskanen W.A., Moritz H. - Physical Geodesy - 1967","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
