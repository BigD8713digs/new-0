Pushing through northern Georgia, Sherman&#x2019;s legendary March to the Sea shoves away any Rebel presence, and by Christmas 1864 the city of Savannah falls into the hands of &#x201C;Uncle Billy.&#x201D; Now there is but one direction for Sherman to go. In his way stands the last great hope for the Southern cause, General Joseph E. Johnston.\r\n\r\nIn the concluding novel of his epic Civil War tetralogy, Jeff Shaara tells the dramatic story of the final eight months of battle from multiple perspectives: the commanders in their tents making plans for total victory, as well as the ordinary foot soldiers and cavalrymen who carried out their orders until the last alarum sounded. Through Sherman&#x2019;s eyes, we gain insight into the mind of the general who vowed to &#x201C;make Georgia howl&#x201D; until it surrendered. In Johnston, we see a man agonizing over the limits of his army&#x2019;s power, and accepting the burden of leading the last desperate effort to ensure the survival of the Confederacy","last_updated":"2018-06-16T12:04:09.296Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:026dbf77c25f0f326632a6959b284019973b54a0","dn":"Jeff Shaara - [Blaze of Glory 04] - The Fateful Lightning (epub)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"026dbf77c25f0f326632a6959b284019973b54a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,109,191,119,194,95,15,50,102,50,166,149,155,40,64,25,151,59,84,160]},"name":"Jeff Shaara - [Blaze of Glory 04] - The Fateful Lightning (epub)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
