One was her daughter, Lady. The other was Lady&#x2019;s best friend, Nell - adopted after the sudden, heartbreaking death of her mother, the Bellemores&#x2019; beloved maid. Willa showered Nell with love and support, all the while ignoring the disdainful whispers of her neighbors. After all, they were family. Nell and Lady were sisters at heart - sisters who vowed to never let anything come between them.\r\n\r\nThen, on the night of Lady&#x2019;s sixteenth birthday, something went terribly wrong, sparking painful secrets and bitter resentments that went unspoken for three decades.\r\n\r\nNow Willa is dying, and Lady and Nell - each with a teenager of her own - are brought together after all these years. It&#x2019;s Willa&#x2019;s last wish. The time has come to confront what happened on that fateful night. But it may take a tragic twist of fate to reconcile the past and come to terms with the true meaning of family.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-10-14T12:02:22.544Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e3a04925f704756e3b51a9e7b6afa9a81dd68fa","dn":"Nell and Lady by Ashley Farley EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"1e3a04925f704756e3b51a9e7b6afa9a81dd68fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,58,4,146,95,112,71,86,227,181,26,158,123,106,250,154,129,221,104,250]},"name":"Nell and Lady by Ashley Farley EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
