Now What: Essays on War and Climate Change by Roy Scranton EPUB\r\n\r\nThe time we&apos;ve been thrown into is one of alarming and bewildering change - the breakup of the post-1945 global order, a multispecies mass extinction, and the beginning of the end of civilization as we know it. Not one of us is innocent, not one of us is safe. Now what?  \r\n\r\nWe&apos;re Doomed, Now What? addresses the crisis that is our time through a series of brilliant, moving, and original essays on climate change, war, literature, and loss from one of the most provocative and iconoclastic minds of his generation. \r\n\r\nWhether writing about sailing through the melting Arctic, preparing for Houston&apos;s next big storm, watching Star Wars, or going back to the streets of Baghdad he once patrolled as a soldier, Roy Scranton handles his subjects with the same electric, philosophical, demotic touch he brought to his groundbreaking New York Times essay, &quot;Learning How to Die in the Anthropocene&quot;.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-09-02T12:02:17.356Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:d772d7c1c3aefaff6eb0cf1d8f8673bf4c4fcdcf","dn":"We're Doomed.
