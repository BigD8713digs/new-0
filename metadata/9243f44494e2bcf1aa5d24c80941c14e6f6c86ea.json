As such, good performance measurement is a crucial component of improvement and planning, monitoring and control, comparison and benchmarking and also ensures democratic accountability. This book shows how the principles, uses and practice of performance measurement for public services differ from those in for-profit organisations, being based on the need to add public value rather than profit. It describes methods and approaches for measuring performance through time, for constructing and using scorecards, composite indicators, the use of league tables and rankings and argues that data-envelopment analysis is a useful tool when thinking about performance. \r\n\r\n---\r\n <a href=\"\nhttp://dlfeb.com/book/measuring-performance-of-public-services-principles-and-practice/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttp://dlfeb.com/book/measuring-performance-of-public-services-principles-and-practice/</a>","last_updated":"2017-08-05T12:05:31.278Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:9243f44494e2bcf1aa5d24c80941c14e6f6c86ea","dn":"MEASURING THE PERFORMANCE OF PUBLIC SERVICES","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"9243f44494e2bcf1aa5d24c80941c14e6f6c86ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,67,244,68,148,226,188,241,170,93,36,200,9,65,193,78,111,108,134,234]},"name":"MEASURING THE PERFORMANCE OF PUBLIC SERVICES","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
