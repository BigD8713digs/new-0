Now, for the first time since its original publication in 1942, Penguin Classics presents this exclusive edition of Steinbeck&apos;s introduction to the then-nascent US Army Air Force and its bomber crew - the essential core unit behind American air power that Steinbeck described as &quot;the greatest team in the world&quot;.\r\n\r\nFor more than 70 years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.
