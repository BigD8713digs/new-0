Since his first and last posting was to U-505, Goebeler&apos;s perspective of the crew, commanders, and war patrols paints a vivid and complete portrait unlike any other to come out of the Kriegsmarine. He witnessed it all, from deadly sabotage efforts that almost sunk the boat to the tragic suicide of the only U-boat commander who took his life during World War II. The vivid, honest, and smooth-flowing prose calls it like it was and pulls no punches.\r\n\r\nU-505 was captured by Captain Dan Gallery&apos;s Guadalcanal Task Group 22.3 on June 4, 1944. Trapped by this &quot;hunter-killer&quot; group, U-505 was depth-charged to the surface, strafed by machine gun fire, and boarded. It was the first ship captured at sea since the War of 1812. Today, hundreds of thousands of visitors tour U-505 each year at the Chicago Museum of Science and Industry.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-04-20T12:42:38.563Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9afc1c3abe827ee8ba230dd533459beaecb8c19","dn":"Steel Boat Iron Hearts by Hans Goebeler EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"c9afc1c3abe827ee8ba230dd533459beaecb8c19","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,175,193,195,171,232,39,238,139,162,48,221,83,52,89,190,174,203,140,25]},"name":"Steel Boat Iron Hearts by Hans Goebeler EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
