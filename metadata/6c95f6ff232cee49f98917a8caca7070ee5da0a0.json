Romero ePUB eBOOK-ZAK\r\n\r\nIn 1968 the world experienced a brand-new kind of terror with the debut of George A. Romero&apos;s landmark film Night of the Living Dead. This was something new...and terrifying. Since then, zombies have invaded every aspect of popular culture.\r\n\r\nBut it all started on that dreadful night in a remote farmhouse.\r\n\r\nNights of the Living Dead returns to that night, to the outbreak, to where it all began. New York Times best-selling author Jonathan Maberry teams up with the godfather of the living dead himself, George A. Romero, to present a collection of all-new tales set during the 48 hours of that legendary outbreak.\r\n\r\nNights of the Living Dead includes stories by some of today&apos;s most important writers: Brian Keene, Carrie Ryan, Chuck Wendig, Craig Engler, David J. Schow, David Wellington, Issac Marion, Jay Bonansinga, Joe R. Lansdale, Joe McKinney, John Russo, John Skipp, Keith RA DeCandido, Max Brallier, Mike Carey, Mira Grant, Neal and Brandon Shusterman, and Sandra and Ryan Brown, plus original stories by Romero and Maberry.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-07-18T12:00:20.743Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c95f6ff232cee49f98917a8caca7070ee5da0a0","dn":"Nights of the Living Dead by Jonathan Maberry and George A.
