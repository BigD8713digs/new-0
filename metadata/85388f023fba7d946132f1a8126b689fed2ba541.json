They started \r\n out doing late night busking sessions in the City - creating their own unique \r\n versions of hip-hop and pop tracks. After entertaining crowds of hundreds on \r\n the street, they began using what they&apos;d learned, and earned, on writing and \r\n recording original music. Their debut EP was well received, ultimately \r\n resulting in their signing to Universal. While still known for their killer \r\n live remixes - the boys have been working hard to produce studio records that \r\n reflect where they want to take their sound.\r\n\r\n*****\r\nBand:\r\n*****\r\n Shaan Singh - Saxophone | Lead Vocals | Synth\r\n Matt Beachen - Drums\r\n Sam Thomson - Bass | Synth | Vocals\r\n Ben O&apos;Leary - Guitar | Vocals\r\n\r\n\r\n*********\r\nIncludes:\r\n*********\r\n\r\n| ****\r\n| EPs:\r\n| ****\r\n|\r\n| Drax Project EP {August 3, 2014 } 320kbps\r\n|  \r\n|    1) Real\r\n|    2) City Lights\r\n|    3) Watching ft.
