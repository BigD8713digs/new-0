The infamous shoe/throwing show.

(This show is well-known among fans because halfway through the set, fans in the pit began pelting the band with shoes, provoking Vedder and the band to walk off stage, only to come out and play the rest of the set from behind a wall of speakers.) Although band management had chosen this untested and under-developed site as part of a boycott of Ticketmaster and the Southern California auditoriums it controlled, the event established the new venue&apos;s suitability for large-scale rock events","last_updated":"2017-10-14T12:03:32.927Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd91e0026ebba51112b6e0ffa864ba74af0ed5d2","dn":"Pearl Jam - Indio CA.(Live 2-CD) 1993 ak320","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"bd91e0026ebba51112b6e0ffa864ba74af0ed5d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,145,224,2,110,187,165,17,18,182,224,255,168,100,186,116,175,14,213,210]},"name":"Pearl Jam - Indio CA.(Live 2-CD) 1993 ak320","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
