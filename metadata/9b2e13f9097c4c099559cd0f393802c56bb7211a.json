The cooks have two and a half hours to prepare their ultimate sharing feast, which must contain at least four dishes designed to showcase their individual personality. The cooks are up against it as they try to impress the judges with the complementary dishes that must come together as a complete meal.\r\n\r\nIt is then time for the cooks&apos; challenge. The judges have chosen a classic chicken dish that requires precision, care and skill to execute correctly. At the end, one more cook must leave the group, with just four fighting on for the title of Britain&apos;s best home cook. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal Air Date: 07-Jun-2018","last_updated":"2018-06-08T12:12:19.082Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b2e13f9097c4c099559cd0f393802c56bb7211a","dn":"Britains.Best.Home.Cook.S01E06.WEB-DL.x264-JIVE.mp4","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"9b2e13f9097c4c099559cd0f393802c56bb7211a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,46,19,249,9,124,76,9,149,89,205,15,57,56,2,197,107,183,33,26]},"name":"Britains.Best.Home.Cook.S01E06.WEB-DL.x264-JIVE.mp4","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
