It is a red state in the heart of Trumpland that hasn&apos;t elected a Democrat to a statewide office in more than 20 years; but it is also a state in which minorities already form a majority (including the largest number of Muslim adherents). The cities are blue and among the most diverse in the nation. Oil is still king, but Texas now leads California in technology exports. The Texas economic model of low taxes and minimal regulation has produced extraordinary growth but also striking income disparities. Texas looks a lot like the America that Donald Trump wants to create. And Wright&apos;s profound portrait of the state reflects our country back not only as it is but as it was and as it might be. \r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-04-18T15:05:20.740Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:aece57416a925dae852e269894a166e45270a82f","dn":"God Save Texas by Lawrence Wright EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"aece57416a925dae852e269894a166e45270a82f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,206,87,65,106,146,93,174,133,46,38,152,148,161,102,228,82,112,168,47]},"name":"God Save Texas by Lawrence Wright EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
