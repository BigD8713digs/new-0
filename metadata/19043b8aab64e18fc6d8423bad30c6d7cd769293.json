It was a period that saw the creation of Protestant kingdoms in England and Scotland, the gain and loss of American colonies and the beginnings of a new empire in Africa, India and Australasia. It is a slice of our past represented by some of the most compelling personalities to have graced the historical stage &#x2013; Elizabeth I, Nelson, Cromwell and Byron amongst them.\r\n\r\nGenre: Non-Fiction &gt; History","last_updated":"2018-10-08T12:28:32.053Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:19043b8aab64e18fc6d8423bad30c6d7cd769293","dn":"Leviathan: The Rise of Britain ... by David Scott (.epub)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"19043b8aab64e18fc6d8423bad30c6d7cd769293","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,4,59,138,171,100,225,143,198,216,66,59,173,48,198,215,205,118,146,147]},"name":"Leviathan: The Rise of Britain ... by David Scott (.epub)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
