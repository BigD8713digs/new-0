Hodgkinson had been a co-founder of Henry Cow, he and fellow H.C. co-founder Gilonis began to record together in 1980. Their experimental sonic creations led to the formation of an independent record label, Woof Records, and to the formation of The Work, including Mick Hobbs on bass and Rick Wilson on drums. \r\n... \r\nIn 1989 The Work reformed with its original members and recorded Rubber Cage. They then toured Europe for the next two years. In 1992, they recorded their final album, See; and in 1993 they played at the St. Petersburg Open Music Festival in Russia. The Work&apos;s final live performances were in Italy, Switzerland, Germany, Slovenia and the Czech Republic in 1994 .In 2010 The 4th World, an album that had been recorded live in Breisgau in that final year, was released by Ad Hoc Records. The original recording was mono, but it was mastered into stereo by Udi Koomran. - progarchives.com","last_updated":"2017-06-03T12:01:11.529Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:f93a81c52e57e2fac2142564e774b5402b446a5a","dn":"The Work 1992 See","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"f93a81c52e57e2fac2142564e774b5402b446a5a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,58,129,197,46,87,226,250,194,20,37,100,231,116,181,64,43,68,106,90]},"name":"The Work 1992 See","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
