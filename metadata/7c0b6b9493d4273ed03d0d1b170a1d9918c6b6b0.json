Beware\r\nwhat you&apos;re posting, just because you want to prank someone.\r\n\r\nThis release is an accomplishment of weeks of investigating,\r\nexperimenting, testing and lots of hard work.\r\n\r\nWe know that there is a server emulator out in the open, which\r\nmakes the game playable, but when you look at our cracked\r\ncontent, you will know that it can&apos;t be compared to that.\r\n\r\nOur work does not construct any program deviation or any kind\r\nof host file paradox solutions. Install game and copy the\r\ncracked content, it&apos;s that simple.\r\n\r\nSince we don&apos;t want to see cheap imitations, we protected our\r\nwork with a solid shield. Not because we want to deceive the\r\nmajority, like certain people out there, but because we have\r\nin the past been an open book of knowledge for our competitors.\r\n\r\nReal cracking is done by The Leading Force","last_updated":"2017-10-30T12:02:28.496Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c0b6b9493d4273ed03d0d1b170a1d9918c6b6b0","dn":"Assassins.Creed.II-SKIDROW","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"7c0b6b9493d4273ed03d0d1b170a1d9918c6b6b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,11,107,148,147,212,39,62,208,61,13,27,23,10,29,153,24,198,182,176]},"name":"Assassins.Creed.II-SKIDROW","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
