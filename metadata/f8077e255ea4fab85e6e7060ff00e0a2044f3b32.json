Trita Parsi, a Middle East foreign policy expert who advised the Obama White House throughout the talks and had access to decision-makers and diplomats on the US and Iranian sides alike, examines every facet of a triumph that could become as important and consequential as Nixon&apos;s rapprochement with China.\r\n\r\nDrawing from more than 75 in-depth interviews with key decision-makers, including Iran&apos;s Foreign Minister Javad Zarif and US Secretary of State John Kerry, this is the first authoritative account of President Obama&apos;s signature foreign policy achievement.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-10-03T12:03:42.168Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:f8077e255ea4fab85e6e7060ff00e0a2044f3b32","dn":"Losing an Enemy_ Obama, Iran, and the Triumph of Diplomacy by Tr","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"f8077e255ea4fab85e6e7060ff00e0a2044f3b32","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,7,126,37,94,164,250,184,94,110,112,96,255,0,224,162,4,79,59,50]},"name":"Losing an Enemy_ Obama, Iran, and the Triumph of Diplomacy by Tr","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
