The results are less carefree or pop-friendly, and instead comprise an engrossing conceptual journey that demands full attention, especially considering the album&apos;s underlying mythology. Dark and intense, it&apos;s a gift to dedicated fans, a theory-packed, multi-media puzzle for those interested in delving into a rich story occupied by symbolic entities like Dema, the journal-writing Clancy, the mysterious Nico, and the nine bishops from the Blurryface days. It&apos;s a heady maze, but a subtle nod to diehards in their so-called Skeleton Clique","last_updated":"2018-10-07T12:50:35.862Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:77f61e1c176ca384e2ed0ee8f561e9969187d6ec","dn":"Twenty One Pilots - Trench (2018) [24.44 FLAC]","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"77f61e1c176ca384e2ed0ee8f561e9969187d6ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,246,30,28,23,108,163,132,226,237,14,232,245,97,233,150,145,135,214,236]},"name":"Twenty One Pilots - Trench (2018) [24.44 FLAC]","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
