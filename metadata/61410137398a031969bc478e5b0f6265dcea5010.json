Inspired by her own reflections on more than 50 years of life as a young girl, a woman, a wife, and a mother, She Walks in Beauty draws on poetry&#x2019;s eloquent wisdom to ponder the many joys and challenges of being a woman.\r\n\r\nKennedy has divided the collection into sections that signify to her the most notable milestones, passages, and universal experiences in a woman&#x2019;s life, and she begins each of these sections with an introduction in which she explores and celebrates the most important elements of life&#x2019;s journey.\r\n\r\nThe collection includes works by Elizabeth Bishop, Sharon Olds, Edna St. Vincent Millay, Mary Oliver, Pablo Neruda, W. H. Auden, Adrienne Rich, Sandra Cisneros, Anne Sexton, W. S. Merwin, Dorothy Parker, Queen Elizabeth I, Lucille Clifton, Naomi Shahib Nye, and W. B. Yeats.\r\n\r\nWhether it&#x2019;s falling in love, breaking up, friendship, marriage, motherhood, or growing old, She Walks in Beauty is a priceless resource for anyone, male or female, who wants a deeper understanding and appreciation of what it means to be a woman.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-04-16T17:01:52.669Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:61410137398a031969bc478e5b0f6265dcea5010","dn":"She Walks in Beauty by Caroline Kennedy EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"61410137398a031969bc478e5b0f6265dcea5010","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,65,1,55,57,138,3,25,105,188,71,142,91,15,98,101,220,234,80,16]},"name":"She Walks in Beauty by Caroline Kennedy EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
