Updated chapters include gold nanoparticle preparation methods, their plasmon resonance and thermo-optical properties, their catalytic properties and their future technological applications. New chapters have been included, and reveal the growing impact of plasmonics in research, with an introduction to quantum plasmonics, plasmon assisted catalysis and electro-photon conversion. The growing field of nanoparticles for health is also addressed with a study of gold nanoparticles as radiosensibiliser for radiotherapy, and of gold nanoparticle functionalisation. This new edition also considers the relevance of bimetallic nanoparticles for specific applications.\r\nWorld-class scientists provide the most up-to-date findings for an introduction to gold nanoparticles within the related areas of chemistry, biology, material science, optics and physics. It is perfectly suited to advanced level students and researchers looking to enhance their knowledge in the study of gold nanoparticles.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\nAbout the Authors xxi\r\n1.
