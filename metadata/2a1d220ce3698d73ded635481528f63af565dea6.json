In this film, composer Howard Goodall explores just why this album is still seen as so innovative, so revolutionary and so influential. With the help of outtakes and studio conversations between the band, never heard before outside of Abbey Road, Howard gets under the bonnet of Sgt Pepper. He takes the music apart and reassembles it, to show us how it works - and makes surprising connections with the music of the last 1,000 years to do so.\r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n * Video Codec: x265/HEVC CABAC Main10 L4\r\n * Video Bitrate: CRF 21 (~2641Kbps)\r\n * Video Resolution: 1920x1080\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\n * Frame Rate: 25 FPS\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC-LC\r\n * Audio Bitrate: Q=0.50 VBR 48KHz (~128Kbps)\r\n * Audio Channels: 2\r\n * Run-Time: 59 mins\r\n * Number of Parts: 1\r\n * Part Size: 1.14 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Subtitles: Merged","last_updated":"2017-12-09T12:07:46.441Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a1d220ce3698d73ded635481528f63af565dea6","dn":"BBC Sgt Peppers Musical Revolution 1080p x265 AAC HDTV MVGroup.o","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"2a1d220ce3698d73ded635481528f63af565dea6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,29,34,12,227,105,141,115,222,214,53,72,21,40,246,58,245,101,222,166]},"name":"BBC Sgt Peppers Musical Revolution 1080p x265 AAC HDTV MVGroup.o","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
