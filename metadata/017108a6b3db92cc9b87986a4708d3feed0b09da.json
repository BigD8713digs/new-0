Install these drivers if you plan to transfer files to your computer via USB, or for Android development purposes.\r\n\r\nNote: You can get these drivers via Samsung Kies (SK) if you have it installed on your Windows computer. But if you can&apos;t be bothered with Samsung Kies, then get this torrent to save you time installing the bloatware SK crap just to get the USB drivers.\r\n\r\nSamsung has removed a lot of support for their legacy mobile hardware devices in this latest incarnation of their USB drivers for Windows (Note: Samsung don&apos;t create public Release Notes for their USB drivers software package so it&apos;s hard to know which mobile hardware devices have been dropped from this release.) Please keep an old version of the Samsung USB drivers around in case you need to use older Samsung mobile devices in Windows or just for Android development. If you need to support legacy mobile hardware devices, my advice for you is install the oldest Samsung USB drivers you have and let Windows Update provides the rest seeing you can&apos;t install multiple versions of the Samsung USB drivers.\r\n\r\n\r\n---------------------------\r\nPrerequisite requirements:\r\n---------------------------\r\n1. Microsoft Windows 32-bit or 64-bit PC with 40MB free of disk space.\r\n2. Uninstall previous version of the same driver.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------------\r\nSteps to install the USB drivers:\r\n----------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Run &quot;Samsung.Mobile.Devices.USB.Drivers.1.5.60.exe&quot; as an Administrator on your Windows PC.\r\n\r\n2. Follow instructions on screen to install the Samsung USB drivers.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy","last_updated":"2017-09-26T12:11:59.103Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:017108a6b3db92cc9b87986a4708d3feed0b09da","dn":"Samsung USB Drivers fole Devices v1.5.63 Windows Installer","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"017108a6b3db92cc9b87986a4708d3feed0b09da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,113,8,166,179,219,146,204,155,135,152,106,71,8,211,254,237,11,9,218]},"name":"Samsung USB Drivers fole Devices v1.5.63 Windows Installer","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
