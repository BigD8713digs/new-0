In Athens she reveals Bacchus&apos;s pivotal role in a society where his ecstatic worship was embraced by all classes, and most importantly women. On Cyprus she uncovers startling parallels between Bacchus and Christ. Finally, Bettany follows the god&apos;s modern embrace in Nietzsche&apos;s philosophy, experimental theatre and the hedonistic hippie movement to conclude that, while this god of ecstasy is worthy of contemporary reconsideration, it is vital to heed the warning of the ancients - &quot;MEDEN AGAN&quot; - nothing in excess.\r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC High L4.1\r\n * Video Bitrate: CRF 21 (~3812Kbps)\r\n * Video Resolution: 1920x1080\r\n * Frame Rate: 25 FPS\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC-LC\r\n * Audio Bitrate: Q=0.45 VBR 48KHz (~128Kbps)\r\n * Audio Channels: 2\r\n * Run-Time: 58 mins\r\n * Part Size: 1.61 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Subtitles: Merged","last_updated":"2018-04-13T17:05:48.378Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0477f83e610d25a9a84a8b080d2388b6642c703","dn":"BBC Bacchus Uncovered Ancient God of Ecstasy 1080p x264 AAC HDTV","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"c0477f83e610d25a9a84a8b080d2388b6642c703","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,71,127,131,230,16,210,90,154,132,168,176,128,210,56,139,102,66,199,3]},"name":"BBC Bacchus Uncovered Ancient God of Ecstasy 1080p x264 AAC HDTV","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
