It continues to build on concepts learned in the &#x201C;5 Days to a Better Accent&#x201D; course. While the &#x201C;5 Days&#x201D; course focused on the more rhythmic and melodic aspects of spoken English, this course focuses on individual sounds that can be problematic. The class was created specifically to target the most frequent and characteristic sounds of American English that are typically difficult and/or unknown for non-native English speakers: the schwa, ER, R colored vowels, R, short i, long e, L, ED endings, S, Z and S endings. Focusing on the most high frequency problematic sounds allows you to more quickly and effectively make changes in your pronunciation.\r\n\r\nWho is the target audience?\r\n\r\n    Non-native English speakers wanting to improve their pronunciation of difficult sounds in American English\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n\r\n    Have a high intermediate to advanced English level. Complete the &#x201C;5 Days to a Better Accent&#x201D; course.\r\n\r\nLast updated 9/2018","last_updated":"2018-10-22T12:02:54.289Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:0fa5791a60d45d913b9a614756ca47350eb3878d","dn":"American English: Important Sounds for Perfect Pronunciation","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"0fa5791a60d45d913b9a614756ca47350eb3878d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,165,121,26,96,212,93,145,59,154,97,71,86,202,71,53,14,179,135,141]},"name":"American English: Important Sounds for Perfect Pronunciation","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
