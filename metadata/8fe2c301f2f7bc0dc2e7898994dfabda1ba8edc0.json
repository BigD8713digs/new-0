After selling a stick to Tree Trunks, the two get lost and end up at the dungeon where Gumbald is staying. They sell him Finn&apos;s baby teeth which he happily pays for with a silver cup. Finn is outraged that his baby teeth were sold and is further mortified when Baby Finns made of teeth begin attacking the tree house. Through Ice King&apos;s encouragement, BMO &quot;sells&quot; two mallets to Finn and Jake and they successfully defeat the teeth babies. Afterwards, Gumbald admits that his current plan was a bad idea","last_updated":"2017-09-19T12:52:31.086Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:8fe2c301f2f7bc0dc2e7898994dfabda1ba8edc0","dn":"Adventure.Time.S09.E16.WEBRip.x264.mp4","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"8fe2c301f2f7bc0dc2e7898994dfabda1ba8edc0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,226,195,1,242,247,188,13,194,231,137,137,148,223,171,218,27,168,237,192]},"name":"Adventure.Time.S09.E16.WEBRip.x264.mp4","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
