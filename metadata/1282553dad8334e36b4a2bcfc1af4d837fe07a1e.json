Her story is a thoroughly American one, of a girl who loved reading and horses and who understood from a very young age what she wanted?and who also knew she&apos;d have to get every step of the way there on her own.\r\n\r\nPeople can&apos;t stop talking about Stormy Daniels. And they won&apos;t be able to stop talking about her fresh, surprising, completely candid, nothing-held-back book.\r\n\r\nGenre: Non-Fiction &gt; Biographies &amp; Memoirs","last_updated":"2018-10-03T12:16:55.652Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:1282553dad8334e36b4a2bcfc1af4d837fe07a1e","dn":"Full Disclosure by Stormy Daniels (.epub)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"1282553dad8334e36b4a2bcfc1af4d837fe07a1e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,130,85,61,173,131,52,227,107,74,43,207,193,175,77,131,127,224,122,30]},"name":"Full Disclosure by Stormy Daniels (.epub)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
