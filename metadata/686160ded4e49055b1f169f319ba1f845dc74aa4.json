Instead of looking abroad for inspiration, Humm and Guidara headed to their own backyards, exploring more than fifty farms in the greater New York area and diving into the city&#x2019;s rich culinary heritage as a cultural melting pot. \r\n\r\nIn I Love New York, Humm and Guidara present an in-depth look at the region&#x2019;s centuries-old farming traditions along with nearly 150 recipes that highlight its outstanding ingredients&#x2014;from apples, celery root, and foie gras to nettles, pork, scallops, and venison. Included among these dishes designed explicitly for the home cook are reinterpretations of New York classics, like Oyster Pan Roast, Manhattan Clam Chowder, and the Bloody Mary. Lushly illustrated with photographs of the area&#x2019;s dramatic landscapes and the farmers who tend the land, this unique ode introduces the concept of New York regional cuisine as it celebrates the bounty of this exceptional state.\r\n\r\nGenre: Non-Fiction &gt; Food &amp; Drink","last_updated":"2018-09-17T12:16:45.958Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:686160ded4e49055b1f169f319ba1f845dc74aa4","dn":"I Love New York: Ingredients and Recipes by Daniel Humm  (.epub)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"686160ded4e49055b1f169f319ba1f845dc74aa4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,97,96,222,212,228,144,85,177,241,105,243,25,186,31,132,93,199,74,164]},"name":"I Love New York: Ingredients and Recipes by Daniel Humm  (.epub)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
