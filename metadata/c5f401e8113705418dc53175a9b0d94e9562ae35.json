At his villa, a general of the South Vietnamese army is drinking whiskey and, with the help of his trusted captain, drawing up a list of those who will be given passage aboard the last flights out of the country. The general and his compatriots start a new life in Los Angeles, unaware that one among their number, the captain, is secretly observing and reporting on the group to a higher-up in the Viet Cong.\r\n\r\nThe Sympathizer is the story of this captain: a man brought up by an absent French father and a poor Vietnamese mother, a man who went to university in America, but returned to Vietnam to fight for the Communist cause. A gripping spy novel, an astute exploration of extreme politics, and a moving love story, The Sympathizer explores a life between two worlds and examines the legacy of the Vietnam War in literature, film, and the wars we fight today.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-12-30T12:03:20.657Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:c5f401e8113705418dc53175a9b0d94e9562ae35","dn":"The Sympathizer_ A Novel by Viet Thanh Nguyen EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"c5f401e8113705418dc53175a9b0d94e9562ae35","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,244,1,232,17,55,5,65,141,197,49,117,169,176,217,78,149,98,174,53]},"name":"The Sympathizer_ A Novel by Viet Thanh Nguyen EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
