Ever since I was about 14 years old I read everything I could get my hands on. Sometimes I&#x2019;d think I had it figured out, but would soon bounce back to where I was before. Nothing seemed to be enough to hold my attention for long. Finally I wasn&#x2019;t doing anything with any program any more. And the same goes for other things in my life. So now I am almost 38 years old, and never achieved much, in spite of my far-more-than-average knowledge of self-help, positive thinking, the ways of the mind, etc. Then I read this.And now, for once, I feel a silence in my mind, body, and spirit like I never experienced. I am grateful to you in a way I cannot express. And I know this is only the beginning. Thank you Vish, for helping me achieve what no other teacher ever could.&#x201D; Carlos V- Program Participant","last_updated":"2018-08-26T12:05:06.802Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:f3aaa96b5f176fd2bececc11a864b53706038e52","dn":"Skills to Getting Things Done by Sri Vishwanath (.epub)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"f3aaa96b5f176fd2bececc11a864b53706038e52","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,170,169,107,95,23,111,210,190,206,204,17,168,100,181,55,6,3,142,82]},"name":"Skills to Getting Things Done by Sri Vishwanath (.epub)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
