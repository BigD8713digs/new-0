Three years later, a handful of survivors returned with an abundance of spices from their intended destination, but with just one ship carrying eighteen emaciated men. During their remarkable voyage around the world the crew endured starvation, disease, mutiny, and torture. Many men died, including Magellan, who was violently killed in a fierce battle.\r\n\r\nThis is the first full account in nearly half a century of this voyage into history: a tour of the world emerging from the Middle Ages into the Renaissance; a startling anthropological account of tribes, languages, and customs unknown to Europeans; and a chronicle of a desperate grab for commercial and political power.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-11-25T13:54:23.402Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7c48f26502db0a97c226407296b65e3ad069d42","dn":"Over the Edge of the World by Laurence Bergreen EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"b7c48f26502db0a97c226407296b65e3ad069d42","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,196,143,38,80,45,176,169,124,34,100,7,41,107,101,227,173,6,157,66]},"name":"Over the Edge of the World by Laurence Bergreen EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
