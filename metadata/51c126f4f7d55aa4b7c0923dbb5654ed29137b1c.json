Software provides a virtual private network (VPN) between your laptop and a wireless access point. This impenetrable tunnel protects your e-mail messages and all data sent over the network, from access to spies and hackers. As a result, you will remain anonymous and protect your privacy.\t\r\n\r\nEnsure you are private, secure, and anonymous online!\r\n&#x2022; Secure your web session, data, online shopping, and personal information online with HTTPS encryption.\r\n&#x2022; Protect yourself from identity theft online.\r\n&#x2022; Hide your IP address for your privacy online.\r\n&#x2022; Access all content privately without censorship; bypass firewalls.\r\n&#x2022; Protect yourself from snoopers at Wi-Fi hotspots, hotels, airports, corporate offices.\r\n&#x2022; Works on wireless and wired connections alike. Provides Unlimited Bandwidth.\r\n&#x2022; Works on the PC and the MAC, including new operating systems (Windows 7 and Snow Leopard)\r\n\r\nHotspot Shield is a software solution that adds a new security layer to your computer, as it has the necessary features to secure a wi-fi and a wired connection even in public places.\r\n\r\nIn just a few words, what Hotspot Shield does is to actually protect data transfers, so every bit you&#x2019;ll send when connected to a certain network will be encrypted, no matter if we&#x2019;re talking about private information, bank accounts or any other type of details.\r\n\r\nDeploying the app is a bit annoying, since it attempts to install some other unnecessary software, but not as annoying as the program per se. \r\n\r\nAlthough you&#x2019;d be tempted to believe that advertisements won&#x2019;t be displayed anymore since you&#x2019;ve unchecked the installation of the other applications, you&#x2019;re wrong. Hotspot Shield not only that attempts to block Google and take you onto another search engine, just for your personal security, but also displays advertisements in any browser, on any website","last_updated":"2017-11-24T12:05:18.339Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:51c126f4f7d55aa4b7c0923dbb5654ed29137b1c","dn":"Hotspot Shield 7.4.2.10815.Full","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"51c126f4f7d55aa4b7c0923dbb5654ed29137b1c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,193,38,244,247,213,90,164,183,192,146,61,187,86,84,237,41,19,123,28]},"name":"Hotspot Shield 7.4.2.10815.Full","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
