Malliet, a tale of murder in the haunts of England&#x2019;s privileged\r\nWeycombe is the chocolate-box village of everyone&#x2019;s dreams. For American Jillian White, a gated life of pleasure and comfort with her titled English husband was a fantasy come true.\r\nBut the murder of a local estate agent mars the village&#x2019;s so-pretty surface. Are people actually dying to live in Weycombe? Jill investigates, piecing together clues along the snaking paths and winding lanes of her adopted village. She knows truth has many versions, depending on who is doing the telling. And that few can be trusted in Weycombe, where nothing is as perfect as it seems","last_updated":"2017-10-21T12:03:29.579Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:165de9711ff1be9cc693cd21af1a81ce2300b822","dn":"G.M.
