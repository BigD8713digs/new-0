The planet provides a lush but inexplicable landscape - trees offer edible, addictive fruit one day and poison the next, while the ruins of an alien race are found entwined in the roots of a strange plant. Conflicts between generations arise as they struggle to understand one another and grapple with an unknowable alien intellect.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-02-08T12:07:06.029Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:17cf4918899548b5ac3b4cd893451d2e3fb12f9a","dn":"Semiosis_ A Novel by Sue Burke EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"17cf4918899548b5ac3b4cd893451d2e3fb12f9a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,207,73,24,137,149,72,181,172,59,76,216,147,69,29,46,63,177,47,154]},"name":"Semiosis_ A Novel by Sue Burke EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
