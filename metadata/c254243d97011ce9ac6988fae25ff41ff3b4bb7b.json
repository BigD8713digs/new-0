Here is a working one. Ther other one shows &quot;downloading&quot; instead of seeding, and is always at 0% even after &quot;Force Recheck&quot;. Rest of the description is from the other torrent:\r\n\r\nThis is the driver that Behringer stopped distributing for whatever reasons. Now they only link to the ASIO4All page. Trust me, this is a lifesaver. The default Microsoft USB drivers will result in earth-shattering white noise from your condenser microphone with many of Behringer&apos;s USB interfaces, particularly the UM2 and some others with Xenyx preamps. Aslo, a decent XLR cable will substantially reduce noise. Keep seeding please.\r\n\r\nFrom the Readme:\r\n\r\nBEHRINGER USB AUDIO Driver Win64 2.8.40\r\n---------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n1.
