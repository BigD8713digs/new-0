It is the compelling story of U.S. Air Force Major Joe Mack, a man born out of time. When his experimental aircraft is forced down in Russia and he escapes a Soviet prison camp, he must call upon the ancient skills of his Indian forebears to survive the vast Siberian wilderness. Only one route lies open to Mack: the path of his ancestors, overland to the Bering Strait and across the sea to America. But in pursuit is a legendary tracker, the Yakut native Alekhin, who knows every square foot of the icy frontier - and who knows that to trap his quarry he must think like a Sioux.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-01-18T19:00:37.752Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:d14074cffb1175ff46ed471b585ce63834250a36","dn":"Last of the Breed by Louis L'Amour EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"d14074cffb1175ff46ed471b585ce63834250a36","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,64,116,207,251,17,117,255,70,237,71,27,88,92,230,56,52,37,10,54]},"name":"Last of the Breed by Louis L'Amour EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
