But by itself, DNA is just an inert blueprint for life. It is the ribosome-an enormous molecular machine made up of a million atoms-that makes DNA come to life, turning our genetic code into proteins and therefore into us. Gene Machine is an insider account of the race for the structure of the ribosome, a fundamental discovery that both advances our knowledge of all life and could lead to the development of better antibiotics against life-threatening diseases. But this is also a human story of Ramakrishnan&apos;s unlikely journey, from his first fumbling experiments in a biology lab to being the dark horse in a fierce competition with some of the world&apos;s best scientists. In the end, Gene Machine is a frank insider&apos;s account of the pursuit of high-stakes science.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\nForeword by Jennifer Doudna ix\r\nPrologue xi\r\nCHAPTER 1 An Unexpected Change of Plans in America 1\r\nCHAPTER 2 Stumbling into the Ribosome 9\r\nCHAPTER 3 Seeing the Invisible 27\r\nCHAPTER 4 The First Crystals of the Machine 41\r\nCHAPTER 5 Going to the Mecca of Crystallography 57\r\nCHAPTER 6 Emerging from the Primordial Mist 71\r\nCHAPTER 7 A Threshold Is Crossed 81\r\nCHAPTER 8 The Race Begins 95\r\nCHAPTER 9 Getting Started in Utah 107\r\nCHAPTER 10 A Return to Mecca 123\r\nCHAPTER 11 Coming Out of the Closet 135\r\nCHAPTER 12 Almost Missing the Boat 147\r\nCHAPTER 13 The Final Assault 163\r\nCHAPTER 14 Seeing the New Continent 177\r\nCHAPTER 15 The Politics of Recognition 187\r\nCHAPTER 16 The Ribosome Road Show 197\r\nCHAPTER 17 The Movie Emerges 211\r\nCHAPTER 18 The Phone Call in October 227\r\nCHAPTER 19 A Week in Stockholm 239\r\nCHAPTER 20 Science Marches On 249\r\nEPILOGUE 257\r\nAcknowledgements 265\r\nNotes and Suggested Reading 267\r\n <a href=\"\nhttps://i.postimg.cc/1XXGSgM9/Gene_Machine_-_The_Race_to_Decipher_the_Secrets_of_the_Ribosome.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://i.postimg.cc/1XXGSgM9/Gene_Machine_-_The_Race_to_Decipher_the_Secrets_of_the_Ribosome.jpg</a>","last_updated":"2018-09-22T12:07:50.346Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:034e9558c5e109ab586239b03dc367cc922f5739","dn":"Gene Machine - The Race to Decipher the Secrets of the Ribosome ","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"034e9558c5e109ab586239b03dc367cc922f5739","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,78,149,88,197,225,9,171,88,98,57,176,61,195,103,204,146,47,87,57]},"name":"Gene Machine - The Race to Decipher the Secrets of the Ribosome ","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
