Initially an experimental electronic outfit, the group signed to Virgin Records in 1979 and later attained widespread commercial success with their third album Dare in 1981. The only constant band member since 1977 has been lead singer and songwriter Philip Oakey. Keyboard players Martyn Ware and Ian Craig Marsh both left the band in 1980 to form Heaven 17. Under Oakey&apos;s leadership, The Human League then evolved into a commercially successful New Pop band with a new line-up including female vocalists Joanne Catherall and Susan Ann Sulley. Since the mid-1990s, the band has essentially been a trio of Oakey, Catherall and Sulley.\r\nThe Human League Live at the Dome is a live concert performance released on DVD by the British group The Human League, recorded on 19 December 2003 at the Brighton Dome (the closing night of their 2003 tour). It was commissioned by the band themselves due to the success of Virgin Records&apos; The Very Best of the Human League DVD the previous year; and the high uptake for their live concerts. Also included is an interview of the band&apos;s principal members Philip Oakey, Susan Ann Sulley and Joanne Catherall filmed at HL Studios, Sheffield, conducted by &apos;Jet&apos; Martin Celmins.\r\n\r\nYear of release: 2003\r\nCountry: England\r\nGenre: Synth-pop, New Wave\r\nDuration: 01:35:24\r\nLabel: Secret Films/Music Video Distributors\r\nQuality: DVD9\r\nFormat: DVD Video\r\nVideo codec: MPEG2\r\nAudio Codec: AC3\r\nVideo: PAL 16: 9 (720x576) VBR Auto Pan &amp; Scan\r\nAudio: English (Dolby AC3, 6 ch + 2 ch)\r\n\r\nTracklist:\r\n01.
