In the summer of 1928, sixteen-year-old Minka was looking forward to a sewing class picnic. This would be a rare chance to put aside farm chores, don a pretty dress, and enjoy an outing with other girls. It would be a day to remember. And it was - but not in the way Minka had dreamed. Cornered by a stranger in the woods, the young girl was assaulted. Minka still believed that the stork brought babies; she would not discover for months that she was pregnant. The story that follows has been almost a hundred years in the making. What happens when a new mother must make a heartbreaking sacrifice to give her baby daughter the life she deserves? Can her cherished memories carry her through decades of turmoil, during a rapidly changing time in American history? And in the end, can she trust God for a miracle? The Waiting is an unforgettable true story of faith that triumphs, forgiveness that sets us free, and love that never forgets.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-06-16T12:12:06.969Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:99de8c1d196ea3ca5bf299c8d898675d2d2a8601","dn":"The Waiting by Cathy LaGrow EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"99de8c1d196ea3ca5bf299c8d898675d2d2a8601","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,222,140,29,25,110,163,202,91,242,153,200,216,152,103,93,45,42,134,1]},"name":"The Waiting by Cathy LaGrow EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
