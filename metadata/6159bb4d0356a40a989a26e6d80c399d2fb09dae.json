As things gets desperate for the survivors and all hope seems lost, Sonic appears, having answered Tails&apos; emergency call, and makes short work of the invading Egg Pawns before challenging Dr. Eggman. Eggman however, having anticipated this, has a surprise up his sleeve. Sonic promptly finds his way blocked by none other than Shadow, Metal Sonic, Zavok, and Chaos, who are now serving under Eggman. Among Eggman&apos;s henchmen is also a newcomer: an enigmatic and powerful being named Infinite, who acts as Dr. Eggman&apos;s right-hand man and the leader of the Eggman Army. Sonic tries to fight Infinite, but is easy swept aside by the newcomer&apos;s mysterious power. Tails, unable to help or figure out Infinite&apos;s power, can only watch as Sonic gets defeated and captured by Infinite and his allies","last_updated":"2017-12-19T12:01:37.899Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:6159bb4d0356a40a989a26e6d80c399d2fb09dae","dn":"SonicForces.STEAMPUNKS","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"6159bb4d0356a40a989a26e6d80c399d2fb09dae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,89,187,77,3,86,164,10,152,154,38,230,216,12,57,157,47,176,157,174]},"name":"SonicForces.STEAMPUNKS","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
