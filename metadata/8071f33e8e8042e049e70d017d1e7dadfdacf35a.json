Ganesha is just like any other kid, except that he has the head of an elephant and rides around on a magical mouse. And he loves sweets, especially the traditional dessert laddoo. But when Ganesha insists on biting into a super jumbo jawbreaker laddoo, his tusk breaks off! Ganesha is terribly upset, but with the help of the wise poet Vyasa, and his friend Mr. Mouse, he learns that what seems broken can actually be quite useful after all. With vibrant, graphic illustrations, expressive characters, and offbeat humor, this is a wonderfully inventive rendition of a classic tale.\r\n\r\nReading level: 5 - 8 years\r\nHardcover: 40 pages\r\nPublisher: Chronicle Books (19 September 2012)\r\nLanguage: English\r\nISBN-10: 1452103623\r\nISBN-13: 978-1452103624","last_updated":"2017-09-18T12:07:29.811Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:8071f33e8e8042e049e70d017d1e7dadfdacf35a","dn":"Ganesha's Sweet Tooth 2012 by Emily Haynes, Sanjay Patel ","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"8071f33e8e8042e049e70d017d1e7dadfdacf35a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,113,243,62,142,128,66,224,73,231,13,1,125,30,125,173,253,172,243,90]},"name":"Ganesha's Sweet Tooth 2012 by Emily Haynes, Sanjay Patel ","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
