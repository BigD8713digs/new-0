Surrounded by acolytes of the free market, the true believers, the US Marines of capitalism - &quot;the few, the proud, the completely full of themselves&quot; - Bryan soon realizes that being honest at a dishonest job is not the path to success. He decides to give Wall Street a taste of its own medicine and hatches an intricate plan to disappear permanently with just enough misappropriated money - and sailing classes - to spend his golden years cruising the Caribbean. \r\n\r\nBryan quickly learns that being a criminal, even a really smart one, is more complicated than he thought. He finds himself on the run in the Cayman Islands, wanted for murder. On his trail is an irresponsible team of investigators sent by his Wall Street firm, hellbent on reclaiming the millions before their clients notice it&apos;s missing: his boss, Seo-yun Kim, who&apos;s committed to not only clearing her name but escaping her suffocating fiance and their pending nuptials; the investment bank&apos;s collections agent, Neal Nathanson, depressed over a recent break-up with his boyfriend; and an ex-cop from Cura&#xE7;ao, Piet Room, who has traded in his badge for spouse spying as a private investigator. Their efforts are complicated by an Australian sailor begrudgingly circumnavigating the globe to fundraise for breast cancer awareness.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-06-14T12:15:20.565Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:0038682ebbc902c7f50a9969c29da275ee44675b","dn":"Blown by Mark Haskell Smith EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"0038682ebbc902c7f50a9969c29da275ee44675b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,56,104,46,187,201,2,199,245,10,153,105,194,157,162,117,238,68,103,91]},"name":"Blown by Mark Haskell Smith EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
