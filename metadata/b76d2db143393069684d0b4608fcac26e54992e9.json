Told through the fascinating, complex, and often flawed characters who created a new era, it begins as the &apos;60s are ending, with the rise of the conglomerates, those vast assemblages of corporate assets. It rolls through the crisis-wracked &apos;70s and the birth of the hostile deal then careens into the &apos;80s, when the deal culture of mergers and acquisitions is truly unleashed. The &apos;90s see backlash, retrenchment, and rethinking. The new century brings bubbles and deregulation, ending in disaster. And following a quiet period after the financial crash of 2008, we are witnessing the full-throated battle once again.\r\n\r\nSince the first hostile deal in 1975, mergers and acquisitions have set off a revolution in who controls and governs American corporations. The rise of the deal raiders ushered in a world where literally no company was safe. Year after year, blockbuster deals unfolded. Many were hostile, most were complicated, and the majority were dead on arrival. Together they tell a story about money and power and the creation of a new era in business.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-12-10T12:06:46.263Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:b76d2db143393069684d0b4608fcac26e54992e9","dn":"Bloodsport by Robert Teitelman EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"b76d2db143393069684d0b4608fcac26e54992e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,109,45,177,67,57,48,105,104,77,11,70,8,252,172,38,229,73,146,233]},"name":"Bloodsport by Robert Teitelman EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
