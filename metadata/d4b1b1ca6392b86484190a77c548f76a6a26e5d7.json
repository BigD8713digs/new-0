This book&#x2013;&#x2013;at its core&#x2013;&#x2013;is not about immigration at all. This book is about homelessness, not in a traditional sense, but in the unsettled, unmoored psychological state that undocumented immigrants like myself find ourselves in. This book is about lying and being forced to lie to get by; about passing as an American and as a contributing citizen; about families, keeping them together, and having to make new ones when you can&#x2019;t. This book is about constantly hiding from the government and, in the process, hiding from ourselves. This book is about what it means to not have a home.\r\nAfter 25 years of living illegally in a country that does not consider me one of its own, this book is the closest thing I have to freedom.&#x201D;\r\n\r\nGenre: Non-Fiction &gt; Autobiography &gt; Memoir","last_updated":"2018-09-18T12:06:19.809Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:d4b1b1ca6392b86484190a77c548f76a6a26e5d7","dn":"Dear America by Jose Antonio Vargas (.epub)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"d4b1b1ca6392b86484190a77c548f76a6a26e5d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,177,177,202,99,146,184,100,132,25,10,119,197,72,247,106,106,38,229,215]},"name":"Dear America by Jose Antonio Vargas (.epub)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
