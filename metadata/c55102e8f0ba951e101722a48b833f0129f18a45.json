It&apos;s Me, Margaret by Judy Blume EPUB\r\n\r\nMargaret Simon, almost 12, likes long hair, tuna fish, the smell of rain, and things that are pink. She&apos;s just moved from New York City to Farbrook, New Jersey, and is anxious to fit in with her new friends - Nancy, Gretchen, and Janie. When they form a secret club to talk about private subjects like boys, bras, and getting their first periods, Margaret is happy to belong.\r\n\r\nBut none of them can believe Margaret doesn&apos;t have a religion, and that she isn&apos;t joining the Y or the Jewish Community Center. What they don&apos;t know is that Margaret has her own special relationship with God. She can talk to God about everything - family, friends, even Philip Leroy, the best-looking boy in sixth grade.\r\n\r\nMargaret is funny and real. As you read her story, you&apos;ll know why this book has been the favorite of millions of readers. It&apos;s as if Margaret is talking right to you, sharing her secrets with a friend.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-12-30T12:03:22.333Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:c55102e8f0ba951e101722a48b833f0129f18a45","dn":"Are You There God ..
