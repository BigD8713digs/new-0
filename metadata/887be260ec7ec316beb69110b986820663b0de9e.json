From the pre-Socratic philosophers through the celebrated days of Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle, up to Renaissance visionaries like Erasmus and Bacon, philosophy emerges here as a phenomenon unconfined by any one discipline. Indeed, as Gottlieb explains, its most revolutionary breakthroughs in the natural and social sciences have repeatedly been co-opted by other branches of knowledge, leading to the illusion that philosophers never make any progress.\r\n\r\nFrom the physics of angels to Umberto Eco&apos;s The Name of the Rose, Gottlieb builds through example and anecdote a vivid portrait of the human drive for understanding. After finishing The Dream of Reason, readers will be graced with a fresh appreciation of the philosophical quest, its entertaining and bizarre byways, and its influence on every aspect of life.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-09-05T12:00:28.801Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:887be260ec7ec316beb69110b986820663b0de9e","dn":"The Dream of Reason_ A History of Philosophy from the Greeks to ","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"887be260ec7ec316beb69110b986820663b0de9e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,123,226,96,236,126,195,22,190,182,145,16,185,134,130,6,99,176,222,158]},"name":"The Dream of Reason_ A History of Philosophy from the Greeks to ","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
