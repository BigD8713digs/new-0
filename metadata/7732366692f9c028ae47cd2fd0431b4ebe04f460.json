Ramshackled, White&apos;s only solo album, was far from a huge seller, but some Yes fans bought it out of curiosity. Many of them were no doubt expecting to hear progressive rock, but this out of print LP is a long way from Relayer or Tales from Topographic Oceans. Instead, White turns his attention to blue-eyed soul-pop and, to a lesser degree, jazz fusion with erratic results. While the singing is unimpressive, some of the material is OK. &quot;One Way Rag,&quot; &quot;Giddy,&quot; and &quot;Ooooh Baby&quot; have more in common with Van Morrison than with Yes, King Crimson, or Genesis, and the jazz fusion instrumental &quot;Avakak&quot; might have worked on a CTI session of the early to mid-&apos;70s. Meanwhile, the most embarrassing tune on the album is &quot;Silly Woman,&quot; a painfully square and downright corny attempt at reggae or Caribbean music. Although Ramshackled isn&apos;t terrible, most of the Yes fans who bought it agreed that their money hadn&apos;t been well spent. The LP soon ended up in the cutout bins, and White&apos;s attempt at solo career died a quick death. - Alex Henderson, AMG","last_updated":"2017-06-11T12:02:13.793Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:7732366692f9c028ae47cd2fd0431b4ebe04f460","dn":"Alan White 1976 Ramshackled (vinyl)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"7732366692f9c028ae47cd2fd0431b4ebe04f460","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,50,54,102,146,249,192,40,174,71,205,47,208,67,27,78,190,4,244,96]},"name":"Alan White 1976 Ramshackled (vinyl)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
