To help you protect yourself and your computer, this updated edition of Steal This Computer Book guides you through the attacks you face on the Internet and reveals the tricks hackers could be using on you right now.\r\n\r\nSteal This Computer Book 4.0: What They Won&apos;t Tell You About the Internet\r\n <a href=\"\nhttps://extraimage.net/images/2017/12/20/eedbcbb8577703625285904369057270.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://extraimage.net/images/2017/12/20/eedbcbb8577703625285904369057270.jpg</a>\r\n\r\nThe completely revised fourth edition of this offbeat, non-technical book examines what hackers do, how they do it, and how you can protect yourself. Written in the same informative, irreverent, and entertaining style that made the first three editions hugely successful, Steal This Computer Book 4.0 will expand your mind and raise your eyebrows. New chapters discuss the hacker mentality, social engineering and lock picking, exploiting P2P file-sharing networks, and how people manipulate search engines and pop-up ads to obtain and use personal information. Wang also takes issue with the media for &quot;hacking&quot; the news and presenting the public with self-serving stories of questionable accuracy.\r\n\r\nInside, you&#x2019;ll discover:\r\n&#x2013;How to manage and fight spam and spyware\r\n&#x2013;How Trojan horse programs and rootkits work and how to defend against them\r\n&#x2013;How hackers steal software and defeat copy-protection mechanisms\r\n&#x2013;How to tell if your machine is being attacked and what you can do to protect it\r\n&#x2013;Where the hackers are, how they probe a target and sneak into a computer, and what they do once they get inside\r\n&#x2013;How corporations use hacker techniques to infect your computer and invade your privacy\r\n\r\nIf you&#x2019;ve ever logged onto a website, conducted an online transaction, sent or received email, used a networked computer or even watched the evening news, you may have already been tricked, tracked, hacked, and manipulated. As the saying goes, just because you&#x2019;re paranoid doesn&#x2019;t mean they aren&#x2019;t after you.\r\n\r\nGenre: Privacy &amp; Online Safety, Hacking, Network Security, Viruses\r\nPublisher: No Starch Press\r\nLanguage: English\r\nFormat: PDF","last_updated":"2017-12-20T12:08:00.575Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:dee84463de9ea646e2e9cde7c3b68f3fe4287066","dn":"Wallace Wang - Steal This Computer Book 2 and 4 (pdf)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"dee84463de9ea646e2e9cde7c3b68f3fe4287066","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,232,68,99,222,158,166,70,226,233,205,231,195,182,143,63,228,40,112,102]},"name":"Wallace Wang - Steal This Computer Book 2 and 4 (pdf)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
