Succeeding See by some two years, it shares that album&apos;s aesthetics and approach -- an economy of means, and superior song-writing/playing -- even when compared to their earlier albums. One wouldn&apos;t guess it was recorded live at a gig in Breisgau, because the sound is, quite honestly, superlative, and is even better than any of their studio albums. The original, mono recordings (by Volkmar Miedtke) were meticulously reprocessed into stereo years later by Udi Koomran, and the sound has really been, &apos;opened up&apos;. The playing itself is also powerful and thoughtful. Especially important is the fact that only two of the twenty songs on this disc were released on previous albums, thus making The Work&apos;s entire catalog finally complete, and now wholly in print. - forcedexposure.com","last_updated":"2017-06-10T12:01:00.677Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:3661ba75b41cbb7c7815855c536294c1ff5d08f0","dn":"The Work 1994 The 4th World","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"3661ba75b41cbb7c7815855c536294c1ff5d08f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,97,186,117,180,28,187,124,120,21,133,92,83,98,148,193,255,93,8,240]},"name":"The Work 1994 The 4th World","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
