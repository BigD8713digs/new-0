Orbiter is a simulator that gives you an idea what space flight really feels like - today and in the not so distant future. And best of al\r\nAfter installing the core package (and making sure that it runs without problems on your computer), you can add optional features such as high resolution planetary textures or essential 3rd party addons.\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n\r\nTo run Orbiter, you need a Windows PC with at least 4GB of memory. The basic installation requires about 3 GB of space on the hard disk, but additional texture packs can take up significantly more space. A fast graphics card is recommended. Orbiter can be controlled via the keyboard, but a joystick is useful for atmospheric flight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOptional high-resolution texture download\r\n\r\nAfter installing the core package (and ensuring that it runs without problems on your computer), you can install high-resolution replacements of the default textures for some of the planets and moons. This will improve the visual appearance in many situations, but requires more computing power and a lot of hard disk space","last_updated":"2017-09-15T12:04:00.998Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:c364f48651fddc4f5eade0111f3c8b7006d352e7","dn":"Orbiter Solaar System Full","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"c364f48651fddc4f5eade0111f3c8b7006d352e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,100,244,134,81,253,220,79,94,173,224,17,31,60,139,112,6,211,82,231]},"name":"Orbiter Solaar System Full","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
