We can tell a story or even tell a joke. But put us on a platform and we can feel very different. When we speak to an audience, we often put on a public mask; and use a different voice. Why can&apos;t we seem to be ourselves when we give a talk?\r\n\r\nIn this book, we will look at all aspects of spoken communication, from structure right through to delivery. We will learn how to have a conversation with our audience - to be ourselves - so that we connect with them every time we speak. In seven simple steps, you can learn to be a confident and authentic public speaker. There are specific exercises at the end of every section for you to practice.\r\n\r\nWhether you&apos;re a CEO presenting to shareholders, a manager motivating your team, an entrepreneur selling a business, a creative pitching an idea, a charity worker asking for donations, or a parent speaking at your daughter&apos;s wedding, this book will help you become a confident and authentic public speaker &#x2013; so that when you speak, your audience will listen.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-09-26T12:03:40.513Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b16d081dff9ccc2c009de163b2b2222d7be9644","dn":"Speak So Your Audience Will Listen_ 7 steps to Confident and Aut","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"9b16d081dff9ccc2c009de163b2b2222d7be9644","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,22,208,129,223,249,204,194,192,9,222,22,59,43,34,34,215,190,150,68]},"name":"Speak So Your Audience Will Listen_ 7 steps to Confident and Aut","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
