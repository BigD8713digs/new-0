Virtual Surround is a technology which allows you to listen to music, watch movies, or play video games with surround effects using any set of two channel stereo headphones. The sources of this release are surround versions of the tracks (DTS 5.1) ripped from the DVD which was released in 2006. I&apos;ve converted them to virtual surround with Creative&apos;s BlasterX Acoustic Engine Pro. Using state-of-the-art technology, it gives an enhanced virtual 7.1 channel surround sound experience with regular stereo headphones.\r\n\r\nGenre: Electronic\r\nStyle: Glitch, Abstract, IDM, Downtempo, Ambient\r\nRelease Date: August 29, 2006\r\nLabel: DTS Entertainment - 1140\r\nSource: DVD DTS 48/24 5.1\r\nResampler: Adobe Audition\r\nSample rate: 44100 Hz\r\nBits per sample: 16\r\nCodec: FLAC\r\n\r\nThis Binary Universe is the fifth studio album by composer and electronica artist BT. The album was a significant about-face for Transeau, largely abandoning the progressive trance music he was known for, in favor of ambient soundscapes, live orchestration and glitch music. It is the first BT album not to be released on vinyl, nor feature any singles (though an edit of &quot;1.618&quot; was featured on a compilation). The album was also composed specifically for DTS 5.1 surround sound. A film version of the album received a limited theatrical run, usually accompanied by appearances by Transeau himself. The album is dedicated to Transeau&apos;s daughter, Kaia.\r\n\r\n\r\nTracklist:\r\n\r\n01. All That Makes Us Human Continues (8:20)\r\n02. Dynamic Symmetry (11:26)\r\n03.
