But after the death of his longtime mistress, Sabbath embarks on a turbulent journey into his past. Haunted by the ghosts of all the people who loved and hated him the most, Sabbath contrives a succession of farcical disasters that take him to the brink of madness and extinction. Acclaimed author Philip Roth is at the very peak of his creative powers in this bold and hilarious novel, a comic creation of epic proportions.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-07-08T12:00:20.937Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b8bf53d5c24143f0f2343abb2030ca5b15398c7","dn":"Sabbath's Theater by Philip Roth epub RtR","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"3b8bf53d5c24143f0f2343abb2030ca5b15398c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,139,245,61,92,36,20,63,15,35,67,171,178,3,12,165,177,83,152,199]},"name":"Sabbath's Theater by Philip Roth epub RtR","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
