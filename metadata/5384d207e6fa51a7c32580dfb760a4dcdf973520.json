While I may be novice to &#x201C;Initial-seeding,&#x201D; in the past I just leeched and then removed the file. I understand, some people aren&#x2019;t able to seed beyond the completion of their download.\r\n\r\nI&#x2019;m doing my best though and absolutely appreciate those who understand torrenting, the important use of VPNs, and anybody who has the ability to re-seed what they download, at-least 3 times before removing the file from their software.\r\n\r\nThe &#x201C;grunt&#x201D; work to record/capture on-demand content, (splice &#x201C;breaks&#x201D; trim, convert and re-encode and down-convert) can be time consuming. It&#x2019;s not a gripe but to those who do it and provide this stuff, I truly appreciate it now, more so, than ever before. Thank You!! :)\r\n\r\nIf you experience Audio/Video issues: Understand that this stuff isn&#x2019;t always perfect and any compressed media format may suffer issues with audio/video sync from time to time and in the end, it depends on your video software, decoder, or hardware. Most have the ability to auto sync or allow for manually adjusting the audio by +/- 0-5 ms. Using wireless or Bluetooth for any audio delivery (even Cable/Satellite Set-top boxes) will cause a slight lag without having &#x201C;aptX&#x201D; enabled. Some hardware doesn&#x2019;t support aptX.\r\n\r\nOne more thing:\r\n\r\nIf you find a dead torrent that was uploaded by me, just comment or e-mail me: jt057041 at gmail dot com. I don&#x2019;t have issues re-seeding. I will reply with a .torrent file, magnet link or info hash. (My initial tag was guw but going forward is now jgm). \r\n\r\nThanks for reading this information and please keep these files and Public Torrents alive.\r\n\r\nIf any content in this info inadvertently violates a TOS of TPB, I apologize. \r\nTrackers are added to get the torrent to seeders and other torrent search engines as an effort to be transparent","last_updated":"2017-08-07T12:05:28.966Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:5384d207e6fa51a7c32580dfb760a4dcdf973520","dn":"The.Nineties.Part.5.Terrorism.Hits.Home.720p.h264.(jgm).mkv","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"5384d207e6fa51a7c32580dfb760a4dcdf973520","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,132,210,7,230,250,81,167,195,37,128,223,183,96,164,220,223,151,53,32]},"name":"The.Nineties.Part.5.Terrorism.Hits.Home.720p.h264.(jgm).mkv","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
