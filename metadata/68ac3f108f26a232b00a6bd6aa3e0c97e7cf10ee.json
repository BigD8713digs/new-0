He educated millions of readers about the origins of the universe and the nature of black holes, and inspired millions more by defying a terrifying early prognosis of ALS, which originally gave him only two years to live. In later life he could communicate only by using a few facial muscles, but he continued to advance his field and serve as a revered voice on social and humanitarian issues.\r\n\r\nGenre: Non-Fiction &gt; Educational &gt; Astrophysics &amp; Space Science","last_updated":"2018-10-16T12:23:53.785Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:68ac3f108f26a232b00a6bd6aa3e0c97e7cf10ee","dn":"Brief Answers to the Big Questions by Stephen Hawking (.epub)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"68ac3f108f26a232b00a6bd6aa3e0c97e7cf10ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,172,63,16,143,38,162,50,176,10,107,214,170,62,12,151,231,207,16,238]},"name":"Brief Answers to the Big Questions by Stephen Hawking (.epub)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
