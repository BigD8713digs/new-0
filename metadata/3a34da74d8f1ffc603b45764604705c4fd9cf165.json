Readers will find heartwarming and triumphant stories that point to dogs&apos; characteristic resilience and unconditional love. Her subjects include puppies, adult dogs, and special needs dogs-of all breeds, and of course, mixed breeds-and her stories will empower readers to join the rescue effort or bolster their efforts to increase their volunteer involvement to better the lives of rescue dogs, one animal at a time","last_updated":"2017-08-26T12:00:45.232Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a34da74d8f1ffc603b45764604705c4fd9cf165","dn":"Rescue Dogs: Portraits and Stories(2017) - EPUB - zeke23","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"3a34da74d8f1ffc603b45764604705c4fd9cf165","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,52,218,116,216,241,255,198,3,180,87,100,96,71,5,196,253,156,241,101]},"name":"Rescue Dogs: Portraits and Stories(2017) - EPUB - zeke23","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
