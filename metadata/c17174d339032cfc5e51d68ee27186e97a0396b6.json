PlayStation: The Official Magazine was published 13 times a year by Future plc until its cancellation in late 2012.\r\n\r\nPSM&apos;s UK-based sister magazine, PSM3, was another Future publication.\r\nPrior to becoming the official magazine, PSM was an independently published video game magazine specializing in all Sony PlayStation-brand video game consoles and handheld gaming platforms. PSM was published by Future, who also publishes PlayStation Official Magazine.\r\n\r\nThe magazine launched with the September 1997 issue, which featured Final Fantasy VII on the cover. During its publication, it consistently outsold every other PlayStation-dedicated magazine both in the United States and abroad (according to independent ABC audits).[citation needed]\r\n\r\nPSM celebrated ten years of publication with its 2007 issue. By this time, the magazine had been through several redesigns, most recently with its June 2006 issue. Also over its history, the magazine had sponsored side content such as cover-mounted DVDs, websites, online forums, and near the end, a PSM podcast\r\n[IMG]https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f2/PlayStation_The_Official_Magazine_logo.png[/IMG]","last_updated":"2017-06-08T12:00:25.170Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:c17174d339032cfc5e51d68ee27186e97a0396b6","dn":"PlayStation Official Magazine UK - Issue 137 - July 2017 - True ","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"c17174d339032cfc5e51d68ee27186e97a0396b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,113,116,211,57,3,44,252,94,81,214,142,226,113,134,233,122,3,150,182]},"name":"PlayStation Official Magazine UK - Issue 137 - July 2017 - True ","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
