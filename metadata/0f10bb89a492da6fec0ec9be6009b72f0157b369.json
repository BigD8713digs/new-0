In the fifth century, the future of Britain hung in the balance; after four centuries of straight roads and hot and cold running water the Romans upped and left, called back to support their own ailing Empire. The country quickly descended into chaos, plunging the native population into poverty and instability as their livelihoods - many dependent on the Romans - disappeared almost overnight. The nation was vulnerable and it didn&apos;t take long for Anglo-Saxon invaders to take advantage; a vast bloodthirsty army quickly overran the country, killing the locals and settling down to change the history of the British Isles forever.\r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC High L3.1\r\n * Video Bitrate: CRF 19 (~3070Kbps)\r\n * Video Resolution: 1280x720\r\n * Frame Rate: 25 FPS\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC-LC\r\n * Audio Bitrate: Q=0.45 VBR 48KHz (~128Kbps)\r\n * Audio Channels: 2\r\n * Run-Time: 59 mins\r\n * Part Size: 1.32 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Subtitles: Merged","last_updated":"2018-09-17T12:23:00.168Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f10bb89a492da6fec0ec9be6009b72f0157b369","dn":"BBC King Arthurs Britain 720p x264 AAC HDTV ","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"0f10bb89a492da6fec0ec9be6009b72f0157b369","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,16,187,137,164,146,218,111,236,14,201,190,96,9,183,47,1,87,179,105]},"name":"BBC King Arthurs Britain 720p x264 AAC HDTV ","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
