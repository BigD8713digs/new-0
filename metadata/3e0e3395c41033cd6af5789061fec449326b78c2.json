At the time, China&apos;s &apos;one-child policy&apos; banned parents from having a second baby and many were abandoned. Kati&apos;s parents left a note with their daughter asking whoever raised her to bring her back to meet them at the &apos;Broken Bridge in Hangzhou&apos; at a set date in the future. Kati was adopted by an American family and moved to the USA. Over twenty years later, she returns to China to meet her birth parents.\r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC High L3.1\r\n * Video Bitrate: CRF 20 (~2215Kbps)\r\n * Video Resolution: 1280x656\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.95:1\r\n * Frame Rate: 25 FPS\r\n * Audio Codec: HE-AAC\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 64Kbps CBR 24KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: 2\r\n * Run-Time: 23 mins\r\n * Number of Parts: 1\r\n * Part Size: 371 MB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Subtitles: Merged","last_updated":"2017-12-10T12:03:39.832Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e0e3395c41033cd6af5789061fec449326b78c2","dn":"BBC Our World 2017 The Return 720p x264 AAC HDTV ","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"3e0e3395c41033cd6af5789061fec449326b78c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,14,51,149,196,16,51,205,106,245,120,144,97,254,196,73,50,107,120,194]},"name":"BBC Our World 2017 The Return 720p x264 AAC HDTV ","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
