These, coupled with his own detailed knowledge of the ground, enable the Author to paint the most accurate picture yet of this cataclysmic battle that so shamed the British establishment.\r\n\r\nWe learn for the first time of the complex Zulu decoy, the dishonorable attempt to blame Colonel Durnford for the defeat, evidence of another &#x2018;fugitives&#x2019; trail&#x2019;. The identity of previously unknown escorts for Lts Coghill and Melville, both awarded VCs for trying to save the Colors.\r\n\r\nIsandlwana is a brilliant and fresh account of this most famous battle which will fascinate experts and laymen alike","last_updated":"2017-05-24T11:45:48.407Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ae5bbfd6284f387f159682585f2fdad997c42a9","dn":"Isandlwana: How the Zulus Humbled the British Empire","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"5ae5bbfd6284f387f159682585f2fdad997c42a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,229,187,253,98,132,243,135,241,89,104,37,133,242,253,173,153,124,66,169]},"name":"Isandlwana: How the Zulus Humbled the British Empire","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
