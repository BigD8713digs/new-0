England\r\nAlpha | October 2016 | ISBN: 1465453490, 9781465453495 | 194 Pages | True PDF | 33.2 mb\r\n\r\nCooking Sous Vide is an approachable guide to the techniques involved in cooking sous vide. Sous Vide (which is French for &quot;under vacuum&quot;) is the process of cooking foods, like meats and vegetables, in sealed bags submerged in a water bath that is maintained at a constant temperature.\r\nThe result is food that is cooked nearly perfectly because of precise temperature control that virtually eliminates the possibility of over- or under-cooking food. The slow, controlled method of sous vide results in meats and vegetables that have a much more delicate texture than if being cooked at high temperatures.\r\nCooking Sous Vide covers the basics of how sous vide works, buying the right equipment, how to season sous vide foods, and how to cook sous vide safely while achieving optimum results. Over 70 recipes, many with beautiful color photos of the finished dish, will be featured throughout.\r\n\r\nAbout the Author <a href=\"\nhttps://s26.postimg.org/mcgsj5vh5/Thom.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://s26.postimg.org/mcgsj5vh5/Thom.jpg</a>\r\nChef Thom England, as a professional chef, food writer, educator and mentor, has shared his expertise with many aspiring and seasoned chefs for over 20 years.
