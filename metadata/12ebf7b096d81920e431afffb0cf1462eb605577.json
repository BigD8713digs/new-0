Having been captured by the Japanese after the fall of Singapore in 1942, Jim was first sent to work in Burma, to build what has become known as the Death Railway. Unlike many of his comrades, Jim survived this ordeal, only to be transferred to Nagasaki, Japan, where he was sent to work in the mines of Sendryu. \r\n\r\nJim describes how the conditions in the &apos;Hell pits of Sendryu&apos; were even worse than those experienced in Burma, but were ultimately the reason why he survived the war. On the 9th August 1945, the Americans, dropped the second nuclear bomb on Nagaski. Jim was fortunately underground at the time, but through this book re-lives the harrowing aftermath of the attack when the ground shook violently.\r\n\r\nGenre: Non-Fiction &gt; History","last_updated":"2018-09-14T12:25:28.191Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:12ebf7b096d81920e431afffb0cf1462eb605577","dn":"Survival on the Death Railway by Jim Brigginshaw (.epub)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"12ebf7b096d81920e431afffb0cf1462eb605577","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,235,247,176,150,216,25,32,228,49,175,255,176,207,20,98,235,96,85,119]},"name":"Survival on the Death Railway by Jim Brigginshaw (.epub)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
