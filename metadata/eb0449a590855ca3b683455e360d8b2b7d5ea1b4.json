Despite being caught on camera wheeling the money from the vault to the getaway van, David Ghantt makes off to Mexico before the FBI can blink.\r\n\r\nThere&apos;s just one hitch: Ghantt has entrusted the money to an oddball crew of accomplices who had wooed him into committing this massive theft in the first place - and who, he soon learns, are trying to take him out. Now one of the most wanted men in America, and with the FBI hot on his heels, Ghantt must figure out how to get his money, get away from a hit man, and get even.\r\n\r\nIn this outrageously entertaining book, Jeff Diamant, the Charlotte Observer&apos;s lead reporter on the case, offers the definitive inside account of this astonishing true story that has captivated American audiences on the news.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-04-29T12:00:31.894Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb0449a590855ca3b683455e360d8b2b7d5ea1b4","dn":"Heist by Jeff Diamant EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"eb0449a590855ca3b683455e360d8b2b7d5ea1b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,4,73,165,144,133,92,163,182,131,69,94,54,13,139,43,125,94,161,180]},"name":"Heist by Jeff Diamant EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
