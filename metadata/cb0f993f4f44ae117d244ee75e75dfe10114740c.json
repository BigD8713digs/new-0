In New York the trio get by, earning money from fighting and - on Nicolas Mariani&apos;s part - increasingly illicit activity.\r\n\r\nLucia has ambitions of becoming an actress, and, following a fight that goes horribly wrong, the three of them head to Los Angeles, the city of dreams. Beneath the glitzy fa&#xE7;ade of 1940s Hollywood lies a world of corruption and organised crime, and it isn&apos;t long before Nicholas becomes entangled in it. As Lucia and McCabe&apos;s feelings for each other grow, McCabe is desperate to bury the dark secret of his past while Lucia is torn between her loyalty to her brother and her loyalty to the man she loves.\r\n\r\nFrom the author of A Quiet Belief in Angels comes an epic new novel that spans the golden age of Hollywood, from the 1930s to the 1960s, and includes appearances from Raymond Chandler, William Faulkner, Mickey Cohen and F. Scott Fitzgerald.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-07-09T12:00:38.688Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb0f993f4f44ae117d244ee75e75dfe10114740c","dn":"Kings of America by R J Ellory ePUB eBOOK-ZAK","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"cb0f993f4f44ae117d244ee75e75dfe10114740c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,15,153,63,79,68,174,17,125,36,78,231,94,117,223,225,1,20,116,12]},"name":"Kings of America by R J Ellory ePUB eBOOK-ZAK","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
