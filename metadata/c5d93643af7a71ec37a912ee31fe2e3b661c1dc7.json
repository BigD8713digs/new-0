Churchill&apos;s schooldays are undistinguished, but he is admitted to Sandhurst and embarks on a career as a soldier and a war correspondent, seeing action in Cuba, in India, in the Sudan - where he took part in the battle of Omdurman, of which he gives us a stirring account - and finally in South Africa.\r\n\r\nTaken prisoner by the Boers, Churchill makes a daring escape. Back home he embarks on the political career that is to make him one of Britain&apos;s most distinguished parliamentarians.\r\n\r\nFirst published in 1930, when Churchill&apos;s most testing time still lay ahead of him, My Early Life is memorable both as an adventure-story and as an account of the events and influences that helped to shape the career of a great Englishman.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-03-29T12:01:04.551Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:c5d93643af7a71ec37a912ee31fe2e3b661c1dc7","dn":"My Early Life by Winston Churchill EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"c5d93643af7a71ec37a912ee31fe2e3b661c1dc7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,217,54,67,175,122,113,236,55,169,18,238,49,254,46,59,102,28,29,199]},"name":"My Early Life by Winston Churchill EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
