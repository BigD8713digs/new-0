What, exactly, is being bought and sold is never revealed, yet Sylvian&#x2019;s careful enunciation bristles with implicit violence and desire. Indeed, the Dealer hints early on that there&#x2019;s no single thing under negotiation, murmuring &#x201C;That&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;m approaching you &#x2026;with all the humility of someone with something to offer shows towards someone who might buy&#x201D;, articulating a mutual process of attraction that plays out a mechanics of power and submission into whose gravitational pull both parties are drawn. Threaded within and throughout the near-whispers is Davies and Wastell&#x2019;s muted sound palette, the hazy drifts of percussion, harp and radio casting Sylvian&#x2019;s voice into eerie relief. Occasionally, a chime calls out through the gloom like the cry of a dying, far away star. Pinprick skitters (courtesy of some no-input mixer contributions from Toshimaru Nakamura) and fuzzy electronics contribute to the feeling of being in a non-place, a limbo or transitional zone that could be anywhere, nowhere, everywhere, in which the cycles of need and provision repeat in a perpetual, endless transaction. - Paul Margree","last_updated":"2017-06-18T12:01:18.270Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:82651adc93c3dc6df89776214ebbafd508daf2b8","dn":"Rhodri Davies, David Sylvian, Mark Wastell 2017 There Is No Love","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"82651adc93c3dc6df89776214ebbafd508daf2b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,101,26,220,147,195,220,109,248,151,118,33,78,187,175,213,8,218,242,184]},"name":"Rhodri Davies, David Sylvian, Mark Wastell 2017 There Is No Love","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
