Operating in East Africa, the Squadron was involved in almost continuous counter communist terrorist operations over the period 1968 to 1980.\r\n\r\nIn the unstable final stages of British colonial and white rule, the Squadron was never short of action. African nationalist movements, backed by Russia&#x2019;s and China&#x2019;s direct and indirect support posed a constant and deadly threat to the existing regimes. Small highly trained detachments of the SAS with highly developed bush warfare skills proved devastatingly effective and achieved results out of all proportion to their size. Often their enemies believed that they were facing rival factions and turned on each other. The inevitable involvement of African wildlife adds an extra dimension of excitement\r\n\r\nWritten by a seasoned former senior member of C Squadron, Secret SAS Missions in East Africa paints a graphic and thrilling account of their covert operations and the colorful characters that undertook them.\r\n\r\nMike Graham was born in Burnley, Lancashire but brought up in Rhodesia. He was called up for National Service in the Rhodesian Army. After being commissioned as an officer he transferred to the Regular Army and joined the Rhodesian SAS (C Squadron), rising to be Second-in-Command. His and his fellow officers&#x2019; experiences are the subject of this book.\r\n\r\nPrint Length: 208 pages\r\nPublisher: Pen and Sword Military (October 30, 2017)","last_updated":"2018-09-24T12:23:24.660Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:6758717b0451ed51bdefc71dc43093d40512d189","dn":"Secret SAS Missions in Africa 1968-1980","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"6758717b0451ed51bdefc71dc43093d40512d189","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,88,113,123,4,81,237,81,189,239,199,29,196,48,147,212,5,18,209,137]},"name":"Secret SAS Missions in Africa 1968-1980","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
