In a survival situation, you have to learn to be adaptable and take advantage of the food sources that are available. If you aren&apos;t able to catch a fish or shoot a rabbit, consider eating edible insects, such as grasshoppers and ants. You can also eat a variety of plants, though you shouldn&apos;t eat unknown ones without testing them first. Snakes, birds, even mice are potential food sources. Don Mann covers this and more, including harvesting edible plants, building deadfalls and snares, cooking over hot stones, and much more","last_updated":"2018-09-15T12:25:42.984Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:73ca08c8d97dbcc4198fb7bca7a0e606af22376d","dn":"U.S. Navy SEAL Guide to Food and Hunting Secrets  By Don Mann","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"73ca08c8d97dbcc4198fb7bca7a0e606af22376d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,202,8,200,217,125,188,196,25,143,183,188,167,160,230,6,175,34,55,109]},"name":"U.S. Navy SEAL Guide to Food and Hunting Secrets  By Don Mann","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
