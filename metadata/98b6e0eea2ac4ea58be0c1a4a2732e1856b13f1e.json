Now repackaged with a new introduction from bestselling author Hampton Sides to coincide with a major HBO dramatic film of the book, Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee.\r\n\r\nUsing council records, autobiographies, and firsthand descriptions, Brown allows great chiefs and warriors of the Dakota, Ute, Sioux, Cheyenne, and other tribes to tell us in their own words of the series of battles, massacres, and broken treaties that finally left them and their people demoralized and decimated. A unique and disturbing narrative told with force and clarity, Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee changed forever our vision of how the West was won, and lost. It tells a story that should not be forgotten, and so must be retold from time to time.\r\n <a href=\"\nhttps://worldimages.gallery/images/2017/07/03/img.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://worldimages.gallery/images/2017/07/03/img.gif</a>","last_updated":"2018-05-10T12:12:16.882Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:98b6e0eea2ac4ea58be0c1a4a2732e1856b13f1e","dn":"Dee Brown - Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"98b6e0eea2ac4ea58be0c1a4a2732e1856b13f1e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,182,224,238,162,172,78,165,139,224,193,164,162,115,46,24,86,177,63,30]},"name":"Dee Brown - Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
