As outside forces conspire to steal the palace out from under them, Agnes struggles to save her family and finds bravery, love, and loyalty in the most unexpected places. The Moonlight Palace is a coming-of-age tale rich with historical detail and unforgettable characters set against the backdrop of dazzling 1920s Singapore.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-11-07T12:02:35.432Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:d163e78af9612e4f359c45094db4a8468ce98bd9","dn":"The Moonlight Palace by Liz Rosenberg EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"d163e78af9612e4f359c45094db4a8468ce98bd9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,99,231,138,249,97,46,79,53,156,69,9,77,180,168,70,140,233,139,217]},"name":"The Moonlight Palace by Liz Rosenberg EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
