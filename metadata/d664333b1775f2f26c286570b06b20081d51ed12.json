Do you resist asking for what you want for fear of getting a NO? Do you allow the opinions of others to define your self-worth?\r\n\r\nDo you want to take action without the fear of failing? Now, you can become rejection free and break your barriers of fear and self-doubt.\r\n\r\nI know rejection hurts. We take it personally when people fail to give us what we desire the most. But getting rejected is a state of mind. It has power over you if you let it in by believing the worst.\r\n\r\nRejection Free teaches you to free yourself from the feelings of shame and the fear of loss. By taking action in the face of fear, you release yourself from an emotional rollercoaster and learn to live your life with greater confidence.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-03-11T12:01:02.463Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:d664333b1775f2f26c286570b06b20081d51ed12","dn":"Rejection Free by Scott Allan AZW3","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"d664333b1775f2f26c286570b06b20081d51ed12","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,100,51,59,23,117,242,242,108,40,101,112,176,107,32,8,29,81,237,18]},"name":"Rejection Free by Scott Allan AZW3","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
