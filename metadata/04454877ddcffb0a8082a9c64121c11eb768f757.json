By the time she and her lifelong friend, Z&#xF3;ra, begin to inoculate the children there, she feels age-old superstitions and secrets gathering everywhere around her. Secrets her outwardly cheerful hosts have chosen not to tell her. Secrets involving the strange family digging for something in the surrounding vineyards. Secrets hidden in the landscape itself.\r\n\r\nBut Natalia is also confronting a private, hurtful mystery of her own: the inexplicable circumstances surrounding her beloved grandfather&#x2019;s recent death. After telling her grandmother that he was on his way to meet Natalia, he instead set off for a ramshackle settlement none of their family had ever heard of and died there alone. A famed physician, her grandfather must have known that he was too ill to travel. Why he left home becomes a riddle Natalia is compelled to unravel.\r\n\r\nGrief struck and searching for clues to her grandfather&#x2019;s final state of mind, she turns to the stories he told her when she was a child. &#x201C;These stories,&#x201D; Natalia comes to understand, &#x201C;run like secret rivers through all the other stories&#x201D; of her grandfather&#x2019;s life. And it is ultimately within these rich, luminous narratives that she will find the answer she is looking for.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-11-06T12:03:11.355Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:04454877ddcffb0a8082a9c64121c11eb768f757","dn":"The Tiger's Wife by Tea Obreht EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"04454877ddcffb0a8082a9c64121c11eb768f757","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,69,72,119,221,207,251,10,128,130,169,198,65,33,193,30,183,104,247,87]},"name":"The Tiger's Wife by Tea Obreht EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
