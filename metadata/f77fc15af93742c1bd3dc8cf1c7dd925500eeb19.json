Godless, fatherless, childless, and divorced, Aaliya is her family&apos;s &quot;unnecessary appendage.&quot; Every year, she translates a new favorite book into Arabic, then stows it away. The 37 books that Aaliya has translated over her lifetime have never been read by anyone.\r\n\r\nIn this breathtaking portrait of a reclusive woman&apos;s late-life crisis, readers follow Aaliya&apos;s digressive mind as it ricochets across visions of past and present Beirut. Colorful musings on literature, philosophy, and art are invaded by memories of the Lebanese Civil War and Aaliya&apos;s own volatile past. As she tries to overcome her aging body and spontaneous emotional upwellings, Aaliya is faced with an unthinkable disaster that threatens to shatter the little life she has left.\r\n\r\nA love letter to literature and its power to define who we are, the prodigiously gifted Rabih Alameddine has given us a nuanced rendering of one woman&apos;s life in the Middle East.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-09-24T12:53:10.931Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:f77fc15af93742c1bd3dc8cf1c7dd925500eeb19","dn":"An Unnecessary Woman by Rabih Alameddine EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"f77fc15af93742c1bd3dc8cf1c7dd925500eeb19","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,127,193,90,249,55,66,193,189,61,200,207,28,125,217,37,80,14,235,25]},"name":"An Unnecessary Woman by Rabih Alameddine EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
