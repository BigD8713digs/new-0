This season&apos;s theme, &quot;Heroes v. Healers v. Hustlers,&quot; sees the contestants separated into three tribes based on how they are perceived by others -- those heralded for their achievements, those who receive gratitude for their work and those who must earn the respect of others -- as they vie to outwit, outplay and outlast one another. This round of castaways includes a professional football player, a nurse practitioner and a diversity advocate. In the end, one castaway earns the title of Sole Survivor.\r\n\r\nFirst episode date: 31 May 2000\r\nStarring: Survivor contestants\r\nPresented by: Jeff Probst\r\nTheme song: Survivor Theme Song","last_updated":"2017-12-21T12:03:31.255Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:f8d9fb790a022e45fc27cec9e1d361a037c46a5d","dn":"Survivor.S35E14.720p.HDTV.x264.[1.2GB]","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"f8d9fb790a022e45fc27cec9e1d361a037c46a5d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,217,251,121,10,2,46,69,252,39,206,201,225,211,97,160,55,196,106,93]},"name":"Survivor.S35E14.720p.HDTV.x264.[1.2GB]","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
