Actually, the recording \r\nversion I used for this comes from the Southern Choice (Italian) boot, as \r\nthat versipn has a clearer brighter sound (probably earlier generation \r\nrecording) than some other boots (&apos;Lost in North Carolina&apos;, &apos;Free Fallin&apos;) \r\nidentified as 1989-09-13","last_updated":"2017-11-06T12:14:12.180Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:d2b847ca0f285fcea0bf2e7ac5d274a127fefa67","dn":"Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers 1989-09-13 Chapel Hill, NC FLAC","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"d2b847ca0f285fcea0bf2e7ac5d274a127fefa67","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,184,71,202,15,40,95,206,160,191,46,122,197,210,116,161,39,254,250,103]},"name":"Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers 1989-09-13 Chapel Hill, NC FLAC","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
