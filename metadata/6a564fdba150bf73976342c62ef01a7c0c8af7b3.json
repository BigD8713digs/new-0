But once she meets the mysterious and alluring Edward Cullen, Isabella&apos;s life takes a thrilling and terrifying turn. Up until now, Edward has managed to keep his vampire identity a secret in the small community he lives in, but now nobody is safe, especially Isabella, the person Edward holds most dear. The lovers find themselves balanced precariously on the point of a knife, between desire and danger.\r\n\r\nDeeply sensuous and extraordinarily suspenseful, Twilight captures the struggle between defying our instincts and satisfying our desires. This is a love story with bite.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-07-17T12:01:03.428Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a564fdba150bf73976342c62ef01a7c0c8af7b3","dn":"Twilight (The Twilight Saga series_book 1) by Stephenie Meyer ep","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"6a564fdba150bf73976342c62ef01a7c0c8af7b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,86,79,219,161,80,191,115,151,99,66,198,46,240,26,124,12,138,247,179]},"name":"Twilight (The Twilight Saga series_book 1) by Stephenie Meyer ep","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
