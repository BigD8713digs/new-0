With this course, you&#x2019;ll not only understand what those systems are and how they fit together &#x2013; but you&#x2019;ll go hands-on and learn how to use them to solve real business problems!Learn and master the most popular big data technologies in this comprehensive course, taught by a former engineer and senior manager from Amazon and IMDb. We&#x2019;ll go way beyond Hadoop itself, and dive into all sorts of distributed systems you may need to integrate with.\r\n\r\nWho is the target audience?\r\n    Software engineers and programmers who want to understand the larger Hadoop ecosystem, and use it to store, analyze, and vend &#x201C;big data&#x201D; at scale.\r\n    Project, program, or product managers who want to understand the lingo and high-level architecture of Hadoop.\r\n    Data analysts and database administrators who are curious about Hadoop and how it relates to their work.\r\n    System architects who need to understand the components available in the Hadoop ecosystem, and how they fit together.\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n    You will need access to a PC running 64-bit Windows, MacOS, or Linux with an Internet connection, if you want to participate in the hands-on activities and exercises. You must have at least 8GB of free RAM on your system; 10GB or more is recommended. If your PC does not meet these requirements, you can still follow along in the course without doing hands-on activities.\r\n    Some activities will require some prior programming experience, preferably in Python or Scala.\r\n    A basic familiarity with the Linux command line will be very helpful.\r\nLast updated 8/2018","last_updated":"2018-09-09T12:15:23.901Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:b3297497ca89d7ef37cbc78b34594a8323e33d0e","dn":"Udemy - The Ultimate Hands-On Hadoop - Tame your Big Data!","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"b3297497ca89d7ef37cbc78b34594a8323e33d0e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,41,116,151,202,137,215,239,55,203,199,139,52,89,74,131,35,227,61,14]},"name":"Udemy - The Ultimate Hands-On Hadoop - Tame your Big Data!","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
