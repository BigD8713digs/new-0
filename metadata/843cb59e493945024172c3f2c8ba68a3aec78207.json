His girlfriend, Laura, has just left him for the guy upstairs, and Rob is both miserable and relieved. After all, could he have spent his life with someone who has a bad record collection? Rob seeks refuge in the company of the clerks at his store who endlessly review their top five films (Reservoir Dogs...), top five Elvis Costello songs (Alison...), and top five episodes of Cheers (the one where Woody sang his stupid song to Kelly...). Rob tries dating a singer whose rendition of &quot;Baby, I Love Your Way&quot; makes him cry. But maybe its just that he&apos;s always wanted to sleep with someone who has a record contract. Then he sees Laura again. And Rob begins to think (awful as it sounds) that a life as an episode of thirtysomething, with all the kids and marriages and barbecues and k.d. lang CDs that this implies, might not be so bad.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-07-05T12:00:14.162Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:843cb59e493945024172c3f2c8ba68a3aec78207","dn":"High Fidelity by Nick Hornby epub RtR","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"843cb59e493945024172c3f2c8ba68a3aec78207","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,60,181,158,73,57,69,2,65,114,195,242,200,186,104,163,174,199,130,7]},"name":"High Fidelity by Nick Hornby epub RtR","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
