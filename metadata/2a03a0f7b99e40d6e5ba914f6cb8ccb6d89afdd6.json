Their mother&apos;s beach house is the only place any of them ever found true happiness and they need to begin the difficult process of letting go. Memories of their grandmother, mother, and their Irish father, who sailed away the year Dar turned twelve, rise up and expose the fine cracks in their family myth-especially when a cache of old letters reveals enough truth to send them back to their ancestral homeland.\r\nTransplanted into the unfamiliar, each sister sees life, her heart, and her relationship to home in a new way. But how do they let go of a place that contains the complicated love of their imperfect family? Without the house, where will they be together?\r\nThe novel is a season on Martha&apos;s Vineyard; a mission to Ireland; a cast of friends, including one wildly off-the-grid Zen genius; passionate love in the surf; and three very different sisters with lives filled with beauty, sorrow, and deep love they&apos;d never been quite sure they could trust. The Silver Boat is Luanne Rice at her very best, complete with her singular talent for capturing a family in all its flawed complexity","last_updated":"2018-05-12T12:08:13.139Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a03a0f7b99e40d6e5ba914f6cb8ccb6d89afdd6","dn":"Luanne Rice-The Secret Language of Sisters- 4 books[epub]","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"2a03a0f7b99e40d6e5ba914f6cb8ccb6d89afdd6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,3,160,247,185,158,64,214,229,186,145,79,108,184,204,182,216,154,253,214]},"name":"Luanne Rice-The Secret Language of Sisters- 4 books[epub]","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
