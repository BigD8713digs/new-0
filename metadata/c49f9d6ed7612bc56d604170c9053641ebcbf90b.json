Summoned to the home of the fabulously wealthy General Sternwood, Marlowe is hired to deal with a blackmailer shaking down the General&apos;s sensuous, thumb-sucking daughter Carmen. This earns Marlowe the displeasure of Carmen&apos;s sloe-eyed, seemingly straight-laced older sister Vivian (Bacall). As he pursues the case at hand, Marlowe gets mixed up in the murder of Arthur Geiger, a dealer in pornography.  Any further attempts to outline the plot would be futile: the storyline becomes so complicated and convoluted that even screenwriters were forced to consult Raymond Chandler for advice (he was as confused by the plot as the screenwriters). When originally prepared for release in 1945, The Big Sleep featured a long exposition scene featuring police detective Bernie Ohls explaining the more obscure plot details. This expository scene was ultimately sacrificed, along with several others, in favor of building up Bacall&apos;s part, obliging Warners to replace a supporting player who&apos;d gone on to another project. The end result was one of the most famously baffling film noirs but also one of the most successful in sheer star power.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTARS.........: Humphrey Bogart, Lauren Bacall, John Ridgely\r\nDIRECTOR......: Howard Hawks\r\nWRITERS.......: William Faulkner, Leigh Brackett, Jules Furthman\r\nGENRE.........: Crime, Film-Noir, Mystery \r\nTOMATOMETER...: 96\r\nIMDB RATING...: 8.0/10  70,712 votes\r\nIMDB LINK.....: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0038355\r\nRUNTIME.......: 1h 53mn\r\nSIZE..........: 4.95 GB\r\nVIDEO CODEC...: HEVC (Main@L4)\r\nBITRATE.......: 6000 Kbps (2-pass)\r\nRESOLUTION....: 1920x1080\r\nASPECT RATIO..: 1.37:1\r\nFRAMERATE.....: 23.976 fps\r\nAUDIO.........: English AAC Mono 206kbps CVBR\r\nSUBTITLES.....: ENG\r\nCHAPTERS......: Yes\r\nSOURCE........: Blu Ray\r\nENCODED BY....: Sartre\r\nENCODE DATE...: 2018-05-26\r\n\r\n\r\nExtras\r\n\r\n-Introduction by Robert Gitt\r\n-1945 Alternate Version\r\n-1945/1946 Comparisons\r\n-Theatrical Trailer","last_updated":"2018-06-07T12:12:59.362Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:c49f9d6ed7612bc56d604170c9053641ebcbf90b","dn":"The.Big.Sleep.1946.1080p.BluRay.HEVC.AAC-SARTRE","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"c49f9d6ed7612bc56d604170c9053641ebcbf90b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,159,157,110,215,97,43,197,109,96,65,112,201,5,54,65,235,203,249,11]},"name":"The.Big.Sleep.1946.1080p.BluRay.HEVC.AAC-SARTRE","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
