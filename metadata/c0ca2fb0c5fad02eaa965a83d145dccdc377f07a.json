The tool was specifically built to add an extra layer of security to your system, in order to protect you whenever you shop on the Internet or perform online banking operations. It offers real-time PC protection against software exploits, drive-by downloads, crypto-ransomware, online fraud, and identity theft.\r\n\r\nIntuitive interface and malware scans\r\nThe tool sports an attractive and clear-cut interface, and offers to perform a malware scan right after installation, in order to get the security assessment of your computer.\r\nScan results show the name, full path of infected file and type of each threat. You can either delete files or ignore threats, as well as apply an action to the current file or all of them. These log details can be saved to file for later examination.\r\n\r\nSafe browsing and exploit mitigation\r\nWhen it comes to safe browsing, HitmanPro.Alert protects your activities surrounding online banking, shopping or web mail. It offers support for many browsers, such as Internet Explorer, Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Maxthon, Comodo Dragon, Pale Moon, Tor Browser Bundle, Avant Browser, Spark Browser, SRWare Iron and Yandex Browser.\r\nThe feature dedicated to exploit mitigation prevents several third-party applications from current and future vulnerability attacks, like Java, VLC Media Player, Windows Media Player, Windows Media Center, Wordpad and Adobe Flash Player. Currently running processes that aren&#x2019;t supported by HitmanPro.Alert are shown in another panel, so you can at least be aware of risks.\r\n\r\nVaccination, CryptoGuard and webcam notifier\r\nThe software application sports additional tools to reduce the risk of malware infections. For instance, it can stop sandbox-aware malware by making the computer look like it belongs to a virus researcher, block crypto-ransomware (like CryptoLocker) by keeping local and shared files safe, or warn you when your webcam was silently turned on to watch you","last_updated":"2018-07-12T12:04:19.813Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0ca2fb0c5fad02eaa965a83d145dccdc377f07a","dn":"HitmanPro.Alert 3.7.8 Build 750 Multilingual Full With Medicine[","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"c0ca2fb0c5fad02eaa965a83d145dccdc377f07a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,202,47,176,197,250,208,46,170,150,90,131,209,69,220,205,195,119,240,122]},"name":"HitmanPro.Alert 3.7.8 Build 750 Multilingual Full With Medicine[","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
