Michener uses individuals&apos; experiences to symbolize the struggle of the various races to establish themselves in the islands\r\n\r\nThe novel was published in 1959, the same year Hawaii became the 50th U.S. state.\r\n\r\nThe historical correctness of the novel is high, although the narrative about the early Polynesian inhabitants is based more on folklore than anthropological and archaeological sources. Written in episodic format like many of Michener&apos;s works, the book narrates the story of the original Hawaiians who sailed to the islands from Bora Bora, the early American missionaries (in this case, Calvinist missionaries) and merchants, and the Chinese and Japanese immigrants who traveled to work and seek their fortunes in Hawaii. The story begins with the formation of the islands themselves millions of years ago and ends in the mid-1950s. Each section explores the experiences of different groups of arrivals","last_updated":"2017-12-04T12:07:42.302Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:54dd2f6c6ba6b638402d1cd42a81917f929906e8","dn":"HAWAII by James A.
