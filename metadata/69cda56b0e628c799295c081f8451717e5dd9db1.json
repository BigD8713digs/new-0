Schaub EPUB\r\n\r\nWhere is your sugar coming from? Most likely everywhere. Sure, it&apos;s in ice cream and cookies, but what scared Eve O. Schaub was the secret world of sugar - hidden in bacon, crackers, salad dressing, pasta sauce, chicken broth, and baby food. With her eyes open by the work of obesity expert Dr. Robert Lustig and others, Eve challenged her husband and two school-age daughters to join her on a quest to eat no added sugar for an entire year. Along the way, Eve uncovered the real costs of our sugar-heavy American diet including diabetes, obesity, and increased incidences of health problems such as heart disease and cancer. The stories, tips, and recipes she shares throw fresh light on questionable nutritional advice we&apos;ve been following for years and show that it is possible to eat at restaurants and go grocery shopping - with less and even no added sugar.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-01-22T21:40:18.634Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:69cda56b0e628c799295c081f8451717e5dd9db1","dn":"Year of No Sugar by Eve O.
