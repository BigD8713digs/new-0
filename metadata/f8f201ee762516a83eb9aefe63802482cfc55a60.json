And he never will be. But if he isn&apos;t a real Avery, then who is he? Born out of wedlock to a teenage girl cast out from her rural Irish community and adopted by a well-to-do if eccentric Dublin couple via the intervention of a hunchbacked Redemptorist nun, Cyril is adrift in the world, anchored only tenuously by his heartfelt friendship with the infinitely more glamourous and dangerous Julian Woodbead. At the mercy of fortune and coincidence, he will spend a lifetime coming to know himself and where he came from - and, over his three score years and ten, will struggle to discover an identity, a home, a country and much more.\r\n\r\nIn this, Boyne&apos;s most transcendent work to date, we are shown the story of Ireland from the 1940s to today through the eyes of one ordinary man. The Heart&apos;s Invisible Furies is a novel to make you laugh and cry while reminding us all of the redemptive power of the human spirit.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-08-03T12:00:31.817Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:f8f201ee762516a83eb9aefe63802482cfc55a60","dn":"The Heart's Invisible Furies by John Boyne ePUB MOBI eBOOK-ZAK","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"f8f201ee762516a83eb9aefe63802482cfc55a60","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,242,1,238,118,37,22,168,62,185,174,254,99,128,36,130,207,197,90,96]},"name":"The Heart's Invisible Furies by John Boyne ePUB MOBI eBOOK-ZAK","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
