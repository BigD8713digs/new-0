The Zone, as the area got to be known, was characterized \r\n  by anomalous energy disturbances, rendering even the most advanced form \r\n  of protective suits worthless to would be rescue teams. Months passed \r\n  and nothing could be done. The military quarantined the area to prevent \r\n  unauthorized entry and perhaps even reassure the local populace that the \r\n  area was under control and confinement. Almost 4 years after the initial \r\n  event, expeditions can now safely traverse several kilometers deep into \r\n  the Zone. Among these are the Stalkers, poachers that enter the zone \r\n  searching for artifacts and anomalous formations that are highly sought \r\n  after by certain organizations and groups. \r\n  \r\n  The player controls a Stalker, venturing into the Zone in order to \r\n  acquire information, technology and artifacts to sell and possibly put a \r\n  mysterious puzzle together. Avoiding the dangers within and the military \r\n  because as a Stalker you are effectively a thief, and the army that has \r\n  quarantined the area, don&apos;t take kindly to trespassers. Within the Zone \r\n  you will have to detect and avoid the bizarre phenomenon&apos;s (anomalies) \r\n  that plague the area, avoid or eliminate various kinds of mutants and \r\n  you can even expect competition from other Stalkers","last_updated":"2017-09-04T12:00:44.175Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d0aa5914fd34f8ea3bb0b46785f1107088f3737","dn":"S.T.A.L.K.E.R.Shadow.of.Chernobyl-ViTALiTY","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"4d0aa5914fd34f8ea3bb0b46785f1107088f3737","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,10,165,145,79,211,79,142,163,187,11,70,120,95,17,7,8,143,55,55]},"name":"S.T.A.L.K.E.R.Shadow.of.Chernobyl-ViTALiTY","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
