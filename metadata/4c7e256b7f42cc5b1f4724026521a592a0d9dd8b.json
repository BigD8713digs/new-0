With her own inexorable but utterly unpredictable logic and her almost uncanny ability to conjure the strange states of mind and emotion that constitute our daily consciousness, Eisenberg pulls us as if by gossamer threads through her characters&#x2014;a tormented woman whose face determines her destiny; a group of film actors shocked to read a book about their past; a privileged young man who unexpectedly falls into a love affair with a human rights worker caught up in an all-consuming quest that he doesn&apos;t understand.In Eisenberg&#x2019;s world, the forces of money, sex, and power cannot be escaped, and the force of history, whether confronted or denied, cannot be evaded. No one writes better about time, tragedy and grief, and the indifferent but beautiful universe around us","last_updated":"2018-09-30T12:03:12.018Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c7e256b7f42cc5b1f4724026521a592a0d9dd8b","dn":"Deborah Eisenberg - Your Duck Is My Duck  (epub)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"4c7e256b7f42cc5b1f4724026521a592a0d9dd8b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,126,37,107,127,66,204,91,31,71,36,2,101,33,165,146,160,217,221,139]},"name":"Deborah Eisenberg - Your Duck Is My Duck  (epub)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
