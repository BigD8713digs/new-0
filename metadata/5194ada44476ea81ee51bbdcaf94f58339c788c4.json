Growing up in Hawaii and of Chinese descent, he always imagined he&#x2019;d be a doctor like his father. He enrolled at Notre Dame as a premed student and didn&#x2019;t think much of playing football until he decided he needed a more well-rounded life. He was the placekicker on his high school football team and decided to walk on to Notre Dame&#x2019;s. At 5-foot-5 and 135 pounds, Ho was one of the smallest players in a major college football program &#x2014; and suddenly became a celebrity on and off campus. As a walk-on, Ho didn&#x2019;t receive any financial support from his school: a pure student-athlete. He did it for the love of the game and for the love of Notre Dame. After the 1988 season, the walk-on walked off the field. Ho continued his premed degree, but no longer played football. Yet he was a crucial part in Notre Dame&#x2019;s most recent undefeated season.\n \n COVER <a href=\" https://imgmak.com/image/I2T\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\"> https://imgmak.com/image/I2T</a>\n \n MEDIAINFO\n Container = Matroska (mkv)\n Duration = 01:29:12.384\n Filesize = 2 GiB\n --Video\n Codec info = AVC High@L3.1 | V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\n Resolution = 1280x720\n Display AR = 1.778 | 16:9\n Bitrate = 3 034 kb/s\n Framerate = CFR 23.976\n Color space = YUV\n Chroma subsampling = 4:2:0\n Encoder = \n --Audio\n Codec info = E-AC-3 | A_EAC3\n Channels = 6\n Bitrate = CBR 640 kb/s\n Samplerate = 48.0 kHz\n Language = English\n \n SCREENS\n  <a href=\" https://imgmak.com/image/I2a\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\"> https://imgmak.com/image/I2a</a>\n \n  <a href=\" https://imgmak.com/image/I2p\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\"> https://imgmak.com/image/I2p</a>\n \n  <a href=\" https://imgmak.com/image/I2R\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\"> https://imgmak.com/image/I2R</a>\n \n  <a href=\" https://imgmak.com/image/I2b\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\"> https://imgmak.com/image/I2b</a>\n \n  <a href=\" https://imgmak.com/image/I2x\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\"> https://imgmak.com/image/I2x</a>\n \n  <a href=\" https://imgmak.com/image/I2z\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\"> https://imgmak.com/image/I2z</a>","last_updated":"2018-10-03T12:06:43.561Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:5194ada44476ea81ee51bbdcaf94f58339c788c4","dn":"Student.Athlete.2018.720p.AMZN.WEB-DL.DDP5.1.H.264-NTG[TGx]","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"5194ada44476ea81ee51bbdcaf94f58339c788c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,148,173,164,68,118,234,129,238,81,187,220,175,148,245,131,57,199,136,196]},"name":"Student.Athlete.2018.720p.AMZN.WEB-DL.DDP5.1.H.264-NTG[TGx]","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
