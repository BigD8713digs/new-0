Philosophers have told him he&#x2019;s a philosopher. Religious groups have invited him to speak. He had a cult following as a cartoonist. But, above all else, Tim Kreider is an essayist&#x2014;one whose deft prose, uncanny observations, dark humor, and emotional vulnerability have earned him deserved comparisons to David Sedaris, Sarah Vowell, and the late David Foster Wallace (who was himself a fan of Kreider&#x2019;s humor).\n\nIn his new collection, I Wrote This Book Because I Love You, he focuses his unique perception and wit on his relationships with women&#x2014;romantic, platonic, and the murky in-between. He talks about his difficulty finding lasting love, and seeks to understand his commitment issues by tracking down the John Hopkins psychologist who tested him for a groundbreaking study on attachment when he was a toddler. He talks about his valued female friendships, one of which landed him on a circus train bound for Mexico. He talks about his time teaching young women at an upstate New York college, and the profound lessons they wound up teaching him. And in a hugely popular essay that originally appeared in The New York Times, he talks about his nineteen-year-old cat, wondering if it&#x2019;s the most enduring relationship he&#x2019;ll ever have.\n\nEach of these pieces is hilarious and profound, and collectively they further cement Kreider&#x2019;s place among the best essayists working today.\n\n\n    <a href=\"\nhttps://pirates-forum.org/Forum-Requests\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://pirates-forum.org/Forum-Requests</a>\n","last_updated":"2018-06-10T12:00:55.446Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:5de76da8f8d1a3f5ab7091a759b5d58d29363e66","dn":"Tim Kreider - I Wrote This Book Because I Love You: Essays","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"5de76da8f8d1a3f5ab7091a759b5d58d29363e66","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,231,109,168,248,209,163,245,171,112,145,167,89,181,213,141,41,54,62,102]},"name":"Tim Kreider - I Wrote This Book Because I Love You: Essays","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
