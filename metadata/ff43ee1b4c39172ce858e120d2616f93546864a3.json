Drawing on a wide range of examples, from the expanding drone assassination program to the threat of nuclear warfare as well as the flashpoints of Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, and Israel/Palestine, he offers unexpected and nuanced insights into the workings of imperial power on our increasingly chaotic planet.\r\n\r\nIn the process Chomsky provides a brilliant anatomy of just how US elites have grown ever more insulated from any democratic constraints on their power. While the broader population is lulled into apathy - diverted to consumerism or hatred of the vulnerable - the corporations and the rich have increasingly been allowed to do as they please.\r\n\r\nFierce, unsparing, and meticulously documented, Who Rules the World? delivers the indispensable understanding of the central conflicts and dangers of our time that we have come to expect from Chomsky.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-11-12T12:00:43.838Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff43ee1b4c39172ce858e120d2616f93546864a3","dn":"Who Rules the World by Noam Chomsky EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"ff43ee1b4c39172ce858e120d2616f93546864a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,67,238,27,76,57,23,44,232,88,225,32,210,97,111,147,84,104,100,163]},"name":"Who Rules the World by Noam Chomsky EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
