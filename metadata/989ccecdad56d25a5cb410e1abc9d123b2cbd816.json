But there is one leap of faith Taylor can&apos;t bring himself to make: He can&apos;t fall in love.\r\n\r\nThen, one day, a raging, record-breaking storm hits his small Southern town. Denise Holton, a young single mother, is driving through it when her car skids off the road. With her is her four-year-old son, Kyle. Unconscious and bleeding, she - not Kyle - is found. And when she wakes, the chilling truth becomes clear to both of them: Kyle is gone.\r\n\r\nDuring the search for Kyle, the connection, the lifeline, between Taylor and Denise takes root. Taylor doesn&apos;t know that this rescue will lead him to the possibility of his own rescue from a life lived without love. That it will dare him to live life to the fullest by daring to love.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-03-28T12:00:48.927Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:989ccecdad56d25a5cb410e1abc9d123b2cbd816","dn":"The Rescue by Nicholas Sparks EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"989ccecdad56d25a5cb410e1abc9d123b2cbd816","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,156,206,205,173,86,210,90,92,180,16,225,171,201,209,35,178,203,216,22]},"name":"The Rescue by Nicholas Sparks EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
