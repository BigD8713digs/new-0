Did they share the modern Western conception&#x2014;popularized in modern fantasy literature and role-playing games&#x2014;of &quot;barbarians&quot; as brutish, unwashed enemies of civilization? Or our related notion of &quot;the noble savage?&quot; Was the category fixed or fluid? How did it contrast with the Greeks and Romans&apos; conception of their own cultural identity? Was it based on race? \r\n\r\nIn accessible, jargon-free prose, Erik Jensen addresses these and other questions through a copiously illustrated introduction to the varied and evolving ways in which the ancient Greeks and Romans engaged with, and thought about, foreign peoples&#x2014;and to the recent historical and archaeological scholarship that has overturned received understandings of the relationship of Classical civilization to its &quot;others.&quot;\r\n\r\nGenre: Non-Fiction &gt; History","last_updated":"2018-10-11T12:14:55.666Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:2efbaa60e5cfc035bb6b8c66504c97ba7c8a540f","dn":"Barbarians in the Greek and Roman World by Erik Jensen (.epub)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"2efbaa60e5cfc035bb6b8c66504c97ba7c8a540f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,251,170,96,229,207,192,53,187,107,140,102,80,76,151,186,124,138,84,15]},"name":"Barbarians in the Greek and Roman World by Erik Jensen (.epub)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
