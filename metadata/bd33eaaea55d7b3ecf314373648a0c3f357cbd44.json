Burzynski has gleaned what little information is available in documents from the time and filled in the blanks with his own extensive research and historical background. What has emerged from those efforts is one of the most thorough and interesting accounts of a pivotal period in American military history. The author&#x2019;s stirring prose is amplified by beautiful artwork created by noted Marine Corps historian and fine artist Charles Waterhouse. \r\n\r\n\r\nGenre: Non-Fiction &gt; History","last_updated":"2018-09-23T12:24:41.752Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd33eaaea55d7b3ecf314373648a0c3f357cbd44","dn":"The First Leathernecks by Don Burzynski (.epub)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"bd33eaaea55d7b3ecf314373648a0c3f357cbd44","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,51,234,174,165,93,123,62,207,49,67,115,100,138,12,63,53,124,189,68]},"name":"The First Leathernecks by Don Burzynski (.epub)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
