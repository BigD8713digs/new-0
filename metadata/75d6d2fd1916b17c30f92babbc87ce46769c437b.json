In fascinating, thought-provoking passages, he explores questions such as, Why is there conflict between groups? Why do people believe low-value information such as rumors? Why are there religions? What is social justice? What explains morality? Boyer provides a new picture of cultural transmission that draws on the pragmatics of human communication, the constructive nature of memory in human brains, and human motivation for group formation and cooperation","last_updated":"2018-09-08T12:26:06.944Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:75d6d2fd1916b17c30f92babbc87ce46769c437b","dn":"Minds Make Societies by Pascal Boyer (.epub)(.pdf)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"75d6d2fd1916b17c30f92babbc87ce46769c437b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,214,210,253,25,22,177,124,48,249,43,171,188,135,206,70,118,156,67,123]},"name":"Minds Make Societies by Pascal Boyer (.epub)(.pdf)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
