Alexander, Rotondi, and Farnsworth had all been acquainted in New York City as far back as 1988, and later Farnsworth introduced Davis to the other musicians. Hazeltine and Peter Washington began performing with the former four players in 1996 at the jazz club Augie&apos;s, which would later be re-opened as Smoke,[3] a venue at which the group would record a live album. Washington was replaced by John Webber, and the band has since signed to the Criss Cross label. The name One for All is borrowed from the Jazz Messengers&apos;s last album. - Wiki","last_updated":"2017-08-27T12:07:47.865Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:d79895dc77af1584f56dec3c68d8cb34df9884b2","dn":"One For All 1999 Upward And Onward","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"d79895dc77af1584f56dec3c68d8cb34df9884b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,152,149,220,119,175,21,132,245,109,236,60,104,216,203,52,223,152,132,178]},"name":"One For All 1999 Upward And Onward","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
