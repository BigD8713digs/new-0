Is it just a religious text? When was it composed? How relevant is it to the modern world?\r\n\r\nThis book answers these foundational questions and goes beyond. It critically examines the Bhagavad-Gita in terms of its liberal, humanist and inclusive appeal, bringing out its significance for the present times and novel applications. The author elaborates the philosophy underlying the text as also its ethical, spiritual and moral implications. He also responds to criticisms that have been levelled against the text by Ambedkar, D. D. Kosambi, and more recently, Amartya Sen. The volume proposes unique bearings of the text in diverse fields such as business &amp; management and scientific research.\r\n\r\nEclectic and accessible, this work will be of interest to scholars of philosophy, religion, history, business &amp; management studies as well as the general reader.\r\n\r\nTaylor and Francis, October 2017\r\nImprint: Routledge India\r\nISBN: 9781315438986\r\nLanguage: English\r\n <a href=\"\nhttps://www.kobo.com/us/en/ebook/the-bhagavad-gita-for-the-modern-reader\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://www.kobo.com/us/en/ebook/the-bhagavad-gita-for-the-modern-reader</a>","last_updated":"2018-05-22T12:11:09.848Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c4ca0f676d84e60832dfd321c65febe763774ce","dn":"The Bhagavad-Gita for the Modern Reader: History, interpretation","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"7c4ca0f676d84e60832dfd321c65febe763774ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,76,160,246,118,216,78,96,131,45,253,50,28,101,254,190,118,55,116,206]},"name":"The Bhagavad-Gita for the Modern Reader: History, interpretation","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
