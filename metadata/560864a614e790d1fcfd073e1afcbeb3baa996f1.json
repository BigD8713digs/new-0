Many ancient historians were veryand Edward Gibbon later dubbed him &#x2018;the common enemy of mankind&#x2019;. Yet his reign was considered by at least one Roman author to be the apogee of the Roman Empire. Guilty of many murders and massacres (including his own brother, ex-wife and daughter) he was, however, popular with the army, improving their pay and cultivating the image of sharing their hardships. Surprisingly this is the first full-length biography of this colorful character in English. \r\n\r\nIlkka Syvanne explains how the biased ancient sources in combination with the stern looking statues of the emperor have created a distorted image of the man and then reconstructs the actual events, particularly his military campaigns and reforms, to offer a balanced view of his reign. The biography offers the first complete overview of the policies, events and military campaigns of the reign and explains how and why these contributed to the military crisis of the third century.\r\n\r\nHardcover: 368 pages\r\nPublisher: Pen and Sword (September 25, 2017)","last_updated":"2017-12-30T12:00:43.663Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:560864a614e790d1fcfd073e1afcbeb3baa996f1","dn":"Caracalla: A Military Biography","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"560864a614e790d1fcfd073e1afcbeb3baa996f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,8,100,166,20,231,144,209,252,253,7,62,26,252,190,179,186,169,150,241]},"name":"Caracalla: A Military Biography","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
