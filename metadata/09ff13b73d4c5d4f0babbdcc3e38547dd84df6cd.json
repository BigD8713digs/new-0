So, why do we perceive a flow of time? Is the future &#x201C;already there&#x201D;, and is the past &#x201C;still there&#x201D;, even though we are only aware of a single moment of time? \r\n\r\nDrawing on the latest ideas from both relativity and quantum theory, award-winning science writer John Gribbin (In Search of Schr&#xF6;dinger&#x2019;s Cat) addresses the questions that have baffled philosophers since antiquity and Zeno&#x2019;s arrow paradox. Along the way, we find that in the quantum world it is literally true that a watched pot never boils, and learn how physicists have come to terms with the idea of the four-dimensional block universe as an explanation of the distinction between past, present and future. \r\n\r\nWhy do eggs break when we drop them, but never unbreak? The Universe as we know it began in a Big Bang, which in some sense marks the beginning of time. Is it possible that we need to invoke the Big Bang to explain why we never see unbroken eggs? This idea glories in the name &#x201C;the past hypothesis&#x201D;, but many physicists regard it as no more than an attempt to sweep the problem of the arrow of time under the rug. Read The Time Illusion and see if you agree! \r\n\r\nGenre: Non-Fiction &gt; Educational &gt; Science &gt; Physics","last_updated":"2018-12-07T12:22:13.003Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:09ff13b73d4c5d4f0babbdcc3e38547dd84df6cd","dn":"The Time Illusion (Kindle Single) by John Gribbin (.ePUB)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"09ff13b73d4c5d4f0babbdcc3e38547dd84df6cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,255,19,183,61,76,93,79,11,171,189,204,62,56,84,125,216,77,246,205]},"name":"The Time Illusion (Kindle Single) by John Gribbin (.ePUB)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
