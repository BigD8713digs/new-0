His most recent recordings appeared on Clean Feed in September of 2016, and they are definitely a treat for those who appreciate exciting, inventive trio work. The first release I&#x2019;ll talk about, Born in an Urban Ruin, features Wendell Harrison on Bb clarinet and Bb bass clarinet, Kevin Norton on vibraharp and other percussion, and the inimitable Lindberg on bass...\r\nLacking a traditional percussionist, it might seem that Lindberg&#x2019;s compositions would fall flat or run out of steam - that&#x2019;s not the case, however. The arrangements and bouts of improvisation are intriguing enough to maintain interest, and the ability of this trio to build up a specific atmosphere is top-notch. - Derek Stone, freejazzblog.org","last_updated":"2017-07-29T12:03:03.512Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:ccc2271527803ead54187d12022e37cd9282c222","dn":"John Lindberg BC3 2016 Born In An Urban Ruin","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"ccc2271527803ead54187d12022e37cd9282c222","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,194,39,21,39,128,62,173,84,24,125,18,2,46,55,205,146,130,194,34]},"name":"John Lindberg BC3 2016 Born In An Urban Ruin","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
