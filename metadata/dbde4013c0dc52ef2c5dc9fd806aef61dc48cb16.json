Later, Sweden fought in Muscovy with Irish, English, Scottish, French, and German troops. Units of Croats, Germans, Walloons, Albanians, and especially Swiss, served in French armies. In the Netherlands, Italians and Spaniards fought beside Irishmen, Germans, Dalmatians, and Walloons. Regiments of Swiss pikemen fought for Spain, France, and Venice, as well as for German and Italian princes. Companies of Poles, Hungarians, and Croatians fought in German regiments.\r\n\r\nGrowing national economies, unable to pay or feed massed armies for any length of time, thus became war states, an early nationalism which would later consume modern Europe. Furies: War in Europe, 1450-1700, by acclaimed historian of the Renaissance Lauro Martines, compellingly and simply delivers the story of modern Europe&apos;s martial roots, capturing the brutality of early modern war and how it shaped the history of a continent.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-06-16T12:03:59.223Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:dbde4013c0dc52ef2c5dc9fd806aef61dc48cb16","dn":"Furies: War in Europe, 1450-1700 by Lauro Martines EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"dbde4013c0dc52ef2c5dc9fd806aef61dc48cb16","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,222,64,19,192,220,82,239,44,93,201,253,128,106,239,97,220,72,203,22]},"name":"Furies: War in Europe, 1450-1700 by Lauro Martines EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
