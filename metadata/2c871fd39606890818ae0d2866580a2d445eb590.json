Yet the Romans were conquerors, imperialists who took by force a vast empire stretching from the Euphrates to the Atlantic coast. Ruthless, Romans won peace not through coexistence but through dominance; millions died and were enslaved during the creation of their empire.\r\n\r\nPax Romana examines how the Romans came to control so much of the world and asks whether traditionally favorable images of the Roman peace are true. Goldsworthy vividly recounts the rebellions of the conquered and examines why they broke out, why most failed, and how they became exceedingly rare. He reveals that hostility was just one reaction to the arrival of Rome and that from the outset, conquered peoples collaborated, formed alliances, and joined invaders, causing resistance movements to fade away.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-10-25T12:02:52.874Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c871fd39606890818ae0d2866580a2d445eb590","dn":"Pax Romana by Adrian Goldsworthy EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"2c871fd39606890818ae0d2866580a2d445eb590","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,135,31,211,150,6,137,8,24,174,13,40,102,88,10,45,68,94,181,144]},"name":"Pax Romana by Adrian Goldsworthy EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
