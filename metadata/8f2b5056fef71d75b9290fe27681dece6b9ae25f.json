DiRT 4 is all about embracing that danger. It&#x2019;s about the thrill, exhilaration and adrenaline that is absolutely vital to off-road racing. And more than that, it&#x2019;s about loving that feeling. It&#x2019;s about pushing flat out next to a sheer cliff drop. Going for the gap that&#x2019;s slightly too small. Seeing how much air you can get in a truck. They call it &#x2018;being fearless&#x2019;. \r\nDiRT 4 also features a game-changing system called Your Stage; an innovative rally route creation tool that allows you to produce an almost-infinite number of unique stages at the press of a button. You choose your location and set the route parameters, then Your Stage does the hard work to create a unique rally stage that you can race, share with your friends and then challenge them to beat your time. Your Stage allows experienced rally players to create longer, more technical routes, whilst newcomers can create simpler shorter routes as they hone their skills.\r\n=========\r\nSystem Requiremtens\r\n=========\r\nMINIMUM:\r\nOS: 64bit Versions of Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 10\r\nProcessor: AMD FX Series or Intel Core i3 Series\r\nMemory: 4 GB RAM\r\nGraphics: AMD HD5570 or NVIDIA GT440 with 1GB of VRAM (DirectX 11 graphics card required)\r\nNetwork: Broadband Internet connection\r\nStorage: 50 GB available space\r\nSound Card: DirectX Compatible soundcard\r\nAdditional Notes: Supported Graphics Cards: NVIDIA GT 440 or Above, GT 530 or Above, GT 630 or Above, GT 720 or Above, GTX 900 Series, GTX 1000 Series AMD HD 5570 or Above, HD 6570 or Above, HD 7570 or Above, R7 Series, R9 Series, RX Series\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDED:\r\nOS: 64bit Versions of Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 10\r\nProcessor: Intel Core i5 4690 or AMD FX 8320\r\nMemory: 8 GB RAM\r\nGraphics: NVIDIA GTX 780 or AMD R9 390\r\nNetwork: Broadband Internet connection\r\nStorage: 50 GB available space\r\nSound Card: DirectX Compatible soundcard\r\nAdditional Notes: Supported Graphics Cards: NVIDIA GT 440 or Above, GT 530 or Above, GT 630 or Above, GT 720 or Above, GTX 900 Series, GTX 1000 Series AMD HD 5570 or Above, HD 6570 or Above, HD 7570 or Above, R7 Series, R9 Series, RX Series\r\n===============\r\nHow to install\r\n===============\r\nAfter download is done:\r\n- open Dirt.4.v1.04-ENG.repack(executable file),\r\n- choose location ,\r\n- click install ,\r\n- wait until is done ,\r\n- play game from desktop shortcut","last_updated":"2017-07-08T12:00:41.623Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f2b5056fef71d75b9290fe27681dece6b9ae25f","dn":"Dirt.4.v1.04-ENG.repack","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"8f2b5056fef71d75b9290fe27681dece6b9ae25f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,43,80,86,254,247,29,117,185,41,15,226,118,129,222,206,107,154,226,95]},"name":"Dirt.4.v1.04-ENG.repack","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
