Focusing on the power of combining movement with intuition, Tara walks readers through the importance of moving with ease and creating space in their lives. Strala isn&apos;t about strict poses; it&apos;s about your body and your abilities. By moving how it feels good to move, readers will not only get a great workout but also release stress, free up space in their minds, and open themselves up to creativity.\r\nTara lays out simple, step-by-step information on everything from how to use the breath in movement, to how to create ease, to how to set up a home practice. More than ten routines-each illustrated with clear, instructional photos-offer both easy and more difficult tracks.\r\n\r\nAbout the Author\r\nTara Stiles is the founder and owner of Strala, the movement-based system that ignites freedom. She is a leading figure in the yoga movement and admired internationally for her work. Tara is the designer and face of Reebok&apos;s first yoga lifestyle range and is the author of four top selling books\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\nIntroduction\r\nPART ONE - MOVE WITH EASE\r\nChapter 1 discover ease: the strala philosophy\r\nChapter 2 create space: the breath-body connection\r\nChapter 3 follow your intuition: a reminder to feel\r\nChapter 4 get in the flow: finding natural movement\r\nChapter 5 set up: cultivating a regular practice\r\nPART TWO - RADIATE THROUGH MOVEMENT\r\nChapter 6 energize\r\nChapter 7 relax\r\nChapter 8 basics\r\nChapter 9 core\r\nChapter 10 gentle\r\nChapter 11 target practices\r\nPART THREE - DAILY PROGRAMS\r\nChapter 12 your 7-day jump start to ease\r\nChapter 13 your 30-day guide to ease\r\nconclusion\r\nacknowledgments\r\nabout the author\r\n <a href=\"\nhttps://s26.postimg.org/g01ucre2x/Strala_Yoga.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://s26.postimg.org/g01ucre2x/Strala_Yoga.jpg</a>","last_updated":"2017-09-05T12:06:13.874Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ca3fe989db516e73dffd8ace3d050180c440938","dn":"Strala Yoga - Be Strong, Focused N Ridiculously Happy (gnv64)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"5ca3fe989db516e73dffd8ace3d050180c440938","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,163,254,152,157,181,22,231,61,255,216,172,227,208,80,24,12,68,9,56]},"name":"Strala Yoga - Be Strong, Focused N Ridiculously Happy (gnv64)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
