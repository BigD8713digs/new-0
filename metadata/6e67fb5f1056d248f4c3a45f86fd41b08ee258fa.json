Just hours before, they&apos;d watched the Wildcats score a winning touchdown. Now, they&apos;re faced with the deaths of three cheerleaders - their promising lives cut short in a fatal crash. And the boy in the other car - the only one to survive - is believed to be at fault. As rumors begin to fly and accusations spin, allegiances form and long-kept secrets emerge.\r\n\r\nAt the center of the whirlwind are four women, each grappling with loss, regret, shame, and lies: Marglyn, a grieving mother; Darcy, whose son had been behind the wheel; Ava, a substitute teacher with a scandalous secret; and Leah, a cheerleader who should have been in the car with her friends, but wasn&apos;t. If the truth comes out, will it bring redemption - or will it be their downfall?\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-10-17T12:01:31.785Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e67fb5f1056d248f4c3a45f86fd41b08ee258fa","dn":"When We Were Worthy by Marybeth Mayhew Whalen EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"6e67fb5f1056d248f4c3a45f86fd41b08ee258fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,103,251,95,16,86,210,72,244,195,164,95,134,253,65,176,142,226,88,250]},"name":"When We Were Worthy by Marybeth Mayhew Whalen EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
