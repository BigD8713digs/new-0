After identifying the definitive aspects of satire, it goes on to examine the subjects which can be susceptible to satire, the modes and means of satire, the tone of satire and the satirist&#x2019;s relationship with the reader. In doing so, it introduces the reader to a number of key satirical writers such as Geoffrey Chaucer, Jonathan Swift, John Dryden, Samuel Johnson and Henry Fielding.\r\n\r\nThis book presents a comprehensive overview the genre and provides a useful starting point for those wishing to further study satirical literature","last_updated":"2018-08-20T12:01:31.452Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:c7248e04e63f6f92b6bcd83b21528de245a33665","dn":"Satire By Arthur Pollard 2017 [Routledge] ePub","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"c7248e04e63f6f92b6bcd83b21528de245a33665","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,36,142,4,230,63,111,146,182,188,216,59,33,82,141,226,69,163,54,101]},"name":"Satire By Arthur Pollard 2017 [Routledge] ePub","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
