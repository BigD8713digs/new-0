Crafty looked down the slope and realised what had happened to cause so much panic. Without warning, the dark wall of the Shole had advanced. \r\n\r\nCrafty can&apos;t remember a time before the Shole - the terrifying mist that has engulfed most of Britain, leaving those trapped in it to either die or be transformed into horrifying monsters: the aberrations. Crafty has been stuck in his family&apos;s cellar for nearly a year, his only companions his restless, whispering dead brothers and an unusually friendly aberration he names the Bog Queen.\r\n\r\nBut then Crafty&apos;s life abruptly changes. He is ordered to report to the Castle, where he will train as a gate grub - operators of magical portals that allow the mysterious guild of Gatemancers to explore within the Shole. It is a dangerous job, with a very short life expectancy.... \r\n\r\nTo survive, Crafty will have to use every inch of his cunning - whatever the cost.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-07-21T12:00:36.530Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:7078ee25bab08c746c2f2fd70ce31bba4308050e","dn":"The Beast Awakens by Joseph Delaney EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"7078ee25bab08c746c2f2fd70ce31bba4308050e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,120,238,37,186,176,140,116,108,47,47,215,12,227,27,186,67,8,5,14]},"name":"The Beast Awakens by Joseph Delaney EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
