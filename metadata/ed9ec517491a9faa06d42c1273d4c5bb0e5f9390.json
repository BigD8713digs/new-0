Beginning with the New York newsstand where Chomsky started his political education as a teenager, the discussion broadens out to encompass colonialism and imperial control, propaganda and the media, the Arab Spring and drone warfare. The authors offer a powerful critique of the legacy of colonialism, touching upon many countries including Syria, Nicaragua, Cuba, China, Chile and Turkey. \r\n\r\nContains a new foreword by Noam Chomsky","last_updated":"2017-05-09T19:33:46.243Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed9ec517491a9faa06d42c1273d4c5bb0e5f9390","dn":"On Western Terrorism - From Hiroshima to Drone Warfare (2017)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"ed9ec517491a9faa06d42c1273d4c5bb0e5f9390","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,158,197,23,73,26,159,170,6,212,44,18,115,212,197,187,14,95,147,144]},"name":"On Western Terrorism - From Hiroshima to Drone Warfare (2017)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
