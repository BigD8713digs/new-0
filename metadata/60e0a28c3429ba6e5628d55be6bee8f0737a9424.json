She&apos;s the Queen Bee of Magician WAGs (Wives and Girlfriends) and the real genius behind her philandering husband Jonathan&apos;s award-winning magic show, but her debilitating stage fright has kept her out of the limelight. Until Claire&apos;s life is upended by the arrival of two new women to the closed group of magicians&apos; wives - Jessica, a young trophy wife with a secret; and Kaimi, an art expert looking for the long-lost Erdnase papers by posing as a girlfriend. When a magician rivalry and a stolen routine erupt into murder, the women must uncover the truth and set things right for the men they love. With a cast of endurance experts, Vegas stage stars, close-up card handlers, and a pick-up artist or two, this glamorous novel weaves a tale of murder and fame and many, many illusions.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-07-26T12:01:35.166Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:60e0a28c3429ba6e5628d55be6bee8f0737a9424","dn":"Club Deception by Sarah Skilton EPUB MOBI eBOOK-ZAK","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"60e0a28c3429ba6e5628d55be6bee8f0737a9424","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,224,162,140,52,41,186,110,86,40,213,91,230,190,232,240,115,122,148,36]},"name":"Club Deception by Sarah Skilton EPUB MOBI eBOOK-ZAK","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
