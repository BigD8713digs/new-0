Philip Gabriel and Ted Goossen, trans. -- ePUB\n\n\nThe epic new novel from the internationally acclaimed and best-selling author of 1Q84\n\nIn Killing Commendatore, a thirty-something portrait painter in Tokyo is abandoned by his wife and finds himself holed up in the mountain home of a famous artist, Tomohiko Amada. When he discovers a previously unseen painting in the attic, he unintentionally opens a circle of mysterious circumstances. To close it, he must complete a journey that involves a mysterious ringing bell, a two-foot-high physical manifestation of an Idea, a dapper businessman who lives across the valley, a precocious thirteen-year-old girl, a Nazi assassination attempt during World War II in Vienna, a pit in the woods behind the artist&#x2019;s home, and an underworld haunted by Double Metaphors. A tour de force of love and loneliness, war and art&#x2014;as well as a loving homage to The Great Gatsby&#x2014;Killing Commendatore is a stunning work of imagination from one of our greatest writers.\n\n\nSEE ALSO:\n\nHaruki Murakami - Novels, Stories, and Non-fiction (24 books) <a href=\"\nhttps://thepiratebay.org/torrent/14646606/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://thepiratebay.org/torrent/14646606/</a>\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nCONTACT ME: You can reach me with comments, suggestions, requests, error reports, etc., at TPB&apos;s forum, SuprBay (you will need to register an account): <a href=\" https://pirates-forum.org/User-workerbee\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\"> https://pirates-forum.org/User-workerbee</a>  \n\nPLEASE HELP TO SEED!
