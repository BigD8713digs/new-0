Just press it, select a style. In an instant you get a stunning image with a backbone of balanced light, depth and realism. \r\nVisualize creativity like never before with the new Sky Light daylight simulator and the soft and fine shadow enhancements. Turn them on and watch as the foliage and grass become dramatically photorealistic. See the shadows beneath tables and shelves become subtle and soft. Notice as people, plants and buildings suddenly look like they belong where they are.  \r\n\r\nSoft and fine shadows \r\nDesigning and rendering realistic shadows may be one of the most difficult things you can do. Until now. \r\nIn Lumion 8, you can inject realism into your render by turning on the Soft Shadows and the Fine Detail Shadows as part of the Shadow effect. Instantly, the shadows become softer, the penumbras grow. Hundreds of fine detail shadows are enriched and a realistic sense of depth permeates the image. \r\nYou&#x2019;ll feel yourself smile as you view your unbuilt design looking uncannily like the real thing.  \r\n\r\nWhats New : \r\n <a href=\"\nhttps://lumion.com/what-s-new.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://lumion.com/what-s-new.html</a> \r\n\r\nMinimum System Requirements \r\n\r\nGraphics card: Minimum 2,000 PassMark points, 2GB memory or more and compatible with DirectX 11 or later.
