Years later, the Israeli has risen in the ranks to become a trusted advisor to Israel&apos;s prime minister, and throughout his career, he&apos;s been forced to share everything with the Kremlin. Now, however, a hint that there may be a traitor in the highest realms of power has slipped out, and a top-secret team is put together to hunt for him. The chase leads the team from the streets of Tel Aviv to deep inside the Russian zone and, finally, to the United States, where a most unique spymaster is revealed. The final showdown - between the traitor and the betrayed - can be resolved only by an act of utter treachery that could have far-reaching and devastating consequences.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-01-31T12:08:27.059Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe7daaadacc3ff2eefd6e8f11bed6545b71f7704","dn":"Traitor by Jonathan de Shalit EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"fe7daaadacc3ff2eefd6e8f11bed6545b71f7704","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,125,170,173,172,195,255,46,239,214,232,241,27,237,101,69,183,31,119,4]},"name":"Traitor by Jonathan de Shalit EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
