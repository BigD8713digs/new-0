Platt\r\n\r\nRequirements: .ePUB reader\r\n\r\nOverview: As China reclaims its position as a world power, Imperial Twilight looks back to tell the story of the country&apos;s last age of ascendance and how it came to an end in the nineteenth-century Opium War. \r\nWhen Britain launched its first war on China in 1839, pushed into hostilities by profiteering drug merchants and free-trade interests, it sealed the fate of what had long been seen as the most prosperous and powerful empire in Asia, if not the world. But internal problems of corruption, popular unrest, and dwindling finances had weakened China far more than was commonly understood, and the war would help set in motion the eventual fall of the Qing dynasty&#x2013;which, in turn, would lead to the rise of nationalism and communism in the twentieth century. As one of the most potent turning points in the country&apos;s modern history, the Opium War has since come to stand for everything that today&apos;s China seeks to put behind it. \r\n\r\nGenre: Non-Fiction &gt; History","last_updated":"2018-10-27T12:48:14.326Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:d41bb5b97bce3d3d7aa18029cc9d71120b0c8243","dn":"Imperial Twilight by Stephen R.
