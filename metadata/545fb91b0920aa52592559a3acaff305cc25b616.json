In the morning they give him a medal, and in the afternoon they send him back to school. That night he&#x2019;s off the grid. Out of sight, out of mind.\r\n\r\nTwo other men are in the classroom&#x2014;an FBI agent and a CIA analyst. Each is a first-rate operator, each is fresh off a big win, and each is wondering what the hell they are doing there.\r\n\r\nThen they find out: A Jihadist sleeper cell in Hamburg, Germany, has received an unexpected visitor&#x2014;a Saudi courier, seeking safe haven while waiting to rendezvous with persons unknown. A CIA asset, undercover inside the cell, has overheard the courier whisper a chilling message: &#x201C;The American wants a hundred million dollars.&#x201D;\r\n\r\nFor what? And who from? Reacher and his two new friends are told to find the American. Reacher recruits the best soldier he has ever worked with: Sergeant Frances Neagley. Their mission heats up in more ways than one, while always keeping their eyes on the prize: If they don&#x2019;t get their man, the world will suffer an epic act of terrorism","last_updated":"2017-09-16T12:11:30.317Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:545fb91b0920aa52592559a3acaff305cc25b616","dn":"Lee Clild-Night School","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"545fb91b0920aa52592559a3acaff305cc25b616","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,95,185,27,9,32,170,82,89,37,89,163,172,175,243,5,204,37,182,22]},"name":"Lee Clild-Night School","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
