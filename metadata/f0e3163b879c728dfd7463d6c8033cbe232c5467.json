So, the app can look into many areas of the Windows Registry, such as unused file extensions, ActiveX and COM issues, missing or invalid type libraries, and spyware entries.\r\n\r\nOn top of that, the tool may be set to clean up the disk (e.g. invalid start menu items, Internet Explorer cache, Windows temporary files, Recycle Bin) and to remove traces from your system (e.g. recent documents list, start menu Run list, MS Office recent files, Internet Explorer cookies and typed URLs).\r\n\r\nOnce the scanning procedure is done, you can find out the total items of scanned registry entries, cookies and files, discovered errors and elapsed time. So, you can select which issues you want to resolve, and let NETGATE Registry Cleaner take care of the procedure.\r\n\r\nIn addition, you can backup and restore data, manage applications which automatically run at system startup, uninstall programs from your computer, and schedule tasks (once or on a regular basis). But you can also make NETGATE Registry Cleaner automatically run at Windows boot, enable shields (e.g. startup programs, IE search page), as well as configure proxy and IE search page settings.\r\n\r\nThe program requires a low-to-moderate amount of CPU and system memory, has a good response time, quickly finishes a scan and clean job, and includes tips for users. No errors have occurred during our evaluation and NETGATE Registry Cleaner did not freeze or crash. First-time users could take a while to get familiarized to the app&#x2019;s features","last_updated":"2018-11-21T12:10:01.752Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:f0e3163b879c728dfd7463d6c8033cbe232c5467","dn":"NETGATE Registry Cleaner 18.0.300.0   Medicine[BabuPC]","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"f0e3163b879c728dfd7463d6c8033cbe232c5467","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,227,22,59,135,156,114,141,253,116,99,214,200,3,60,190,35,44,84,103]},"name":"NETGATE Registry Cleaner 18.0.300.0   Medicine[BabuPC]","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
