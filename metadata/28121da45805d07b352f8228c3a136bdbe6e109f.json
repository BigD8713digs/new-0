Alan is reeling, torn about the new child that&apos;s not his and suddenly unsure about any of his commitments. His shock is almost as great as that of Jack, a college junior who suddenly finds out he&apos;s a father, and whose identity is discovered as he is juggling finals, his fraternity, a fund shortage, and two girlfriends. Frank, funny, and forthright, Expecting is the fascinating story of three people bound together by a fateful mistake, and a thoughtful exploration of what it really means to be a parent.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-04-11T15:21:55.607Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:28121da45805d07b352f8228c3a136bdbe6e109f","dn":"Expecting by Ann Lewis Hamilton EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"28121da45805d07b352f8228c3a136bdbe6e109f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,18,29,164,88,5,208,123,53,47,130,40,195,161,54,189,190,110,16,159]},"name":"Expecting by Ann Lewis Hamilton EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
