But it&#x2019;s not only Kathy who&#x2019;s changing. Political, social and natural landscapes are all in peril. Fascism is on the rise, truth is dead, the planet is hotting up. Is it really worth learning to love when the end of the world is nigh? And how do you make art, let alone a life, when one rogue tweet could end it all.\r\n\r\nOlivia Laing radically rewires the novel in a brilliant, funny and emphatically raw account of love in the apocalypse. A Goodbye to Berlin for the 21st century, Crudo charts in real time what it was like to live and love in the horrifying summer of 2017, from the perspective of a commitment-phobic peripatetic artist who may or may not be Kathy Acker \r\n\r\n\r\n     <a href=\"\nhttps://pirates-forum.org/Forum-Requests\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://pirates-forum.org/Forum-Requests</a>","last_updated":"2018-07-17T12:01:27.546Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:f34f774ef61366e79efc60b52852d5b406469d21","dn":"Olivia Laing - Crudo: A Novel (epub)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"f34f774ef61366e79efc60b52852d5b406469d21","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,79,119,78,246,19,102,231,158,252,96,181,40,82,213,180,6,70,157,33]},"name":"Olivia Laing - Crudo: A Novel (epub)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
