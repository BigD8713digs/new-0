Your Ugly Houses&quot; (a sideswipe at the non-taste of the celebrities featured in Hello magazine), &quot;Enough Is Enough&quot; (originally recorded with Brit rappers Credit to the Nation) and the catchy/cloying &quot;Timebomb.&quot; \r\nMost of the material is taken from Anarchy (1994) and Swingin&apos; With Raymond (1996). &quot;Mouthful of Shit,&quot; the highlight of Anarchy, makes a welcome return. \r\n20 tracks is surely enough Chumbawamba for even the hardiest of die-hards, but if you don&apos;t have the studio albums, this is the best place to start.
