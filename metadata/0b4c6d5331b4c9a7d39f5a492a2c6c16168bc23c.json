They vanished from history leaving scarcely a trace, lost to fire, censorship, theft, war or deliberate destruction, yet those who seek them are convinced they will find them. \r\nThis is the story of one man&apos;s quest for eight mysterious lost books. \r\n\r\nTaking us from Florence to Regency London, the Russian Steppe to British Columbia, Giorgio van Straten unearths stories of infamy and tragedy, glimmers of hope and bitter twists of fate. There are, among others, the rediscovered masterpiece that he read but failed to save from destruction; the Hemingway novel that vanished in a suitcase at the Gare du Lyon; the memoirs of Lord Byron, burnt to avoid a scandal; the Magnum Opus of Bruno Schulz, disappeared along with its author in wartime Poland; the mythical Sylvia Plath novel that may one day become reality. \r\n\r\nAs gripping as a detective novel, as moving as an elegy, this is the tale of a love affair with the impossible, of the things that slip away from us but which, sometimes, live again in the stories we tell.\r\n\r\nGenre: Non-Fiction &gt; History","last_updated":"2018-10-06T12:29:44.636Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b4c6d5331b4c9a7d39f5a492a2c6c16168bc23c","dn":"In Search of Lost Books by Giorgio Van Straten (.epub)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"0b4c6d5331b4c9a7d39f5a492a2c6c16168bc23c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,76,109,83,49,180,201,167,211,159,90,73,42,44,108,22,22,139,194,60]},"name":"In Search of Lost Books by Giorgio Van Straten (.epub)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
