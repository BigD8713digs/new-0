Bacon was born with malformed legs, but with the help of a wheelchair made of construction toys, he&#x2019;s become a hero to people with similar challenges.\r\nNancy Furstinger profiles Chris P. Bacon and many other animals in Unstoppable&#x2014;all of whom are making their way around with the help of prosthetics, braces, orthotics and wheelchairs! Readers will meet the caretakers, prosthetists, vets, and loving families that help to make recovery possible. Furstinger offers a glimpse into the cutting-edge technologies, such as 3D printing and brain-controlled prosthetics, that are helping to improve the lives of animals and humans alike.\r\n\r\nAbout the Author <a href=\"\nhttps://s1.postimg.org/5y2v7u4by7/Nancy.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://s1.postimg.org/5y2v7u4by7/Nancy.jpg</a>\r\nNancy Furstinger has been speaking up for animals since she learned to talk--and she hasn&apos;t shut up yet. Nancy volunteers for an assortment of humane societies and rescue groups, and she has been a vegetarian since the age of 16. She is also the author of more than 100 books, including many on her favorite topic: animals!
