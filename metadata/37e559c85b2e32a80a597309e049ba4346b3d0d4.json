Evaluativity has traditionally been associated exclusively with the positive construction, a term for sentences with a gradable adjective but with no overt degree morphology. John is tall is evaluative because it entails that John is tall relative to a contextually valued standard. John is taller than Sue and John is as tall as Sue are not evaluative because both could be used even if John and Sue were short. \r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n <a href=\"\nhttp://dlfeb.com/book/semantics-of-evaluativity-oxford-studies-in-theoretical-linguistics/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttp://dlfeb.com/book/semantics-of-evaluativity-oxford-studies-in-theoretical-linguistics/</a>","last_updated":"2017-07-23T12:01:19.187Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:37e559c85b2e32a80a597309e049ba4346b3d0d4","dn":"THE SEMANTICS OF EVALUATIVITY ","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"37e559c85b2e32a80a597309e049ba4346b3d0d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,229,89,200,91,46,50,168,10,89,115,9,224,73,186,67,70,179,208,212]},"name":"THE SEMANTICS OF EVALUATIVITY ","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
