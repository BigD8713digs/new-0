The citizens of France are enlivened by the ideals of liberty, equality, and fraternity. The monarchy of King Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette has been dismantled - with the help of the guillotine - and a new nation is rising in its place. Jean-Luc, an idealistic young lawyer, moves his wife, Marie, and their infant son from their comfortable life in Marseille to Paris in the hopes of joining the cause. Andr&#xE9;, the son of a denounced duke, has evaded execution by joining the new French army. And Sophie, a beautiful aristocratic widow, embarks on her own fight for independence against her powerful, vindictive uncle.\r\n\r\nAs chaos threatens to undo the progress of the Revolution and the demand for justice breeds instability and paranoia, the lives of these compatriots become inextricably linked. Jean-Luc, Andr&#xE9;, and Sophie find themselves in a world where survival seems increasingly less likely - for themselves and, indeed, for the nation.\r\n\r\nFeaturing cameos from legendary figures such as Maximilien Robespierre, King Louis XVI, and Alexandre Dumas, Where the Light Falls is an epic and engrossing novel, moving from the streets and courtrooms of Paris to Napoleon&apos;s epic march across the burning sands of Egypt. With vivid detail and imagery, the Patakis capture the hearts and minds of the citizens of France fighting for truth above all and for their beliefs in a cause greater than themselves.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-10-07T12:00:55.709Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:b03c25fea4fb9838c967cf4855ecc00dbf99655f","dn":"Where the Light Falls_ A Novel of the French Revolution by Allis","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"b03c25fea4fb9838c967cf4855ecc00dbf99655f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,60,37,254,164,251,152,56,201,103,207,72,85,236,192,13,191,153,101,95]},"name":"Where the Light Falls_ A Novel of the French Revolution by Allis","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
