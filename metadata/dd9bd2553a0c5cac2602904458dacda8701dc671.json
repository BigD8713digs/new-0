Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) doesn&apos;t steal things, he steals ideas. By projecting himself deep into the subconscious of his targets, he can glean information that even the best computer hackers can&apos;t get to. In the world of corporate espionage, Cobb is the ultimate weapon. But even weapons have their weakness, and when Cobb loses everything, he&apos;s forced to embark on one final mission in a desperate quest for redemption. This time, Cobb won&apos;t be harvesting an idea, but sowing one. Should he and his team of specialists succeed, they will have discovered a new frontier in the art of psychic espionage. They&apos;ve planned everything to perfection, and they have all the tools to get the job done. Their mission is complicated, however, by the sudden appearance of a malevolent foe that seems to know exactly what they&apos;re up to, and precisely how to stop them.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTARS.........: Leonardo DiCaprio, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page\r\nDIRECTOR......: Christopher Nolan\r\nWRITERS.......: Christopher Nolan\r\nGENRE.........: Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi\r\nMETASCORE.....: 74\r\nTOMATOMETER...: 86\r\nIMDB RATING...: 8.8/10  1,664,323 votes\r\nIMDB LINK.....: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1375666\r\nRUNTIME.......: 1h 36mn\r\nSIZE..........: 4.94 GB\r\nVIDEO CODEC...: HEVC (<a href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection\" class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"c489a5adaa8488f0\">[email&#xA0;protected]</a>)\r\nBITRATE.......: 4000 Kbps (2-pass)\r\nRESOLUTION....: 1920x800\r\nASPECT RATIO..: 2.40:1\r\nFRAMERATE.....: 23.976 fps\r\nAUDIO.........: English E-AC3 5.1 768kbps\r\nSUBTITLES.....: ENG\r\nCHAPTERS......: Yes\r\nSOURCE........: Inception.2010.Blu-ray.Remux.1080p.VC-1.DTS-HD.MA-HomeTheater\r\nENCODED BY....: Sartre\r\nENCODE DATE...: 2018-01-16","last_updated":"2018-01-25T12:11:35.484Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd9bd2553a0c5cac2602904458dacda8701dc671","dn":"Inception.2010.1080p.BluRay.HEVC.EAC3-SARTRE","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"dd9bd2553a0c5cac2602904458dacda8701dc671","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,155,210,85,58,12,92,172,38,2,144,68,88,218,205,168,112,29,198,113]},"name":"Inception.2010.1080p.BluRay.HEVC.EAC3-SARTRE","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
