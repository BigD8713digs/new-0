When his father decides to move the family to Canada and sell the animals to American zoos, everyone boards a Japanese cargo ship. The ship sinks, and 16-year-old Pi finds himself alone on a lifeboat with a hyena, an orangutan, a zebra with a broken leg, and a 450-pound Bengal tiger.\r\n\r\nSoon it&apos;s just Pi, the tiger, and the vast Pacific Ocean - for 227 days. Pi&apos;s fear, knowledge, and cunning keep him alive until they reach the coast of Mexico, where the tiger disappears into the jungle. The Japanese authorities who interrogate Pi refuse to believe his story, so he tells a second one - more conventional, less fantastic. But is it more true?\r\n\r\nA realistic, rousing adventure and meta-tale of survival, Life of Pi explores the redemptive power of storytelling and the transformative nature of fiction. It&apos;s a story, as one character claims, to &quot;make you believe in God&quot;.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-07-22T12:00:26.640Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ab59dd7e66bbd9b53953faf84ff488e0097452f","dn":"Life of Pi by Yann Martel epub RtR","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"7ab59dd7e66bbd9b53953faf84ff488e0097452f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,181,157,215,230,107,189,155,83,149,63,175,132,255,72,142,0,151,69,47]},"name":"Life of Pi by Yann Martel epub RtR","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
