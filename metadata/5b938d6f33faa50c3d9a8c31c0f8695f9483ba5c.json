Then she unpacks seven essential money habits for living the life we really want - a life in line with our values, where we can afford the things we want to buy without being buried under debt, stress, and worry. The Joneses are broke. Life looks good, but hidden beneath that glossy exterior are credit card bills, student loans, car payments, and an out-of-control mortgage. Their money situation is a mess, and they&apos;re trying to live a life they simply can&apos;t afford. So why exactly do we try so hard to keep up with the Joneses? Are we really living the lives we want, or are we chasing someone else&apos;s dream, just trying to keep up appearances on social media, at church, and in our community? Why are we letting other people set the pace for our own family&apos;s finances?\r\n\r\nIn Love Your Life, Not Theirs, Rachel shows you how to buy and do the things that are important to you - the right way. That starts by choosing to quit the comparisons, reframing the way you think about money, and developing new habits like avoiding debt, living on a plan, watching your spending, saving for the future, having healthy conversations about money, and giving. These habits work, and Rachel is living proof. Now, she wants to empower you to live the life you&apos;ve always dreamed of without creating the debt, stress, and worry that are all too often part of the deal. Social media isn&apos;t real life, and trying to keep up with the Joneses will never get you anywhere. It&apos;s time to live - and love - your life, not theirs.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-11-23T12:04:52.077Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b938d6f33faa50c3d9a8c31c0f8695f9483ba5c","dn":"Love Your Life, Not Theirs by Rachel Cruze EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"5b938d6f33faa50c3d9a8c31c0f8695f9483ba5c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,147,141,111,51,250,165,12,61,154,140,49,192,248,105,95,148,131,186,92]},"name":"Love Your Life, Not Theirs by Rachel Cruze EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
