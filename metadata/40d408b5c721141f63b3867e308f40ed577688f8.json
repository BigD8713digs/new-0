Fans know what to expect: lots of weird, sumptuous and virtuosic noise from two of the world&apos;s foremost avant-gardists. The music is always arrythmic and without anything approaching melody, yet it&apos;s never unapproachable; there&apos;s something sweet-natured about the clatter and whine these two musicians make together, and even those without an already-developed interest in noise music should be able to appreciate its textural complexity and Cutler and Frith&apos;s endless inventiveness. - Rick Anderson, AMG","last_updated":"2017-06-17T12:01:17.155Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:40d408b5c721141f63b3867e308f40ed577688f8","dn":"Chris Cutler &amp; Fred Frith 1994 Trondheim-Berlin-Limoges","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"40d408b5c721141f63b3867e308f40ed577688f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,212,8,181,199,33,20,31,99,179,134,126,48,143,64,237,87,118,136,248]},"name":"Chris Cutler &amp; Fred Frith 1994 Trondheim-Berlin-Limoges","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
