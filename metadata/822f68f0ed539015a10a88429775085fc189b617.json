No previous knowledge of parallelism is required. This book also provides for the more advanced technical programmer seeking to go beyond high level parallel frameworks","last_updated":"2017-07-18T12:01:53.250Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:822f68f0ed539015a10a88429775085fc189b617","dn":"Mastering Parallel Programming with R by Simon R.
