That simple discovery launched a scientific race that spanned three continents. In Great Britain and the United States, Soviet spies worked their way into the scientific community; in Norway, a commando force slipped behind enemy lines to attack German heavy-water manufacturing; and deep in the desert, one brilliant group of scientists was hidden away at a remote site at Los Alamos.\r\n\r\nThis is the story of the plotting, the risk-taking, the deceit, and genius that created the world&apos;s most formidable weapon. This is the story of the atomic bomb.\r\n\r\nBomb was a 2012 National Book Awards finalist for Young People&apos;s Literature.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-08-31T12:00:40.854Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:e4332fb167eb43fae46fee32841bea3f24a14712","dn":"Bomb_ The Race to Build - and Steal - the World's Most Dangerous","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"e4332fb167eb43fae46fee32841bea3f24a14712","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,51,47,177,103,235,67,250,228,111,238,50,132,27,234,63,36,161,71,18]},"name":"Bomb_ The Race to Build - and Steal - the World's Most Dangerous","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
