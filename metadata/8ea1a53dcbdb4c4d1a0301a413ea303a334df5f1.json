For the world&apos;s greatest cultural icon still has secrets to reveal&#x2013;not the silly secrets that the &quot;Leonardo loonies&quot; continue to advance, but previously unknown facts about the lives of Leonardo, his father, Lisa Gherardini, the subject of the portrait, and her husband Francesco del Giocondo. From this factual beginning we see how the painting metamorphosed into a &quot;universal picture&quot; that became the prime vehicle for Leonardo&apos;s prodigious knowledge of the human and natural worlds. \r\n\r\nWe learn about the new money of the ambitious merchant who married into the old gentry of Lisa&apos;s family. We discover Lisa&apos;s life as a wife and mother, her association with sexual scandals, and her later life in a convent. We meet, for the first time, the illegitimate Leonardo&apos;s real mother and find out where he was really born. The tiny hill town of Vinci is placed before us, with its widespread poverty. We find out about the career and possessions of his father, a notable lawyer in Florence.\r\n\r\nGenre: Non-Fiction &gt; General","last_updated":"2018-09-15T12:17:43.807Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ea1a53dcbdb4c4d1a0301a413ea303a334df5f1","dn":"Mona Lisa by Martin Kemp, Giuseppe Pallanti (.epub)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"8ea1a53dcbdb4c4d1a0301a413ea303a334df5f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,161,165,61,203,219,76,77,26,3,1,164,19,234,48,58,51,77,245,241]},"name":"Mona Lisa by Martin Kemp, Giuseppe Pallanti (.epub)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
