First, he lost a pair of Oakley sunglasses. Second, he saved the life of President Ulysses S. Grant.\r\n\r\nIn the near future of Robert Charles Wilson&apos;s Last Year, the technology exists to open doorways into the past - but not our past, not exactly. Each &quot;past&quot; is effectively an alternate world, identical to ours but only up to the date on which we access it. And a given &quot;past&quot; can be reached only once. After a passageway is open, it&apos;s the only road to that particular past; once closed, it can&apos;t be reopened.\r\n\r\nA passageway has been opened to a version of late 19th-century Ohio. It&apos;s been in operation for most of a decade, but it&apos;s no secret on either side of time. A small city has grown up around it to entertain visitors from our time, and many locals earn a good living catering to them. But like all such operations, it has a shelf life; as the &quot;natives&quot; become more sophisticated, their version of the &quot;past&quot; grows less attractive as a destination.\r\n\r\nJesse Cullum is a native. And he knows the passageway will be closing soon. He&apos;s fallen in love with a woman from our time, and he means to follow her back - no matter whose secrets he has to expose in order to do it.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-10-26T12:00:45.234Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec830e0114735a098a4d69725278f45a58907241","dn":"Last Year by Robert Charles Wilson EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"ec830e0114735a098a4d69725278f45a58907241","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,131,14,1,20,115,90,9,138,77,105,114,82,120,244,90,88,144,114,65]},"name":"Last Year by Robert Charles Wilson EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
