Singh (AP, 2016).pdf\r\n\r\nEngineered Nanoparticles: Structure, Properties and Mechanisms of Toxicity is an indispensable introduction to engineered nanomaterials (ENM) and their potential adverse effects on human health and the environment. Although research in the area of pharmacology and toxicology of ENM is rapidly advancing, a possible correlation between their physicochemical properties and biomedical properties or toxicity is not yet fully understood. This understanding is essential to develop strategies for the safe applications and handling of ENM.\r\n\r\nThe book comprehensively defines the current understanding of ENM toxicity, first describing these materials and their physicochemical properties, and then discussing the toxicological theory and methodology before finally demonstrating the potential impact of ENM on the environment and human health.\r\n\r\nIt represents an essential reference for students and investigators in toxicology, pharmacology, chemistry, material sciences, medicine, and those in related disciplines who require an introduction to ENM and their potential toxicological effects.\r\n\r\nProvides state-of-the-art physicochemical descriptions and methodologies for the characterization of engineered nanomaterials (ENM)\r\nDescribes the potential toxicological effects of ENM and the nanotoxicological mechanisms of action\r\nPresents how to apply theory to practice in a public health and risk assessment setting","last_updated":"2017-05-31T12:00:56.850Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:52d69b1febb15b1efca693603cfecbcdf914bf7a","dn":"Engineered Nanoparticles - Structure, Properties and Mechanisms ","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"52d69b1febb15b1efca693603cfecbcdf914bf7a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,214,155,31,235,177,91,30,252,166,147,96,60,254,203,205,249,20,191,122]},"name":"Engineered Nanoparticles - Structure, Properties and Mechanisms ","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
