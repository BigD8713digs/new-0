This is not a fault of the encode, it is inherent on the original Bluray and seems to be a known issue.\r\n2) All audio is DTS-HD 2.0 except for Dr Phibes Rises Again, which was LPCM 2.0 which I converted to AC3 2.0 -for maximum compatibility\r\n3) I did no cropping. While I have no issue with cropping I understand it may improve the use of these videos for others.\r\n4) There were no subs on the discs so tough shit on that one.\r\n5) Why 10 bit? Even though though the source is 8 bit (eg 24 bit True Colour) it turns out most encodes include dithering to create colours that could not otherwise be accurately represented with 8 bits. Dithering requires high-band-width. 10 bit theoretically reduces band-width and therefore file size. It also offers higher fault tolerance: If there are any error-bits it has less impact on resulting colour. Lastly it can also potentially reduce colour banding.\r\n6) For the love of god seed, at least to a 1.0 ratio. If you don&apos;t want to seed because there is something about these rips you don&apos;t like tell me what it is so I know what I need to improve. Personally I think these are very high quality encodes given the source material and I&apos;m really not sure how I could make them better. If you refuse to seed because you just don&apos;t want to then bascially you are a douche and sadly there is no cure for that","last_updated":"2018-07-14T12:12:37.145Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:01edc076fd68a890bb7020bfa8eb565999433418","dn":"Vincent Price Collection 1080p Bluray x265 10bit.","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"01edc076fd68a890bb7020bfa8eb565999433418","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,237,192,118,253,104,168,144,187,112,32,191,168,235,86,89,153,67,52,24]},"name":"Vincent Price Collection 1080p Bluray x265 10bit.","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
