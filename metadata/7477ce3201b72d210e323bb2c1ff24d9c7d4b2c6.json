This is good news for all of us. It frees us up to talk about the most important part of our lives in a way that&#x2019;s natural, meaningful, and helpful instead of clumsy, awkward, and irrelevant.\r\n\r\nAnyone who has spent countless uncomfortable hours walking from house to house with a clipboard or flash cards that talk about four spiritual laws understands.\r\n\r\nJesus&#x2019; conversations were remarkably simple. Contemporary Christian lingo has set up a dichotomy between what we call &#x201C;discipleship&#x201D; and &#x201C;evangelism&#x201D;, but the Bible doesn&#x2019;t do that. Jesus had conversations all the time with those who thought they were close to God, as well as with those who deemed themselves lost and without hope. He invited all of them to come and learn from Him.\r\n\r\n42 Seconds is a simple book that uses the ordinary moments of our lives the way Jesus used the same moments in his own. The premise is straightforward: If we can learn from Jesus how to have great conversations, it will change our lives and the lives of those around us.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-06-16T12:12:48.462Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:7477ce3201b72d210e323bb2c1ff24d9c7d4b2c6","dn":"42 Seconds by Carl Medearis EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"7477ce3201b72d210e323bb2c1ff24d9c7d4b2c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,119,206,50,1,183,45,33,14,50,59,178,193,255,36,217,199,212,178,198]},"name":"42 Seconds by Carl Medearis EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
