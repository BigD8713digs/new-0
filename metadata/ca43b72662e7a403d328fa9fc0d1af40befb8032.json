The Song Prize was first won by legendary Welsh baritone Bryn Terfel when it was introduced back in 1989. For this final the orchestra has been replaced by a piano as five singers aim to impress an expert panel of judges in the intimate and demanding discipline of &apos;art song&apos; or lieder. On hand to discuss their performances are acclaimed lyric tenor John Mark Ainsley and leading vocal coach Mary King.\r\n\r\n(with soft subtitles) \r\n\r\nFirst broadcast: 17 July 2017\r\nDuration:  90 minutes","last_updated":"2017-06-18T12:04:55.229Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca43b72662e7a403d328fa9fc0d1af40befb8032","dn":"BBC Cardiff Singer of the World 2017 Song Prize Final","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"ca43b72662e7a403d328fa9fc0d1af40befb8032","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,67,183,38,98,231,164,3,211,40,250,159,192,209,175,64,190,251,128,50]},"name":"BBC Cardiff Singer of the World 2017 Song Prize Final","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
