Returner Ryan Simson-Trotman, who failed to reach the national finals last year, is originally from Nuneaton and opened his own restaurant Orwells in the Oxfordshire countryside with his partner Liam, who is also a contestant in the north west region. Newcomer Marianne Lumb has 20 years&apos; experience catering for distinguished clientele who demand perfection. Born in Leicestershire, she worked as a private chef and now runs her own restaurant Marianne, which, seating just 14, is London&apos;s smallest fine-dining restaurant. And fellow first timer, Wolverhampton-born Sabrina Gidda, is a two-time Roux Scholarship finalist whose fusion cooking combines flavours from all over the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal Air Dates: 03-Sep-2018 to 07-Sep-2018","last_updated":"2018-10-13T12:29:39.174Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:714c2273529674f3c3d81685047c6d5faf1c8dc9","dn":"Great British Menu S13E16-E20 Central 480p HDTV x264 RMTeam","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"714c2273529674f3c3d81685047c6d5faf1c8dc9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,76,34,115,82,150,116,243,195,216,22,133,4,124,109,95,175,28,141,201]},"name":"Great British Menu S13E16-E20 Central 480p HDTV x264 RMTeam","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
