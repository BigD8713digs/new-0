She knows he&#x2019;s a killer. Who do you believe?\r\nIn the shadow of a mountain in small-town Tasmania, a woman named Ana is watching the clock, marking the days until she ends her life.\r\n\r\nThe strange, reclusive daughter of the local pariah, that&#x2019;s how people will remember her, when they remember her at all. No one will mourn her, she reasons, not really. Not even her faithful dog River. The only thing she&#x2019;s waiting for is the opportunity.\r\nBut then, on the very day she planned to end it all, the police find the body of local woman Rebecca Marsden. And for Ana, that changes everything. Because Ana was the last person to see Rebecca alive. Because Ana thinks she knows who killed her. And because Ana has decided to keep him for herself&#x2026;","last_updated":"2018-06-29T12:14:03.191Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:4310c9d4bac5d3f939d10de287750040b153cf0e","dn":"Lynne Vincent McCarthy-Lonely Girl [epub]","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"4310c9d4bac5d3f939d10de287750040b153cf0e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,16,201,212,186,197,211,249,57,209,13,226,135,117,0,64,177,83,207,14]},"name":"Lynne Vincent McCarthy-Lonely Girl [epub]","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
