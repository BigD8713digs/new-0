This book uses exposition and examples to help you understand major concepts in this complicated field.\r\n\r\nLarge companies such as Google, Microsoft, andhave taken notice, and are actively growing in-house deep learning teams. For the rest of us however, deep learning is still a pretty complex and difficult subject to grasp. If you have a basic understanding of what machine learning is, have familiarity with the Python programming language, and have some mathematical background with calculus, this book will help you get started.\r\nTable of Contents\r\n\r\nChapter 1.
