Born\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can take Michael Bennett out of New York City, but you can&apos;t take the cop out of Michael Bennett.\r\nDetective Michael Bennett is ready for a vacation after a series of crises push him, and his family, to the brink. He settles on an idyllic, small town in the beautiful Maine woods, a recommendation from a former colleague. But just when Bennett thinks he can relax, he gets pulled into a case that has shocked the tight-knit community. Kids are disappearing left and right with no explanation-until several bodies turn up in the woods. As Bennett investigates, he discovers that the seemingly perfect town is reeling from a deadly addiction, and the violence is about to reach a fever pitch. Far from the city streets he knows so well, Bennett faces off against a horrific evil next door that threatens a town, the law, and the family that Bennett loves above all else","last_updated":"2017-09-20T12:12:00.516Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e7924520342aad276c2c54ee70796e61b7e539d","dn":"Haunted by James Patterson, James O.
