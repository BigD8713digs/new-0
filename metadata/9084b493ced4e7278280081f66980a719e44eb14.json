She doesn&apos;t care what anyone thinks of her. She likes a beer and a shot and wouldn&apos;t be caught dead wearing anything fashionable. She&apos;s inherited her father&apos;s run-down house on Martha&apos;s Vineyard, but she can&apos;t hold down a job, and her latest romantic disaster has the entire island talking.\r\n\r\nTwo beautiful islands only 11 miles apart.\r\n\r\nTabitha Frost is dignified, refined. She prefers a fine wine and has inherited the impeccable taste of her mother, the iconic fashion designer Eleanor Roxie-Frost. She&apos;s also inherited her mother&apos;s questionable parenting skills - Tabitha&apos;s teenage daughter, Ainsley, is in full rebellion mode - and a flailing fashion boutique on Nantucket in desperate need of a cash infusion.\r\n\r\nOne unforgettable summer that will change their lives forever.\r\n\r\nAfter more than a decade apart, Harper and Tabitha switch islands - and lives - to save what&apos;s left of their splintered family. But the twins quickly discover that the secrets, lies, and gossip they thought they&apos;d outrun can travel between islands just as easily as they can. Will Harper and Tabitha be able to bury the hatchet and end their sibling rivalry once and for all? Before the last beach picnic of the season, there will be enough old resentments, new loves, and cases of mistaken identity to make this the most talked about summer that Martha&apos;s Vineyard and Nantucket have experienced in ages.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-08-27T12:03:30.799Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:9084b493ced4e7278280081f66980a719e44eb14","dn":"The Identicals_ A Novel by Elin Hilderbrand ePUB eBOOK-ZAK","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"9084b493ced4e7278280081f66980a719e44eb14","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,132,180,147,206,212,231,39,130,128,8,31,102,152,10,113,158,68,235,20]},"name":"The Identicals_ A Novel by Elin Hilderbrand ePUB eBOOK-ZAK","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
