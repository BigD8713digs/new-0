Weymouth EPUB\r\n\r\nWhat happens when you return to the real world after being in a fantastical one like Narnia? This YA debut by Laura E. Weymouth is perfect for fans of Melissa Albert&#x2019;s The Hazel Wood and Lev Grossman&#x2019;s The Magicians.\r\n\r\nSix years ago, sisters Evelyn and Philippa Hapwell were swept away to a strange and beautiful kingdom called the Woodlands, where they lived for years. But ever since they returned to their lives in post-WWII England, they have struggled to adjust.\r\n\r\nEv desperately wants to return to the Woodlands, and Philippa just wants to move on. When Ev goes missing, Philippa must confront the depth of her sister&#x2019;s despair and the painful truths from which they&#x2019;ve been running. As the weeks unfold, Philippa wonders if Ev truly did find a way home or if the weight of their worlds pulled her under.\r\n\r\nWalking the line between where fantasy and reality meet, this lyrical and magical novel is, above all else, an exploration of loss and healing and what it means to find where you belong. \r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-10-25T12:01:17.415Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:28a9d4bca2d69e79a7cc8e3574e83193fbd3d4da","dn":"The Light Between Worlds by Laura E.
