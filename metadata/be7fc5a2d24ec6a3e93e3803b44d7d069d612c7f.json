Cherry-Garrard, whom Scott lauded as a tough, efficient member of the team, tells of the journey from England to South Africa and southward to the ice floes. From there began the unforgettable polar journey across a forbidding and inhospitable region. On November 12, 1912, in arctic temperatures, the author, in a search party, found the bodies of Scott and his companions along with poignant last notebook entries, some of them recorded in this work.\r\n\r\nAmong Apsley Cherry-Garrard&apos;s friends and admirers were John Galsworthy, H. G. Wells, Arnold Bennett, and Bernard Shaw. His background in the arts and humanities makes The Worst Journey in the World stand out as a literary accomplishment as well as a classic in the annals of exploration.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-12-10T12:08:44.313Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:be7fc5a2d24ec6a3e93e3803b44d7d069d612c7f","dn":"The Worst Journey in the World by Apsley Cherry-Garrard EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"be7fc5a2d24ec6a3e93e3803b44d7d069d612c7f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,127,197,162,210,78,198,163,233,62,56,3,180,77,125,6,157,97,44,127]},"name":"The Worst Journey in the World by Apsley Cherry-Garrard EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
