Adapted by Edward Anhalt from the book by Gerold Frank, the film covers the years 1962 to 1964, during which time a dozen women were raped and murdered in the Boston area. State-appointed officer John Bottomly (Henry Fonda) arrests as many known sex offenders as he can get his hands on in hopes of finding a clue as to the Boston Strangler&apos;s identity. Well-played by Tony Curtis (whose makeup is startling), DeSalvo himself does not appear until an hour into the film. When caught, the schizophrenic DeSalvo insists that he knows nothing of the murders. Under interrogation and hypnosis, his homicidal impulses are exposed. Meticulously cast, The Boston Strangler offers excellent vignettes by Sally Kellerman as the Strangler&apos;s only surviving victim and by Hurd Hatfield as an erudite sex pervert.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTARS.........: Tony Curtis, Henry Fonda, George Kennedy\r\nDIRECTOR......: Richard Fleischer\r\nWRITERS.......: Edward Anhalt (screenplay), Gerold Frank (book)\r\nGENRE.........: Crime, Drama, Mystery\r\nTOMATOMETER...: 86\r\nIMDB RATING...: 7.1/10  6,974 votes\r\nIMDB LINK.....: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062755\r\nRUNTIME.......: 1h 56mn\r\nSIZE..........: 4.54 GB\r\nVIDEO CODEC...: HEVC (Main@L4)\r\nBITRATE.......: 5000 Kbps (2-pass)\r\nRESOLUTION....: 1920x816\r\nASPECT RATIO..: 2.35:1\r\nFRAMERATE.....: 23.976 fps\r\nAUDIO1........: English E-AC3 3.0 320kbps\r\nAUDIO2........: English AAC Mono 192kbps\r\nAUDIO3........: Commentary with Film historians David Del Valle and Steven Peros\r\nSUBTITLES.....: ENG\r\nCHAPTERS......: Yes\r\nSOURCE........: Twilight Time Blu-Ray\r\nENCODED BY....: Sartre\r\nENCODE DATE...: 2018-08-28\r\n\r\n\r\nExtras\r\n\r\n- Split-Screen Personality\r\n- Real Killer, Fake Nose\r\n- AMC Backstory: &apos;The Boston Strangler&apos;\r\n- Fox MovieTone Newsreel\r\n- Trailers","last_updated":"2018-09-20T12:19:19.564Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0461579a625a9277d22ccf6c37f48583f48fbdc","dn":"The.Boston.Strangler.1968.1080p.BluRay.x265.HEVC.EAC3-SARTRE","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"e0461579a625a9277d22ccf6c37f48583f48fbdc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,70,21,121,166,37,169,39,125,34,204,246,195,127,72,88,63,72,251,220]},"name":"The.Boston.Strangler.1968.1080p.BluRay.x265.HEVC.EAC3-SARTRE","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
