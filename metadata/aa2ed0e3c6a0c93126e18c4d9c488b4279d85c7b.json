Mary McAuliffe traces a decade that saw seismic change on almost every front, from art and architecture to music, literature, fashion, entertainment, transportation, and, most notably, behavior. The epicenter of all this creativity, as well as of the era&apos;s good times, was Montparnasse, where impoverished artists and writers found colleagues and cafes, and tourists discovered the Paris of their dreams. Major figures on the Paris scene - such as Gertrude Stein, Jean Cocteau, Picasso, Stravinsky, Diaghilev, and Proust - continued to hold sway, while others now came to prominence - including Ernest Hemingway, Coco Chanel, Cole Porter, and Josephine Baker, as well as Andre Citro&#xEB;n, Le Corbusier, Man Ray, Sylvia Beach, James Joyce, and the irrepressible Kiki of Montparnasse.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-08-10T12:00:31.459Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa2ed0e3c6a0c93126e18c4d9c488b4279d85c7b","dn":"When Paris Sizzled_ The 1920s Paris of Hemingway, Chanel, Coctea","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"aa2ed0e3c6a0c93126e18c4d9c488b4279d85c7b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,46,208,227,198,160,201,49,38,225,140,77,156,72,139,66,121,216,92,123]},"name":"When Paris Sizzled_ The 1920s Paris of Hemingway, Chanel, Coctea","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
