How can you get people to stay focused executing your plans? Are you pursuing too many &quot;top&quot; priorities? How do you avoid irrational traps without getting bogged down by over-analysis?\r\n\r\nWhy Quitters Win reveals why Tasler&apos;s elegantly simple 3-part Strategic Behavior framework is already driving excellence for everyone from Fortune 500 executives and middle managers to busy moms, small business owners and church leaders. Decades of research in social science and business strategy, as well as Tasler&apos;s own findings from surveying the decisions of hundreds of thousands of working adults reveal that the most successful people, teams, and companies are not those with access to the widest variety of opportunities or the steadiest supply of creative ideas. Surprisingly, the opposite is true. Too many exciting opportunities, good ideas, and &quot;top&quot; priorities erode our focus, confuse our teams, and keep us swirling around a plateau of mediocrity.\r\n\r\nWhy Quitters Win addresses a profoundly important topic with a brilliantly simple approach that has the power to profoundly change your life one decision at a time.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-04-29T12:00:37.150Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:29f2b8ee8c19cbb5fe1b038639a1cb3600c8aa8a","dn":"Why Quitters Win by Nick Tasler EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"29f2b8ee8c19cbb5fe1b038639a1cb3600c8aa8a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,242,184,238,140,25,203,181,254,27,3,134,57,161,203,54,0,200,170,138]},"name":"Why Quitters Win by Nick Tasler EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
