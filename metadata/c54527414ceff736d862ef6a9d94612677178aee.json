They have achieved the mindset of removing restrictive labels and recognised that exactly what is required to &#x2018;be a pianist&#x2019; already exists within from the moment they first sat at a piano and pressed their first key to their first live performance of a Chopin Nocturne, Liszt &#xE9;tude, Beethoven Sonata or solo Jazz improvisation.\r\n\r\nWater, just like all observable nature, teaches so much about how to live, let alone simply how to play the piano. It has been, until now, an untapped source of teaching which can guide the ready individual along the most natural path possible to achieve anything that may be desired.\r\n\r\nPianism embodies the self and is an extension of it; You play what You think about. As thoughts change, so too does playing; as experiences are gained, so too does playing change.\r\n\r\nGenre: Non-Fiction &gt; Arts &amp; Photography","last_updated":"2018-09-28T13:44:47.960Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:c54527414ceff736d862ef6a9d94612677178aee","dn":"Water Pianism: The Guide by Daniel Bennett (.epub)(.azw3)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"c54527414ceff736d862ef6a9d94612677178aee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,69,39,65,76,239,247,54,216,98,239,106,157,148,97,38,119,23,138,238]},"name":"Water Pianism: The Guide by Daniel Bennett (.epub)(.azw3)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
