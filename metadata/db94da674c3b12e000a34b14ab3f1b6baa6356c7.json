Jon&apos;s innovative approach is unique, fun, and challenging. The book offers a well researched original take on the use of pentatonic scales in rock improvisation. Using his &quot;Warp Refraction Principle&quot;, which takes into account the major third tuning interval between the second and third strings, Jon presents a series of five vertical patterns applied in two-string increments throughout the fretboard. The philosophy behind this project is to present concepts and techniques as a thought process rather than simply providing a reference manual.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote from uploader\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nThere is a newer version of this book (2005) available:\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you like this e-book and want to support the author -- please buy a paper copy","last_updated":"2017-09-06T12:06:10.872Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:db94da674c3b12e000a34b14ab3f1b6baa6356c7","dn":"Jon Finn - Advanced Modern Rock Guitar Improvisation (pdf)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"db94da674c3b12e000a34b14ab3f1b6baa6356c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,148,218,103,76,59,18,224,0,163,75,20,171,63,27,107,170,99,86,199]},"name":"Jon Finn - Advanced Modern Rock Guitar Improvisation (pdf)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
