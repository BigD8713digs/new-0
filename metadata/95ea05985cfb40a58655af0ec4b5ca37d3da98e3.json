ONE THRONE. WELCOME TO THE EMPIRE OF SALT.\r\n\r\nThe city of Darien stands at the weary end of a golden age. Twelve families keep order with soldiers and artefacts, spies and memories, clinging to a peace that shifts and crumbles. The people of the city endure what they cannot change.\r\n\r\nHere, amongst old feuds, a plot is hatched to kill a king. It will summon strangers to the city - Elias Post, a hunter, Tellius, an old swordsman banished from his home, Arthur, a boy who cannot speak, Daw Threefold, a chancer and gambler, Vic Deeds, who feels no guilt - and Nancy, a girl whose talent might be the undoing of them all.\r\n\r\nTheir arrival inside the walls as the sun sets will set off a series of explosive events. Before the sun returns, five destinies will have been made - and lost - in Darien","last_updated":"2018-01-05T12:07:41.145Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:95ea05985cfb40a58655af0ec4b5ca37d3da98e3","dn":"Conn Iggulden - [Empire of Salt 01] - Darien (epub)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"95ea05985cfb40a58655af0ec4b5ca37d3da98e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,234,5,152,92,251,64,165,134,85,175,14,196,181,202,55,211,218,152,227]},"name":"Conn Iggulden - [Empire of Salt 01] - Darien (epub)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
