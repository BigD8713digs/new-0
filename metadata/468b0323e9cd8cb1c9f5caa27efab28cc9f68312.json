It is certainly \r\none of the greatest of all time movies ever made.\r\n\r\nThe idea of this movie is to portray the spirit of American &quot;intellectuals&quot;\r\nof the era of when communism was a force the world had yet to come to terms with.\r\nAlthough this interest was well intended  it must be kept in mind that communism\r\nis cruel to the human spirit and is no real answer to our concerns for the\r\nappropriate sharing of resources as each must be given according to his true needs - his needs for justice, fairness, and the recognition of his true worth relatively speaking, even amongst his own kinfolk, on the basis of true merit overall.\r\n\r\nWithout this, the human spirit starts to suffer and begins to wither away.\r\nThank goodness that this nightmare has come to an end, and more socially\r\nresponsible means must now be found for a better allocation of resources\r\namongst our own folks in a spirit of true Christianly kindness without losing\r\nsight of merit of individual contribution and worthiness in this respect.\r\n\r\nplease seed - thanks kindly\r\n\r\nMichael Rizzo Chessman\r\n(moviesbyrizzo)\r\n\r\nSubtitles here included are:   Arabic Danish Dutch English Finnish German Greek\r\nItalian Norwegian Romanian Russian Swedish and even Turkish - Most subs were \r\njust freshly ripped by us from the  bluray disc and spell checked using \r\nthe freely donation supported subtitles editor software from Denmark","last_updated":"2018-09-20T12:04:38.131Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:468b0323e9cd8cb1c9f5caa27efab28cc9f68312","dn":"Reds (1981) 1080p H.264 Multi 2CD 12GB (moviesbyrizzo) subs","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"468b0323e9cd8cb1c9f5caa27efab28cc9f68312","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,139,3,35,233,205,140,177,201,245,202,162,126,250,178,140,201,246,131,18]},"name":"Reds (1981) 1080p H.264 Multi 2CD 12GB (moviesbyrizzo) subs","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
