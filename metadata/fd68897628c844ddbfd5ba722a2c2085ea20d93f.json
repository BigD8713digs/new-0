Weaving together stunning specially shot performance footage, never-before-seen family super 8 home movies and MacMillan&apos;s own voice from the archives, alongside those who were closest to him, the documentary reveals MacMillan to have been a complex figure who lit up the ballet world with his bold choreographic genius while struggling privately with alcoholism, anxiety, and depression.\r\n\r\nPacked full of extraordinary ballet excerpts showcasing a wide range of MacMillan&apos;s work including Romeo and Juliet, Manon and Mayerling, the programme also offers a surprisingly moving and intimate portrait of a true giant of 20th-century culture. Featuring contributions from MacMillan&apos;s family, Darcey Bussell, Dame Monica Mason and Sir Anthony Dowell.\r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC High L3.1\r\n * Video Bitrate: CRF 19 (~2127Kbps)\r\n * Video Resolution: 1280x720\r\n * Frame Rate: 25 FPS\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC-LC\r\n * Audio Bitrate: Q=0.45 VBR 48KHz (~128Kbps)\r\n * Audio Channels: 2\r\n * Run-Time: 59 mins\r\n * Part Size: 951 MB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Subtitles: Merged","last_updated":"2018-05-07T12:06:29.272Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd68897628c844ddbfd5ba722a2c2085ea20d93f","dn":"BBC Ballets Dark Knight Sir Kenneth MacMillan 720p x264 AAC HDTV","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"fd68897628c844ddbfd5ba722a2c2085ea20d93f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,104,137,118,40,200,68,221,191,213,186,114,42,44,32,133,234,32,217,63]},"name":"BBC Ballets Dark Knight Sir Kenneth MacMillan 720p x264 AAC HDTV","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
