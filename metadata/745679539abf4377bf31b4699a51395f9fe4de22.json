He lives alone in a big house in Surrey, England, looked after by a chauffeur, butler, cook and housemaid. He has but one concern--his fortune in excess of 500 million and who should inherit it on his death. Past Imperfect is the story of a quest. Damian Baxter wishes to know if he has a living heir. By the time he married in his late 30s he was sterile (the result of adult mumps), but what about before that unfortunate illness? Had he sired a child? He sets himself (and others) to the task of finding his heir.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-10-30T12:02:21.208Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:745679539abf4377bf31b4699a51395f9fe4de22","dn":"Past Imperfect by Julian Fellowes EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"745679539abf4377bf31b4699a51395f9fe4de22","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,86,121,83,154,191,67,119,191,49,180,105,154,81,57,95,159,228,222,34]},"name":"Past Imperfect by Julian Fellowes EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
