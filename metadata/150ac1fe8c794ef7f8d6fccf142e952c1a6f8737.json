The Power of Noticing provides the blueprint for accomplishing precisely that. Max Bazerman, an expert in the field of applied behavioral psychology, draws on three decades of research and his experience instructing Harvard Business School MBAs and corporate executives to teach you how to notice and act on information that may not be immediately obvious.\r\n\r\nDrawing on a wealth of real-world examples, from the Challenger Space Shuttle disaster to Bernie Madoff&apos;s Ponzi scheme, Bazerman diagnoses what information went ignored in these situations, and why. Using many of the same case studies and thought experiments designed in his executive MBA classes, he challenges readers to explore their cognitive blind spots, identify any salient details they are programmed to miss, and then take steps to ensure it won&#x2019;t happen again. While many best-selling business books have explained how susceptible to manipulation our irrational cognitive blind spots make us, Bazerman helps you avoid the habits that lead to poor decisions and ineffective leadership in the first place. His book provides a step-by-step guide to breaking bad habits and spotting the hidden details that will change your decision-making and leadership skills for the better, teaching you to: pay attention to what didn&#x2019;t happen; acknowledge self-interest; invent the third choice; and realize that what you see is not all there is.\r\n\r\nWith The Power of Noticing at your side, you can learn how to notice what others miss, make better decisions, and lead more successfully.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-02-05T12:04:37.516Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:150ac1fe8c794ef7f8d6fccf142e952c1a6f8737","dn":"The Power of Noticing by Max Bazerman EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"150ac1fe8c794ef7f8d6fccf142e952c1a6f8737","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,10,193,254,140,121,78,247,248,214,252,207,20,46,149,44,26,111,135,55]},"name":"The Power of Noticing by Max Bazerman EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
