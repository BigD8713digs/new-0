Are the Turing Test, the ubiquitous CAPTCHAs, and the various animal cognition tests the best alternatives? In this fascinating and provocative book, Jos&#xE9; Hern&#xE1;ndez-Orallo formulates major scientific questions, integrates the most significant research developments, and offers a vision of the universal evaluation of cognition. By replacing the dominant anthropocentric stance with a universal perspective where living organisms are considered as a special case, long-standing questions in the evaluation of behavior can be addressed in a wider landscape. Can we derive task difficulty intrinsically? Is a universal g factor - a common general component for all abilities - theoretically possible? Using algorithmic information theory as a foundation, the book elaborates on the evaluation of perceptual, developmental, social, verbal and collective features and critically analyzes what the future of intelligence might look like.\r\nTable of Contents\r\n\r\nPart I A Long-Pondered Outfit\r\nChapter 1 Extended Nature\r\nChapter 2 Mind The Step: Scala Universalis\r\n\r\nPart II The Evaluation Discordance\r\nChapter 3 The Evaluation Of Human Behaviour\r\nChapter 4 The Evaluation Of Non-Human Natural Behaviour\r\nChapter 5 The Evaluation Of Artificial Intelligence\r\nChapter 6 The Boundaries Against A Unified Evaluation\r\n\r\nPart III The Algorithmic Confluence\r\nChapter 7 Intelligence And Algorithmic Information Theory\r\nChapter 8 Cognitive Tasks And Difficulty\r\nChapter 9 From Tasks To Tests\r\nChapter 10 The Arrangement Of Abilities\r\nChapter 11 General Intelligence\r\n\r\nPart IV The Society of Minds\r\nChapter 12 Cognitive Development And Potential\r\nChapter 13 Identifying Social Skills\r\nChapter 14 Communication Abilities\r\nChapter 15 Evaluating Collective And Hybrid Systems\r\n\r\nPart V The Kingdom of Ends\r\nChapter 16 Universal Tests\r\nChapter 17 Rooting For Ratiocentrism\r\nChapter 18 Exploitation And Exploration","last_updated":"2017-06-05T12:00:36.689Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:26b0fcd02e9215c9d695ba3ad372626a3e70b39c","dn":"The Measure of All Minds: Evaluating Natural and Artificial Inte","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"26b0fcd02e9215c9d695ba3ad372626a3e70b39c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,176,252,208,46,146,21,201,214,149,186,58,211,114,98,106,62,112,179,156]},"name":"The Measure of All Minds: Evaluating Natural and Artificial Inte","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
