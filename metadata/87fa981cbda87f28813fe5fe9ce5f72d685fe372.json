J. Vernon EPUB\r\n\r\nFor fans of S. J. Watson and A. S. A. Harrison comes a chilling look at marriage and madness from a talented new voice in psychological suspense.\r\n\r\nHer husband is missing.\r\n\r\nVisiting her family&apos;s South Carolina estate, socialite Gray Godfrey wakes from a night out to an empty bed. Her husband, Paul, is gone, and a thrashing hangover has wiped her memory clean. At first, she&apos;s relieved for the break from her tumultuous marriage; perhaps Paul just needed some space. But when his car is found abandoned on the highway, Gray must face the truth: Paul is gone. And Gray may not want him found. \r\n\r\nHer life is unraveling.\r\n\r\nWhen a stranger named Annie calls claiming to know Paul&apos;s whereabouts, Gray reluctantly accepts her help. But this ally is not what she seems: soon Annie is sending frightening messages and revealing disturbing secrets only Gray could know. As Annie&apos;s threats escalate and Gray&apos;s grip on reality begins to slip, the life she thought she had and the dark truth she&apos;s been living begin to merge, leaving an unsettling question: What does Annie want? And what will she do to get it?\r\n\r\nA chilling look at marriage, madness, and the lives we think we lead, When You Find Me is a daring debut from a talented new voice in psychological suspense.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-10-13T12:20:44.967Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:87fa981cbda87f28813fe5fe9ce5f72d685fe372","dn":"When You Find Me by P.
