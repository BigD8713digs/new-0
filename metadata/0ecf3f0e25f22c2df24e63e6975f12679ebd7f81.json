Dispatches from Pluto is their journey of discovery into this strange and wonderful American place.\r\n\r\nOn a remote, isolated strip of land, three miles beyond the tiny community of Pluto, Richard and his girlfriend, Mariah, embark on a new life. They learn to hunt, grow their own food, and fend off alligators, snakes, and varmints galore. They befriend an array of unforgettable local characters - blues legend T-Model Ford, cookbook maven Martha Foose, catfish farmers, eccentric millionaires, and the actor Morgan Freeman. Grant brings an adept, empathetic eye to the fascinating people he meets, capturing the rich, extraordinary culture of the Delta while tracking its utterly bizarre and criminal extremes.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-04-16T17:05:28.672Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ecf3f0e25f22c2df24e63e6975f12679ebd7f81","dn":"Dispatches from Pluto by Richard Grant EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"0ecf3f0e25f22c2df24e63e6975f12679ebd7f81","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,207,63,14,37,242,44,45,242,78,99,230,151,95,18,103,158,189,127,129]},"name":"Dispatches from Pluto by Richard Grant EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
