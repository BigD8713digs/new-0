It&#x2019;s everywhere: in the injuries that earned him a year-long medical leave; in the suffering of every victim he&#x2019;s ever encountered; in the agony of his past. But he must keep the pain at bay to prove he still has what it takes to do the job. So it&#x2019;s only fitting that his first major case back is a gruesome one: A California congressman&#x2019;s daughter-in-law and grandchildren have been brutally murdered, and the carnage is some of the worst Danny&#x2019;s ever seen. Is it a mob hit? Political retribution? A random sex crime?\r\n\r\nNothing quite adds up&#x2026;until Danny and his partner, Jennifer Tanaka, begin scratching at the surface of the congressman&#x2019;s picture-perfect family. Beneath the shiny, camera-ready veneer, Danny discovers a dark, twisted tale of suffering - even as the pain of his own past threatens to derail the investigation.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-07-21T12:00:41.524Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:8fe70d3dc92e181a0169960a963bd1d373e2a8fc","dn":"The Pain Scale (Long Beach Homicide series_book 2) by Tyler Dilt","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"8fe70d3dc92e181a0169960a963bd1d373e2a8fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,231,13,61,201,46,24,26,1,105,150,10,150,59,209,211,115,226,168,252]},"name":"The Pain Scale (Long Beach Homicide series_book 2) by Tyler Dilt","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
