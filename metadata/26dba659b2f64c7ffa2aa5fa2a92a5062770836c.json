The company&#x2019;s first post-sale version 14 in 2016 fixed many compatibility issues and bugs neglected by the prior owner.\r\n\r\nWith Vegas Pro 15, the software is once more competitive with other prosumer video editing suites. It adds numerous modern features that serious video editors expect. The result is one of the best semi-pro video editing applications for the price. You can read about other prosumer packages, plus consumer and even free programs, in our comprehensive roundup of video editing software.\r\n\r\nVegas offers a standard, timeline-based video editing interface, but you can also use the trim view to make selections in what would otherwise be the preview window. Import and export format support is excellent. The lineup of effects and transitions is pretty good, though we felt some of them could have been more elegantly executed.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs with other video editing software, there are lots of subtle features that new users might not pick up on right away. For example, we found scrubbing through the timeline to be a bit sluggish when we clicked the playhead, because it also scrubs through audio this way. Dragging the selection line instead limits the scrubbing to video. Fortunately, Vegas Pro 15 comes with serviceable interactive tutorials and a robust help database, so as pro editors go, it&#x2019;s pretty easy to pick up and learn.\r\n\r\n\r\nVegas Pro 15 has a fully customizable toolbar, so you can choose which features and settings to expose. This is always welcome, because creatives often work best without clutter.\r\n\r\nIt also lets you get very deep into customizing many aspects of how it runs. For example, you can specify a maximum number of rendering threads. Nuances like this will be intimidating to some users, but experienced professionals will love it.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n\r\n1 - Intall Magix Vegas\r\n\r\n2 - Replace file Protein_x64.3.17.dll located at C:Program FilesVEGASVEGAS Pro 15.0Protein with R2R API Level Emulator.\r\n\r\n(You can change the registration name by add registry value, just edit the 1.reg file and enter your name, dont change the serial number in the .reg file, after the edit is done just double click in it)\r\n\r\n3 - Install the HitFilm_Movie_Essentials_Pack and the NewBlueFilters5Ultimate\r\n\r\nthat&apos;s all!\r\n\r\nEnJoy!!!","last_updated":"2018-07-17T12:03:50.032Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:26dba659b2f64c7ffa2aa5fa2a92a5062770836c","dn":"MAGIX VEGAS Pro v.15.0.0.384 Cracked [deepstatus]","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"26dba659b2f64c7ffa2aa5fa2a92a5062770836c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,219,166,89,178,246,76,127,250,42,165,250,42,146,165,6,39,112,131,108]},"name":"MAGIX VEGAS Pro v.15.0.0.384 Cracked [deepstatus]","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
