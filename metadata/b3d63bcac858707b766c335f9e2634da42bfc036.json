It has become a staple of movies and television shows as diverse as Shrek and The West Wing, of tribute videos and telethons. It has been covered by hundreds of artists, including Bob Dylan, U2, Justin Timberlake, and k.d. lang, and it is played every year at countless events - both sacred and secular - around the world.\r\n\r\nYet when music legend Leonard Cohen first wrote and recorded &quot;Hallelujah&quot;, it was for an album rejected by his longtime record label.

Three years after that, Buckley would be dead, his album largely unknown, and &quot;Hallelujah&quot; still unreleased as a single.
