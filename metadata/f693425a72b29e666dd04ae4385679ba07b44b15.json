From the boys&apos; humble beginnings in Liverpool, to the cellars of Hamburg, When They Were Boys includes stories never before told, including heartbreaks, lucky breaks, and dramatic twists of timing, fate, loyalty, and betrayal. Included are an eyewitness account of that first meeting between Lennon and McCartney, the inside story of how Ringo replaced Pete Best, an exploration of the brilliant but troubled soul of manager Brian Epstein, the real scoop on their disastrous first visit to Germany, and the death of Stu Sutcliffe. With an eye for life in Liverpool during the 50s and 60s, and with the help of his own conversations with the Beatles in the early years, Larry Kane brings to life the evolution of the group that changed music forever.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-03-15T12:00:30.340Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:f693425a72b29e666dd04ae4385679ba07b44b15","dn":"When They Were Boys by Larry Kane EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"f693425a72b29e666dd04ae4385679ba07b44b15","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,147,66,90,114,178,158,102,109,208,74,228,56,86,121,186,7,180,75,21]},"name":"When They Were Boys by Larry Kane EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
