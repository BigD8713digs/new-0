Decker, star tenant of the local trailer park and neophyte private eye is fishing for a killer.\r\n\r\nThanks to a sportsman&apos;s scam that&apos;s anything but sportsmanlike, there&apos;s a body floating in Coon Bog, Florida -- and a lot that&apos;s rotten in the murky waters of big-stakes, large-mouth bass tournaments.\r\n\r\nHere Decker will team up with a half-blind, half-mad hermit with an appetite for road kill; dare to kiss his ex-wife while she&apos;s in bed with her new husband; and face deadly TV evangelists, dangerously seductive women, and a pistol-toting redneck with a pit bull on his arm.\r\n\r\nAnd here his own life becomes part of the stakes. For while the &quot;double whammy&quot; is the lure, first prize is for the most ingenious murder","last_updated":"2017-12-16T12:04:12.064Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:e22060f02d3b08b4c5873abce205fceec81cfe9c","dn":"Double Whammy - Carl Hiaasen","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"e22060f02d3b08b4c5873abce205fceec81cfe9c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,32,96,240,45,59,8,180,197,135,58,188,226,5,252,238,200,28,254,156]},"name":"Double Whammy - Carl Hiaasen","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
