What starts as an insignificant little niggle, gently hinting at a kind of food, grows into a demanding craving. The kind that drags you out of bed in the middle of the night on a search for cheese, or causes you to break away from your desk in a desperate hunt for chocolate.\r\n\r\nCrave is the second book from Sunday Times bestselling author and Great British Bake Off contestant, Martha Collison. Using brilliant food science and delicious flavour combinations, she provides go-to recipes incorporating 8 of those things we so often hanker for: citrus, fruit, nut, spice, chocolate, caramel, cheese &#x2013; and alcohol! There are &#x2018;Instant&#x2019; recipes such as Lemon Cheesecake Pots &#x2013; your super quick treats to be rustled up in next to no time. There are &#x2018;Soon&#x2019; recipes that are ready to snaffle in under an hour, like Chilli Chocolate Churros. And you&#x2019;ll find &#x2018;Worth the Wait&#x2019; recipes, too.
