Sound familiar? You&#x2019;re not alone!Good news is, unit testing can make this a thing of the past.Maybe you&#x2019;ve heard of automated or unit testing before and you&#x2019;re keen to learn more.Or perhaps you&#x2019;ve tried to learn it and got a bit lost or ended up with fat and fragile tests that got in the way and slowed you down.Either way, what you need is a course that will teach you all you need to know about this essential skill &#x2013; from the basics, right through to mastery level.\r\nWhat is unit testing?\r\nIn a nutshell: it&#x2019;s the practice of writing code to test your code and then run those tests in an automated fashion.\r\n\r\nWhy learn unit testing?\r\nWhy write extra code? Wouldn&#x2019;t that take extra time to write? Would that slow you down? Why not just run the application and test it like an end user?\r\nThinking like this is the mistake lots of people make. I used to make it myself. I&#x2019;ve had to learn the hard way!\r\n\r\nWho is the target audience?\r\n\r\n    Anyone who wants to build better quality software with fewer bugs\r\n    Any developers who want to transition to the senior level\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n\r\n    Minimum 3 months programming in C#","last_updated":"2018-07-12T12:06:20.189Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:496ac8a8d3c16b88895d8764b7a8cd5db4d21389","dn":"Udemy - Unit Testing for C# Developers","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"496ac8a8d3c16b88895d8764b7a8cd5db4d21389","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,106,200,168,211,193,107,136,137,93,135,100,183,168,205,93,180,210,19,137]},"name":"Udemy - Unit Testing for C# Developers","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
