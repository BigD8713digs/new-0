Arguably, no literary work is more familiar to us. Everyone knows at least six words fromHamlet, and most people know many more. Yet the play&#x97;Shakespeare&#x92;s longest&#x97;is more than &#x93;passing strange,&#x94; and it becomes even more complex when considered closely.\r\n\r\nReading Hamlet alongside other writers, philosophers, and psychoanalysts&#x97;Carl Schmitt, Walter Benjamin, Freud, Lacan, Nietzsche, Melville, and Joyce&#x97;Simon Critchley and Jamieson Webster go in search of a particularly modern drama that is as much about ourselves as it is a product of Shakespeare&#x92;s imagination. They also offer a startling interpretation of the action onstage: it is structured around &#x93;nothing&#x94;&#x97;or, in the enigmatic words of the player queen, &#x93;it nothing must.&#x94;\r\n\r\nFrom the illusion of theater and the spectacle of statecraft to the psychological interplay of inhibition and emotion,Hamlet discloses the modern paradox of our lives: how thought and action seem to pull against each other, the one annulling the possibility of the other. As a counterweight to Hamlet&#x92;s melancholy paralysis, Ophelia emerges as the play&#x92;s true hero. In her madness, she lives the love of which Hamlet is incapable.\r\n\r\nAvoiding the customary clich&#xE9;s about the timelessness of the Bard, Critchley and Webster show the timely power ofHamlet to cast light on the intractable dilemmas of human existence in a world that is rotten and out of joint.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  <a href=\"\nhttps://pirates-forum.org/Forum-Requests\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://pirates-forum.org/Forum-Requests</a>","last_updated":"2018-06-03T12:07:50.039Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b24ffa9b1665b045783dd849b69a1fa71e9a95b","dn":"Simon Critchley - Stay, Illusion: The Hamlet Doctrine (epub)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"2b24ffa9b1665b045783dd849b69a1fa71e9a95b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,36,255,169,177,102,91,4,87,131,221,132,155,105,161,250,113,233,169,91]},"name":"Simon Critchley - Stay, Illusion: The Hamlet Doctrine (epub)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
