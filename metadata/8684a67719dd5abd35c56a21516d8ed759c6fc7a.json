But what does it really mean to be good?\r\n\r\nLeaders love to say that any company is only as good as its people but tend to evaluate candidates and employees more by their measurable accomplishments than by their &quot;softer&quot; qualities, like integrity, compassion, and other values. Best-selling author Anthony Tjan is leading a movement to change the way we think about goodness so that we can become better judges of people and create more goodness in ourselves, in others, and in our organizations.\r\n\r\nTjan argues that while competence is necessary, real goodness must also encompass values; a fantastic r&#xE9;sum&#xE9; can never compensate for mediocre character. In Good People, he provides a clear language to discuss goodness, redefining it as a lifelong, proactive commitment that, like any skill, can be exercised, honed, and taught. When leaders prioritize goodness in themselves and in others, they can create lasting cultures and tremendous value.\r\n\r\nDrawing from his own experiences as an entrepreneur and venture capitalist, Tjan also taps in to the wisdom of his relationships and interviews with extraordinary innovators, executives, artists, academics, teachers, and role models from all disciplines and walks of life.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-07-05T12:01:22.917Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:8684a67719dd5abd35c56a21516d8ed759c6fc7a","dn":"Anthony Tjan - Good People 2017 RETAiL ePUB eBOOK-DiSTRiBUTiON","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"8684a67719dd5abd35c56a21516d8ed759c6fc7a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,132,166,119,25,221,90,189,53,197,106,33,81,109,142,215,89,198,252,122]},"name":"Anthony Tjan - Good People 2017 RETAiL ePUB eBOOK-DiSTRiBUTiON","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
