Stephen and Lily are happily married and ready to start a family. All of them are facing their own struggles, and all are finding their way through the dark. When they are brought together for a rather unconventional church Nativity, they will learn that with strength, courage, and love, there is always hope.\r\n\r\nThe New York Times bestselling author of the beloved The Christmas Hope series returns with this new heartwarming, inspirational story about the power of love and faith to reveal the possibilities that lay right in front of you","last_updated":"2017-05-29T13:14:54.589Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9fd77a6b0f96e6086a4d0dad534f88b380c195f","dn":"Donna VanLiere-The Christmas Light","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"f9fd77a6b0f96e6086a4d0dad534f88b380c195f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,253,119,166,176,249,110,96,134,164,208,218,213,52,248,139,56,12,25,95]},"name":"Donna VanLiere-The Christmas Light","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
