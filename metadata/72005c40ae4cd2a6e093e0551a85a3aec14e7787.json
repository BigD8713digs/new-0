And it&apos;s happening in Iraq.\r\nConsidered to be the original Garden of Eden, the marshes were once Iraq&apos;s wildlife jewel, where man and nature thrived for 5,000 years. But in the 1990s, Saddam Hussein drained these gigantic wetlands and turned them into a desert, destroying a home to thousands of people and millions of birds.\r\n\r\nDonning his body armour, film-maker David Johnson travels to the Mesopotamian marshes to follow the work of Azzam Alwash, the visionary Iraqi engineer at the centre of this extraordinary scheme to reflood hundreds of miles of desert and bring back life to the sands. This is a view of Iraq the world never sees, a world of huge reed beds and vast flocks of birds that fill the sky.\r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n * Video Codec: x265/HEVC CABAC Main10 L4\r\n * Video Bitrate: CRF 23 (~2537Kbps)\r\n * Video Resolution: 1920x1080\r\n * Frame Rate: 25 FPS\r\n * Audio Codec: HE-AAC\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160Kbps CBR 24KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: 6\r\n * Run-Time: 59 mins\r\n * Part Size: 1.11 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Subtitles: Merged","last_updated":"2018-09-20T12:22:08.417Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:72005c40ae4cd2a6e093e0551a85a3aec14e7787","dn":"BBC Natural World 2011 Miracle in the Marshes of Iraq 1080p x265","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"72005c40ae4cd2a6e093e0551a85a3aec14e7787","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,0,92,64,174,76,210,166,224,147,224,85,26,133,163,174,193,78,119,135]},"name":"BBC Natural World 2011 Miracle in the Marshes of Iraq 1080p x265","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
