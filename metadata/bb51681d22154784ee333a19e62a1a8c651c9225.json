Presented in a brand-new transfer from the original film elements in its original theatrical aspect ratio, Love Thy Neighbour features Jack Smethurst, Rudolph Walker, Nina Baden-Semper and Kate Williams reprising their starring roles alongside appearances by comedy veterans Patricia Hayes and Army Game legend Bill Fraser.\r\n\r\nUnbeknown to their warring husbands, neighbours and close pals Joan Booth and Barbie Reynolds enter a &quot;Love Thy Neighbour&quot; competition to win a holiday cruise. Already fearing the consequences, the wives find neighbourly relations further strained when each couple has relatives to stay &#x2013; prompting them to wonder what&apos;ll happen when Bill and Eddie find their parents actually get on..!","last_updated":"2017-09-22T12:07:48.535Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb51681d22154784ee333a19e62a1a8c651c9225","dn":"Love Thy Neighbour 1973 Jack Smethurst Rudolph Walker.mp4","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"bb51681d22154784ee333a19e62a1a8c651c9225","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,81,104,29,34,21,71,132,238,51,58,25,230,42,26,140,101,28,146,37]},"name":"Love Thy Neighbour 1973 Jack Smethurst Rudolph Walker.mp4","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
