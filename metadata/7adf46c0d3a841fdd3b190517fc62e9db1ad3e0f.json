This may seem hard to accept, but as Harari explains in his trademark style - thorough yet riveting - famine, plague, and war have been transformed from incomprehensible and uncontrollable forces of nature into manageable challenges. For the first time ever, more people die from eating too much than from eating too little; more people die from old age than from infectious diseases; and more people commit suicide than are killed by soldiers, terrorists, and criminals put together. The average American is 1,000 times more likely to die from binging at McDonalds than from being blown up by Al Qaeda.\r\n\r\nWhat then will replace famine, plague, and war at the top of the human agenda? As the self-made gods of planet Earth, what destinies will we set ourselves, and which quests will we undertake? Homo Deus explores the projects, dreams, and nightmares that will shape the 21st century - from overcoming death to creating artificial life. It asks the fundamental questions: Where do we go from here? And how will we protect this fragile world from our own destructive powers? This is the next stage of evolution. This is Homo Deus.\r\n\r\nWith the same insight and clarity that made Sapiens an international hit and a New York Times best seller, Harari maps out our future","last_updated":"2017-05-24T11:19:24.411Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:7adf46c0d3a841fdd3b190517fc62e9db1ad3e0f","dn":"Yuval Noah Harari - Homo Deus 2016 RETAiL ePUB eBOOK-DiSTRiBUTiO","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"7adf46c0d3a841fdd3b190517fc62e9db1ad3e0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,223,70,192,211,168,65,253,211,177,144,81,127,198,46,157,177,173,62,15]},"name":"Yuval Noah Harari - Homo Deus 2016 RETAiL ePUB eBOOK-DiSTRiBUTiO","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
