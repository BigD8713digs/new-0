Yet even though children with dyslexia may have trouble reading, they don&apos;t have any problems learning; dyslexia has nothing to do with a lack of intellect.\r\n\r\nWhile other books tell you what dyslexia is, this book tells you what to do. Dyslexics&apos; innate skills, which may include verbal, social, spatial, kinesthetic, visual, mathematical, or musical abilities, are their unique key to acquiring knowledge. Figuring out where their individual strengths lie, and then harnessing these skills, offers an entr&#xE9;e into learning and excelling. And by keeping the focus on learning, not on standard reading the same way everyone else does, a child with dyslexia can and will develop the self-confidence to flourish in the classroom and beyond.\r\n\r\nAfter years of battling with a school system that did not understand his dyslexia and the shame that accompanied it, renowned activist and entrepreneur Ben Foss is not only open about his dyslexia, he is proud of it. In The Dyslexia Empowerment Plan he shares his personal triumphs and failures so that you can learn from his experiences, and provides a three-step approach for success:\r\n\r\nIdentify your child&apos;s profile\r\nHelp your child help himself\r\nCreate community\r\n\r\nPacked with practical ideas and strategies dyslexic children need for excelling in school and in life, this empowering guide provides the framework for charting a future for your child that is bright with hope and unlimited potential.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-07-25T12:00:28.740Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:4817ee52b756c3f217e464ddb7d07d4dfe25ff6e","dn":"The Dyslexia Empowerment Plan_ A Blueprint for Renewing Your Chi","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"4817ee52b756c3f217e464ddb7d07d4dfe25ff6e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,23,238,82,183,86,195,242,23,228,100,221,183,208,125,77,254,37,255,110]},"name":"The Dyslexia Empowerment Plan_ A Blueprint for Renewing Your Chi","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
