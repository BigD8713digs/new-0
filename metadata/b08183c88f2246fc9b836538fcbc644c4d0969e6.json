The Naked City is actually about six days in the life of New York City that coincide with the murder and the subsequent investigation by Lt. Dan Muldoon (Barry Fitzgerald) and Detective James Halloran (Don Taylor). The account of their work, and the workings of the New York City police department, is interspersed with brief vignettes about the life of the city around them, and, especially, the reaction of residents to the murder and the newspaper reports of the progress of the case. Their investigation carries them into the highest and lowest ends of New York&apos;s social strata to find the killer. The final chase on the Williamsburg Bridge is one of the classic pieces of suspense cinema, as the armed and desperate killer races up the walkway, while detectives close in on foot from behind and patrol cars come up from ahead, and then into the superstructure of the bridge for a stand-off and shootout. Producer/narrator Mark Hellinger,  intoned the closing monologue, which opens with one of the most famous tag lines in movie history: &quot;There are eight million stories in the Naked City.&quot;\r\n\r\nSTARS.........: Barry Fitzgerald, Howard Duff, Dorothy Hart\r\nDIRECTOR......: Jules Dassin\r\nWRITERS.......: Albert Maltz, Malvin Wald \r\nGENRE.........: Crime, Drama, Film-Noir\r\nTOMATOMETER...: 86\r\nIMDB RATING...: 7.6/10  10,053 votes\r\nIMDB LINK.....: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0040636\r\nRUNTIME.......: 1h 36mn\r\nSIZE..........: 4.88 GB\r\nVIDEO CODEC...: HEVC (Main@L4)\r\nBITRATE.......: 7000 Kbps (2-pass)\r\nRESOLUTION....: 1920x1080\r\nASPECT RATIO..: 1.37:1\r\nFRAMERATE.....: 23.976 fps\r\nAUDIO1........: English AAC 1.0 192kbps CVBR\r\nAUDIO2........: Commentary by writer Malvin Wald\r\nSUBTITLES.....: ENG\r\nCHAPTERS......: Yes\r\nSOURCE........: Arrow Blu Ray\r\nENCODED BY....: Sartre\r\nENCODE DATE...: 2018-06-21\r\n\r\n\r\nExtras\r\n\r\n&#x2022; Stills Gallery\r\n&#x2022; New York and The Naked City\r\n&#x2022; The Hollywood Ten\r\n&#x2022; Jules Dassin at LACMA\r\n&#x2022; Audio Commentary\r\n&#x2022; Theatrical Trailer","last_updated":"2018-06-28T12:14:26.737Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:b08183c88f2246fc9b836538fcbc644c4d0969e6","dn":"The.Naked.City.1948.1080p.BluRay.x265.HEVC.AAC-SARTRE","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"b08183c88f2246fc9b836538fcbc644c4d0969e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,129,131,200,143,34,70,252,155,131,101,56,252,188,100,76,77,9,105,230]},"name":"The.Naked.City.1948.1080p.BluRay.x265.HEVC.AAC-SARTRE","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
