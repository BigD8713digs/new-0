But, at 48 years old, having spent decades in San Francisco, he craved change.\r\n\r\nGrieving over the death of his partner, he quickly discovered the profound consolations of the city&apos;s incessant rhythms, the sight of the Empire State Building against the night sky, and New Yorkers themselves, kindred souls that Hayes, a lifelong insomniac, encountered on late-night strolls with his camera.\r\n\r\nAnd he unexpectedly fell in love again, with his friend and neighbor, the writer and neurologist Oliver Sacks, whose exuberance - &apos;I don&apos;t so much fear death as I do wasting life,&apos; he tells Hayes early on - is captured in funny and touching vignettes throughout. What emerges is a portrait of Sacks at his most personal and endearing, from falling in love for the first time at age 75 to facing illness and death (Sacks died of cancer in August 2015).\r\n\r\nInsomniac City is both a meditation on grief and a celebration of life, a love song to the New York City and to all who have felt the particular magic and solace it offers","last_updated":"2017-05-24T11:19:55.388Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9dd9e220c73eeaff91c9087cc002fd6691f6761","dn":"Bill Hayes - Insomniac City 2017 RETAiL ePUB eBOOK-DiSTRiBUTiON","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"a9dd9e220c73eeaff91c9087cc002fd6691f6761","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,221,158,34,12,115,238,175,249,28,144,135,204,0,47,214,105,31,103,97]},"name":"Bill Hayes - Insomniac City 2017 RETAiL ePUB eBOOK-DiSTRiBUTiON","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
