Have you previously tried to learn Django but got fed up with incomplete YouTube videos and poorly written tutorials? Or are you looking to move your code from Django 1 to Django 2?\r\nTHEN THIS IS THE COURSE FOR YOU!\r\nIn my Django course, I will walk you through the Django web framework from beginning to end! I&#x2019;m a self-taught programmer so I know what it feels like to start from scratch. I care about your learning, but even more importantly&#x2026; I care about you!\r\n\r\nWhat is Django?\r\nDjango is an open-source web framework that is written in Python. It was created about twelve years ago, but in December 2017 Django 2 was released with a whole new set of features and capabilities!\r\nDjango is an amazing framework for web developers because it provides the infrastructure required for database-driven websites that have user authentication, content administration, contact forms, file uploads, and more. Instead of creating all of these features from scratch, you can use the Django framework and utilize these components that are already built, and focus your time on developing your web app instead.\r\nWho is the target audience?\r\n\r\n    Anyone looking for a great beginner&#x2019;s guide to Django\r\n    Python developers that want to learn web development with Django\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n    You will need a computer and an interest in learning Django!\r\n    Some experience with coding in any language is a plus, but not required","last_updated":"2018-05-07T12:10:00.548Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:e7c3d4c4833827715d0af047e134df00378e7c30","dn":"Django 2 &amp; Python | The Ultimate Web Development Bootcamp","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"e7c3d4c4833827715d0af047e134df00378e7c30","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,195,212,196,131,56,39,113,93,10,240,71,225,52,223,0,55,142,124,48]},"name":"Django 2 &amp; Python | The Ultimate Web Development Bootcamp","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
