Coupled with his robust, tasteful songwriting, the effect is to pull the listener into a song or album, grabbing at the brain -- not just the ears. \r\nAuberge is the follow-up to Road to Hell, an ambitious, dark-toned album that found European and critical success. Auberge may not be as dark as its predecessor, but Rea seemingly can&apos;t sing a word without sharpening its flinty edges, making it a bit threatening. That said, his latest effort tempers that wariness with a mixture of cavalier spontaneity and sighing recall. It&apos;s the thoughts and feelings of a man on a meandering road trip, thinking over the things he&apos;s said and done. \r\n&quot;Heaven&quot; seems to recall a time when the afterlife was in reach, but it could just as easily be the song of someone who&apos;s finally found his way. The reggae-tinged &quot;Every Second Counts&quot; finds Rea adjusting his phrasing perfectly to the song&apos;s mellow upbeat, while the rousing title track and its accompanying set piece &quot;Set Me Free&quot; move from searching, tentative guitar noodlings into full-blown epics, sketching the album&apos;s story line with bluesy bottom end, blustering horns, backup singers, and Rea&apos;s own grainy vocal rumble. \r\nAuberge might be a bit tough to break into at first, like a road map that you just can&apos;t unfold, but that&apos;s because ambitious, rangy songwriting is going to take a few odd turns on its way to the scenic overlook where everything becomes clear. In Rea&apos;s case, that moment is summed up over the twisting guitar and swelling strings of &quot;Gone Fishing.&quot; &quot;You can waste a whole lifetime trying to be what you think is expected of you,&quot; he sings, and offers the simple act of casting a line as cure for life&apos;s wrong turns.
