The superpower was Persia, incomparably rich in ambition, gold, and men. The terrorist states were Athens and Sparta, eccentric cities in a poor and mountainous backwater: Greece. The story of how their citizens took on the Great King of Persia, and thereby saved not only themselves, but Western civilization as well, is as heart-stopping and fateful as any episode in history. Tom Holland&apos;s brilliant study of these critical Persian Wars skillfully examines a conflict of critical importance to both ancient and modern history.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-09-04T12:00:34.675Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:74725f6e861d79a0ea92a10872bca81994ac5c35","dn":"Persian Fire_ The First World Empire and the Battle for the West","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"74725f6e861d79a0ea92a10872bca81994ac5c35","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,114,95,110,134,29,121,160,234,146,161,8,114,188,168,25,148,172,92,53]},"name":"Persian Fire_ The First World Empire and the Battle for the West","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
