Churchill is Prime Minister for the last time. Rationing is still in force. All music sounds like the BBC Radiophonic Workshop. People like living in 1952: it&apos;s familiar and reassuring, and Britain knows its place in the world. \r\n\r\nFew have noticed it&apos;s been 1952 for the past 65 years.\r\n\r\nMeet Professor Quanderhorn; a brilliant, maverick scientific genius who has absolutely no moral compass. With his Dangerous Giant Space Laser, High Rise Farm, Invisible Robot and Fleet of Monkey-driven Lorries, he&apos;s not afraid to push the boundaries of science to their very limit. \r\n\r\nEven when it&apos;s clearly insane to keep pushing. \r\n\r\nDespite the fact he&apos;s saved the world from several Martian invasions, the attacks of the Mole People, the Troglodyte Shape-shifters and the Beatniks from Under the Sea, plus countless other sinister phenomena which threatened to rend the very fabric of reality, the government would like to close him down. Why? Because they&apos;re terrified of him. Of his reality-warping experiments, of the mysterious button on his desk which he&apos;s constantly threatening to press. Of the unearthly secret locked in his cellar. And yet they&apos;re even more terrified it might stop being 1952 and they&apos;ll be out of power.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-08-29T12:03:27.880Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:a680828482f2605ea4dff646bec3f234f0620ccc","dn":"The Quanderhorn Xperimentations by R.
