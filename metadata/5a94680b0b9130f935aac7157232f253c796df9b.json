Each topic is introduced with an attractive physical problem, where a mathematical model is constructed using physical and constitutive laws arising from the conservation of mass, conservation of momentum, or Maxwell&#x2019;s electrodynamics.\r\nRelevant mathematical analysis (which might employ vector calculus, Fourier series, nonlinear ODEs, bifurcation theory, perturbation theory, potential theory, control theory, or probability theory) or scientific computing (which might include Newton&#x2019;s method, the method of lines, finite differences, finite elements, finite volumes, boundary elements, projection methods, smoothed particle hydrodynamics, or Lagrangian methods) is developed in context and used to make physically significant predictions. The target audience is advanced undergraduates (who have at least a working knowledge of vector calculus and linear ordinary differential equations) or beginning graduate students.\r\n\r\nReaders will gain a solid and exciting introduction to modeling, mathematical analysis, and computation that provides the key ideas and skills needed to enter the wider world of modern applied mathematics.\r\n- Presents an integrated wealth of modeling, analysis, and numerical methods in one volume\r\n- Provides practical and comprehensible introductions to complex subjects, for example, conservation laws, CFD, SPH, BEM, and FEM\r\n- Includes a rich set of applications, with more appealing problems and projects suggested\r\n\r\nAbout the Author\r\nCarmen Chicone, Professor of Mathematics, University of Missouri, has been teaching the material presented in this book for more than 10 years. He has extensive experience, and his enthusiasm for the subject is infectious.\r\n <a href=\"\nhttps://s26.postimg.org/esk15rftl/An_Invitation_to_Applied_Mathematics_-_Different.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://s26.postimg.org/esk15rftl/An_Invitation_to_Applied_Mathematics_-_Different.jpg</a>","last_updated":"2017-09-22T12:08:55.902Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a94680b0b9130f935aac7157232f253c796df9b","dn":"An Invitation to Applied Mathematics (gnv64)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"5a94680b0b9130f935aac7157232f253c796df9b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,148,104,11,11,145,48,249,53,170,199,21,114,50,242,83,199,150,223,155]},"name":"An Invitation to Applied Mathematics (gnv64)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
