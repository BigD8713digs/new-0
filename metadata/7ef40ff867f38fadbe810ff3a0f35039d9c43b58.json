Despite the abundance of unsolicited advice he gets to &quot;join the cops&quot; and &quot;stick to his own kind&quot;, Frank knows that he should educate himself and somehow rise above his circumstances.\r\n\r\nAnd though he left school at 14, he talks his way into New York University, falls in love with the quintessential Yankee, long-legged and blond, and tries to live his dream. But it is not until he starts to teach - and to write - that Frank finds his place in the world. And for those of us who are lucky enough to come across his writings - and captivating readings - &apos;Tis a wonderful thing that he did.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-01-31T12:00:49.312Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ef40ff867f38fadbe810ff3a0f35039d9c43b58","dn":"'Tis by Frank McCourt EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"7ef40ff867f38fadbe810ff3a0f35039d9c43b58","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,244,15,248,103,243,143,173,190,129,15,243,160,243,80,57,217,196,59,88]},"name":"'Tis by Frank McCourt EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
