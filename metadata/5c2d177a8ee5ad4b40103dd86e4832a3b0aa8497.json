Recorded live at the Lochem Festival in the Netherlands on May 20th, 1982 and preserved for posterity by the venerable Netherlands radio network VPRO \r\nThis is a significant Clash concert. It marks the very final appearance of founding member, Drummer Topper Headon, and the reappearance of Joe Strummer, who had mysteriously dropped out of sight a while earlier.\r\n\r\nIt was also an important appearance because it coincided with the release of their-then latest album Combat Rock. Even though only three songs from the new album are performed, it was still an important gig for the band, as it was around this time things were starting to fall apart.\r\n\r\nTracklist\r\n\r\n01.London Calling\r\n02.Safe European Home\r\n03.The Guns of Brixton\r\n04.Train in Vain\r\n05.Clash City Rockers\r\n06.Know Your Rights\r\n07.The Magnificent Seven\r\n08.Ghetto Defendant\r\n09.Should I Stay or Should I Go\r\n10.Police and Thieves\r\n11.Brand New Cadillac\r\n12.Bankrobber\r\n13.Complete Control\r\n14.Career Opportunities\r\n15.Clampdown\r\n\r\nClassic line-up (1977&#x2013;1982)\r\nJoe Strummer &#x2013; vocals, rhythm guitar (1976&#x2013;1986; died 2002)\r\nMick Jones &#x2013; lead guitar, vocals (1976&#x2013;1983)\r\nPaul Simonon &#x2013; bass, backing vocals (1976&#x2013;1986)\r\nNicky &quot;Topper&quot; Headon &#x2013; drums, percussion (1977&#x2013;1982)","last_updated":"2018-07-01T12:05:09.158Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c2d177a8ee5ad4b40103dd86e4832a3b0aa8497","dn":"The Clash - LIVE  Lochem  NL 1982 ak320","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"5c2d177a8ee5ad4b40103dd86e4832a3b0aa8497","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,45,23,122,142,229,173,75,64,16,61,216,110,72,50,163,176,170,132,151]},"name":"The Clash - LIVE  Lochem  NL 1982 ak320","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
