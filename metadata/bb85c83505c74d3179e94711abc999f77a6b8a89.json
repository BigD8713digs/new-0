Like the feline-sampling Brooklyn bros, the bicoastal duo emerged a little more than a decade ago, offering the allure of an oddball instrumental configuration &#x2014; a baritone guitarist with a sharp melodic sensibility and a crucial producer with a knack for situating that sound in some deeply absorbing context. But where Ratatat favored samples and beats and athletic themes, the Fun Years instead sprawled, sculpting soundtracks for the gloaming and for daybreak, or music to be played between Ratatat&#x2019;s up-all-night anthems. Isaac Sparks used turntables to create haunted landscapes populated by soft drones, disembodied voices, and textural phantoms, overlaid by Ben Recht&#x2019;s circular guitar lines, which always suggested some deep, unspoken longing. The Fun Years were a salve for when the lights weren&#x2019;t quite out, but the party was inarguably over. \r\nThe engrossing new Heroes of the Second Story Walk-Up at long last perfects that premise and promise. It is the most fully formed and expressive of the Fun Years&#x2019; ten albums to date and an immersive emotional Rorschach test, where each moment scans differently depending on what you bring to it. A forty-five-minute suite of seven interwoven pieces, Walk-Up moves like a long piano sonata, where each movement seems to comment on the same subject but never in quite the same way. The approach enables an emotional breadth and accessibility that can be rare in these arcane corners of instrumental music, making Walk-Up the kind of record you want to crawl into and inhabit for a spell. \r\n\r\nTracklist: \r\n01 - Tape Screen Triangles.flac \r\n02 - Ask For The Omega Man.flac \r\n03 - The Delusion Always Wins.flac \r\n04 - Radiator.flac \r\n05 - Deepest Xylophone.flac \r\n06 - A Decade Of Weakness pt I.flac \r\n07 - A Decade Of Weakness pt II.flac \r\n\r\nSummary: \r\nCountry: USA \r\nGenre: ambient, post-rock","last_updated":"2018-06-07T12:12:32.547Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb85c83505c74d3179e94711abc999f77a6b8a89","dn":"[ambient, post-rock] (2017) The Fun Years - Heroes of the Second","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"bb85c83505c74d3179e94711abc999f77a6b8a89","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,133,200,53,5,199,77,49,121,233,71,17,171,201,153,247,122,107,138,137]},"name":"[ambient, post-rock] (2017) The Fun Years - Heroes of the Second","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
