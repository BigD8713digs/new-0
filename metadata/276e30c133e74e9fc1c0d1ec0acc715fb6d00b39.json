Over the past twenty years or so, as trumpeter and saxophonist respectively, the West Canadian sisters have each shaped prolific careers in contemporary jazz, collaborating with influential names such as Clark Terry, Maria Schneider and Terry Lynn Carrington, working with large and small ensembles, and responding to various commissions to compose for jazz orchestras around the globe.\r\nFor their Whirlwind debut, the Jensens have realized a long-held ambition &#x2013; to write for and perform in the more intimate setting of a quintet, combining their intuitive, sibling trust with the creativity of renowned guitarist Ben Monder and the foundational artistry of bassist Fraser Hollins and drummer Jon Wikan. The particular rapport within this grouping is expressed by Christine (composer of half of this album&#x2019;s material), describing the environment as being less about soloing, but with an emphasis on the question, &#x201C;How are we all going to dive into this pool and swim together.&#x201D; The resulting immersion, recorded in the studio across two days, sounds both live and organic, with Ingrid confirming her close relationship with her sister: &#x201C;It doesn&#x2019;t actually feel like we&#x2019;re producing. We already have this flow which continues as we perform together &#x2013; we can find space, and craziness, and find our way in and out of it, as well.&#x201D; - Whirlwind Recordings","last_updated":"2017-06-25T12:01:36.450Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:276e30c133e74e9fc1c0d1ec0acc715fb6d00b39","dn":"Ingrid &amp; Christine Jensen 2016 Infinitude","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"276e30c133e74e9fc1c0d1ec0acc715fb6d00b39","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,110,48,193,51,231,78,159,193,192,209,236,10,204,113,95,182,208,11,57]},"name":"Ingrid &amp; Christine Jensen 2016 Infinitude","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
