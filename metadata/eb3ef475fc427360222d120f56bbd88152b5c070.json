Half-orphaned, a Dubliner by birth, but a man who would always insist he was English, Jonathan Swift (1667-1745) was a figure of great contradictions. An essayist, political pamphleteer, poet, and cleric who became dean of St. Patrick&apos;s Cathedral in Dublin, Swift satirized the powerful but aspired to political greatness, mocked men&apos;s vanity but held himself in high esteem, and was a religious moralizer famed for his malice - a man sharply aware of humanity&apos;s flaws, but no less susceptible to them. At once a revealing biography of a life that encompasses writing on religion, class, sex, power, and poverty and a portrait of the foremost political writer of his day, Jonathan Swift draws a vivid and nuanced account of an extraordinary man and a turbulent period of history","last_updated":"2017-05-23T18:54:26.189Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb3ef475fc427360222d120f56bbd88152b5c070","dn":"John Stubbs - Jonathan Swift 2017 RETAiL ePUB eBOOK-DiSTRiBUTiON","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"eb3ef475fc427360222d120f56bbd88152b5c070","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,62,244,117,252,66,115,96,34,45,18,15,86,187,216,129,82,181,192,112]},"name":"John Stubbs - Jonathan Swift 2017 RETAiL ePUB eBOOK-DiSTRiBUTiON","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
