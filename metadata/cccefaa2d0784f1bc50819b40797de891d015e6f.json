The album is from his seventh HBO special Doin&apos; It Again, with some segments omitted, and others rearranged.\r\n\r\nThe title passes as a parental advisory label as well, due to the fact there is profanity and adult content. A warning in the liner notes to the album reads:\r\n\r\n &quot;This recording contains no backmasking or subliminal suggestions. All messages\r\nfrom the Devil are recorded clearly and audibly in standard American English.&quot;\r\n\r\nAnother warning states &quot;Please! Try not to commit suicide after listening to this album.&quot;","last_updated":"2017-06-06T12:03:55.868Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:cccefaa2d0784f1bc50819b40797de891d015e6f","dn":"George Carlin - Parental Advisory-Explicit Lyrics (MP3)[=Faith=]","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"cccefaa2d0784f1bc50819b40797de891d015e6f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,206,250,162,208,120,79,27,197,8,25,180,7,151,222,137,29,1,94,111]},"name":"George Carlin - Parental Advisory-Explicit Lyrics (MP3)[=Faith=]","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
