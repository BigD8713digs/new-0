Those are lessons he shares, often unknowingly, with his mom, Lauren Casper.\r\n\r\nFor Lauren, living with Mareto is a lot like playing the telephone game. He blurts out little phrases that have their origin in something he saw or heard, but by the time they make their way through his mind and back out of his mouth, they&apos;ve transformed - often into beautiful truths about living a simple, authentic, love- and joy-filled life.\r\n\r\nFrom &quot;it&apos;s okay about it&quot;, a simple reminder that even when life is painful or difficult, things will be okay because God promises never to leave or forsake his children, to &quot;you&apos;re making me feelings&quot;, which teaches the importance of leaning in to one&apos;s emotions and, in doing so, sharing a piece of oneself with loved ones, Mareto&apos;s simple yet profound wisdom is a reminder to embrace the broken beauty of life, to believe in a God bigger than human comprehension, and to love others even when it doesn&apos;t make sense.\r\n\r\nFor all those looking to recapture the faith, simplicity, wonder, hope, courage, and joy of life, It&apos;s Okay About It provides a guide to look inward and live outward, to discover the most wide open and beautiful life possible.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-08-25T12:01:02.899Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc8ab8a627c2cd3aa6517c2a764ae3fbf1167c92","dn":"Its Okay About It by Lauren Casper 2017 RETAiL ePUB eBOOK-DiSTRi","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"bc8ab8a627c2cd3aa6517c2a764ae3fbf1167c92","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,138,184,166,39,194,205,58,166,81,124,42,118,74,227,251,241,22,124,146]},"name":"Its Okay About It by Lauren Casper 2017 RETAiL ePUB eBOOK-DiSTRi","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
