Since the 19th century, they have stood apart, these inhabitants of Negroland, &quot;a small region of Negro America where residents were sheltered by a certain amount of privilege and plenty&quot;. Reckoning with the strictures and demands of Negroland at crucial historical moments - the Civil Rights Movement, the dawn of feminism, the fallacy of postracial America - Margo Jefferson brilliantly charts the twists and turns of a life informed by psychological and moral contradictions. Aware as it is of heart-wrenching despair and depression, this book is a triumphant paean to the grace of perseverance.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-04-11T15:09:00.828Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:ddde4651de0ab44a2c6427ce1184fd0e54f0732b","dn":"Negroland: A Memoir by Margo Jefferson EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"ddde4651de0ab44a2c6427ce1184fd0e54f0732b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,222,70,81,222,10,180,74,44,100,39,206,17,132,253,14,84,240,115,43]},"name":"Negroland: A Memoir by Margo Jefferson EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
