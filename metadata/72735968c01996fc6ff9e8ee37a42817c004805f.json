Martin Dempsey and 41-year-old UC Berkeley associate professor Ori Brafman have been friends for almost 10 years. Though they have almost nothing in common, their collaboration has produced a powerful message. Their new book, Radical Inclusion, examines today&#x2019;s leadership landscape and describes the change it demands of leaders.\r\n\r\nDempsey and Brafman persuasively explain that today&#x2019;s leaders are in competition for the trust and confidence of those they lead more than ever before. They assert that the nature of power is changing and should not be measured by degree of control alone. They offer principles for adaptation and bring them to life with examples from business, academia, government, and the military.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-03-19T12:00:36.420Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:72735968c01996fc6ff9e8ee37a42817c004805f","dn":"Radical Inclusion by Martin Dempsey, Ori Brafman EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"72735968c01996fc6ff9e8ee37a42817c004805f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,115,89,104,192,25,150,252,111,249,232,238,55,164,40,23,192,4,128,95]},"name":"Radical Inclusion by Martin Dempsey, Ori Brafman EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
