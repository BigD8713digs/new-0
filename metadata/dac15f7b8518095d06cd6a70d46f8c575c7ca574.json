When she was a child, the border zone was rumored to be an easier crossing point into the West than the Berlin Wall, and it swarmed with soldiers and spies. On holidays in the &quot;Red Riviera&quot; on the Black Sea, she remembers playing on the beach only miles from a bristling electrified fence whose barbs pointed inward toward the enemy: the citizens of the totalitarian regime.\r\n\r\nKassabova discovers a place that has been shaped by successive forces of history: the Soviet and Ottoman empires, and, older still, myth and legend. Her exquisite portraits of fire walkers, smugglers, treasure hunters, botanists, and border guards populate the book. There are also the ragged men and women who have walked across Turkey from Syria and Iraq. But there seem to be nonhuman forces at work here too: This densely forested landscape is rich with curative springs and Thracian tombs, and the tug of the ancient world, of circular time and animism, is never far off.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-09-05T12:00:28.147Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:dac15f7b8518095d06cd6a70d46f8c575c7ca574","dn":"Border_ A Journey to the Edge of Europe by Kapka Kassabova ePUB ","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"dac15f7b8518095d06cd6a70d46f8c575c7ca574","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,193,95,123,133,24,9,93,6,205,106,112,212,111,140,87,92,124,165,116]},"name":"Border_ A Journey to the Edge of Europe by Kapka Kassabova ePUB ","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
