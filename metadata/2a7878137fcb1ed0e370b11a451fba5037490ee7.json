Transformational change may be seen as fundamentally different from other kinds of change. A part of this process is often deep level cultural change. At the individual level this may be traumatic, but at the strategic level, such change can prove essential.\r\n\r\nAchieving Transformational Change in Academic Libraries explores the purpose and nature of &#x2018;Transformational Change&#x2019; and its exponents, and discusses the benefits and limitations of its place in an academic library setting. The title is divided into five chapters, covering: a definition of transformational change; drivers of transformational change and its place in a strategic change agenda; selling the vision of cultural change; human resource issues and cultural change; and the nature of change as a constant.\r\nProvides innovative interdisciplinary research\r\nOffers context-free, practical examples of the role of transformational leadership in achieving cultural change and strategic organisational development\r\nExplores the sometimes ambiguous relationship between transformational and transactional leadership","last_updated":"2017-06-10T12:00:22.340Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a7878137fcb1ed0e370b11a451fba5037490ee7","dn":"Achieving Transformational Change in Academic Libraries","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"2a7878137fcb1ed0e370b11a451fba5037490ee7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,120,120,19,127,203,30,208,227,112,177,26,69,31,186,80,55,73,14,231]},"name":"Achieving Transformational Change in Academic Libraries","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
