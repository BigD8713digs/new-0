A natural storyteller, Grosz writes about the remarkable characters he met - on both sides of the law - as he matched wits with elk poachers, salmon snaggers, commercial-market duck hunters, and a host of other law-breakers. Best of all, though, these stories are so remarkably entertaining you won&apos;t want to put them down. Wildlife Wars is the winner of the 2000 National Outdoor Book Award, Nature and the Environment Category.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-11-02T12:04:37.783Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:0187097bdd29cf86c9a76e1aae4d22a6251d9f71","dn":"Wildlife Wars by Terry Grosz EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"0187097bdd29cf86c9a76e1aae4d22a6251d9f71","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,135,9,123,221,41,207,134,201,167,110,26,174,77,34,166,37,29,159,113]},"name":"Wildlife Wars by Terry Grosz EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
