They are also experiencing a need for meaningful connection and community.&quot;\r\n\r\nThe membership-based business is a problem solver for both businesses and individuals. It spares people from the duties of ownership and provides a feeling of commonality and affiliation. For businesses it offers the opportunity to create a &quot;forever customer&quot; who remains loyal and participatory, even as the company shifts and changes. Membership allows for building direct relationships and continuously generates a data stream that can be tapped for a variety of purposes.\r\n\r\nUltimately it provides the cachet of belonging.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-07-02T12:14:22.324Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:60de206bd58f870dd66896b6b5a2c07eb2d4b5a4","dn":"The Membership Economy by Robbie Kellman Baxter AZW","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"60de206bd58f870dd66896b6b5a2c07eb2d4b5a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,222,32,107,213,143,135,13,214,104,150,182,181,162,192,126,178,212,181,164]},"name":"The Membership Economy by Robbie Kellman Baxter AZW","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
