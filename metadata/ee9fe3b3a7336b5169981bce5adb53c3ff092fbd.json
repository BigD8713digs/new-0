His impressionistic take on the notorious Charles Starkweather killing spree of the late 1950s uses a serial-killer narrative as a springboard for an oblique teenage romance, lovingly and idiosyncratically enacted by Martin Sheen and Sissy Spacek. The film introduced many of the elements that would earn Malick his passionate following: the enigmatic approach to narrative and character, the unusual use of voice-over, the juxtaposition of human violence with natural beauty, the poetic investigation of American dreams and nightmares. This debut has spawned countless imitations, but none have equaled its strange sublimity.\r\n\r\n <a href=\"\nhttps://www.criterion.com/films/28406-badlands\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://www.criterion.com/films/28406-badlands</a>","last_updated":"2018-01-06T12:01:47.850Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee9fe3b3a7336b5169981bce5adb53c3ff092fbd","dn":"Badlands.1973.Criterion.1080p.BluRay.x264-POOP","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"ee9fe3b3a7336b5169981bce5adb53c3ff092fbd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,159,227,179,167,51,107,81,105,152,27,206,90,219,83,195,255,9,47,189]},"name":"Badlands.1973.Criterion.1080p.BluRay.x264-POOP","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
