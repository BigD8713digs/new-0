A wedding invitation arrives in the mail: Your boyfriend of the past nine years is engaged to someone else. You can&apos;t say yes - it would be too awkward - and you can&apos;t say no - it would look like defeat. On your desk are a series of invitations to half-baked literary events around the world.\r\n\r\nQuestion: How do you arrange to skip town?\r\n\r\nAnswer: You accept them all.\r\n\r\nWhat would possibly go wrong?\r\n\r\nArthur Less will almost fall in love in Paris, almost fall to his death in Berlin, barely escape to a Moroccan ski chalet from a Saharan sandstorm, accidentally book himself as the (only) writer-in-residence at a Christian Retreat Center in Southern India, and encounter, on a desert island in the Arabian Sea, the last person on Earth he wants to face. Somewhere in there: He will turn 50. Through it all there is his first love. And there is his last.\r\n\r\nBecause despite all these mishaps, missteps, misunderstandings, and mistakes, Less is, above all, a love story.\r\n\r\nA scintillating satire of the American abroad, a rumination on time and the human heart, a bittersweet romance of chances lost, by an author the New York Times has hailed as &quot;inspired, lyrical&quot;, &quot;elegiac&quot;, and &quot;ingenious&quot; as well as &quot;too sappy by half&quot;, Less shows a writer at the peak of his talents raising the curtain on our shared human comedy.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-08-07T12:02:10.740Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:13a891ed74effe8430dde3f6ef6ca96f12243db1","dn":"Less_ A Novel by Andrew Sean Greer ePUB eBOOK-ZAK","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"13a891ed74effe8430dde3f6ef6ca96f12243db1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,168,145,237,116,239,254,132,48,221,227,246,239,108,169,111,18,36,61,177]},"name":"Less_ A Novel by Andrew Sean Greer ePUB eBOOK-ZAK","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
