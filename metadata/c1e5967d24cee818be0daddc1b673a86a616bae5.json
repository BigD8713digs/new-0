Social and economic issues, even national security, have become loud, violent flash points for political rivals in the government, in the media, and on the streets. This collective derangement has a name: mass hysteria.\r\n\r\nIn his new book, Stop Mass Hysteria, number-one NYT best-selling author Michael Savage not only deconstructs the left&apos;s unhinged response to traditional American values like borders, language, and culture, but takes the reader on an unprecedented journey through mass hysteria&apos;s long history in the US. From Christopher Columbus to the Salem witch trials to the so-called &quot;Red Scares&quot; of the 1930s and &apos;40s and much more, Dr. Savage recounts the many times collective insanity has gripped the American public - often prompted by sinister politicians with ulterior motives.\r\n\r\nDr. Savage provides vital context for the common elements of dozens of outbreaks of mass hysteria in the past, their causes, their short- and long-term effects, and the tactics of the puppet masters who duped gullible masses into fearing threats both real and imagined. By shining a light on the true nature and causes of American mass hysteria in the past, Savage provides an insightful look into who and what is causing dangerous unrest in our lives - and why.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-10-14T12:05:26.648Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:c1e5967d24cee818be0daddc1b673a86a616bae5","dn":"Stop Mass Hysteria by Michael Savage EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"c1e5967d24cee818be0daddc1b673a86a616bae5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,229,150,125,36,206,232,24,190,13,173,220,27,103,58,134,166,22,186,229]},"name":"Stop Mass Hysteria by Michael Savage EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
