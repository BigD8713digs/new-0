Radiant, headstrong Sophia and her shy, brilliant daughter, Margaret, possess powerful charms to ward off loneliness, despair, and the human misery that often beats a path to their door. And they are protected by the eccentric wisdom and muscular love of the remarkable matriarch Charlie Kate, a solid, uncompromising, self-taught healer who treats everything from boils to broken bones to broken hearts.\r\n\r\nSophia, Margaret, and Charlie Kate find strength in a time when women almost always depended on men, and their bond deepens as each one experiences love and loss during World War II.\r\n\r\nCharms for the Easy Life is a passionate, luminous, and exhilarating story about embracing what life has to offer...even if it means finding it in unconventional ways.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-01-26T12:00:47.884Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e54a0e4252a93d8ed6a871bcef8fc7380da0b58","dn":"Charms for the Easy Life by Kaye Gibbons EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"2e54a0e4252a93d8ed6a871bcef8fc7380da0b58","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,84,160,228,37,42,147,216,237,106,135,27,206,248,252,115,128,218,11,88]},"name":"Charms for the Easy Life by Kaye Gibbons EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
