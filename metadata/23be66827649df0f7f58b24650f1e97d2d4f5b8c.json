The single &quot;Hammer Horror&quot; went to number 44 on the U.K. singles chart, but the remaining tracks from the album spin, leap, and pirouette with Bush&apos;s vocal dramatics, most of them dissipating into a mist rather than hovering around long enough to be memorable. Her fairytale essence wraps itself around tracks like &quot;In Search of Peter Pan,&quot; &quot;Kashka From Baghdad,&quot; and &quot;Oh England My Lionheart,&quot; but unravels before any substance can be heard. &quot;Wow&quot; does the best job at expressing her voice as it waves and flutters through the chorus, with a melody that shimmers in a peculiar but compatible manner. Some of the tracks, such as &quot;Coffee Homeground&quot; or &quot;In the Warm Room,&quot; bask in their own subtle obscurity, a trait that Bush improved upon later in her career but couldn&apos;t secure on this album. Lionheart acts as a gauge more than a complete album, as Bush is trying to see how many different ways she can sound vocally colorful, even enigmatic, rather than focus on her material&apos;s content and fluidity. Hearing Lionheart after listening to Never for Ever or The Dreaming album, it&apos;s apparent how quickly Bush had progressed both vocally and in her writing in such a short time. - Mike DeGagne, AMG","last_updated":"2017-08-20T12:04:34.471Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:23be66827649df0f7f58b24650f1e97d2d4f5b8c","dn":"Kate Bush 1978 Lionheart (vinyl)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"23be66827649df0f7f58b24650f1e97d2d4f5b8c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,190,102,130,118,73,223,15,127,88,178,70,80,241,233,125,45,79,91,140]},"name":"Kate Bush 1978 Lionheart (vinyl)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
