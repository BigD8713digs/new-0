He also needs to find out why someone sent the president an ancient, intricately carved comb with an ivory inlay of a two-headed dragon. Though familiar with Korea&#x2019;s language and culture, Nate knows little of its troubled history. Beautiful and mysterious embassy aide Anna Carlson believes it&#x2019;s time he learns, starting with the extraordinary story of Korea&#x2019;s last queen.\r\n\r\nSeoul, 1866. The beautiful orphan Ja-young is chosen to be the child bride of Gojong, Korea&#x2019;s boy king. Highly intelligent but shy, Ja-young faces a choice: she can be a stone queen - silent and submissive - or she can be a dragon queen and oppose enemies and empires that try to rule Korea during the age of imperialism. Her choice leads her to forge a legend that will endure far beyond her lifetime.\r\n\r\nThe more Nate discovers, the more he comes to realize that Queen Min&#x2019;s story is still relevant today. Now the choice is up to him: be submissive and accepting&#x2026;or change the world.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-10-28T12:00:17.081Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:361815f1f330a5780004457d12f6ff4553c4ae70","dn":"The Dragon Queen by William Andrews EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"361815f1f330a5780004457d12f6ff4553c4ae70","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,24,21,241,243,48,165,120,0,4,69,125,18,246,255,69,83,196,174,112]},"name":"The Dragon Queen by William Andrews EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
