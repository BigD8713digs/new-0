By 1500, they were printed and numbered in their millions. The invention of Johann Gutenberg had caused a revolution: printing by movable type.\r\n\r\nBorn in 1400 in Mainz, Germany, Gutenberg struggled against a background of plague and religious upheaval to bring his remarkable invention to light. His story is full of paradoxes: his ambition was to reunite all Christendom, but his invention shattered it; he aimed to make a fortune, but was cruelly denied the fruits of his life&apos;s work. Yet history remembers him as a visionary; his discovery marks the beginning of the modern world.\r\n\r\nPaperback: 304 pages\r\nPublisher: Transworld Publishers (May 1, 2010)","last_updated":"2017-12-13T12:00:35.813Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:389f70745f9cb0f5caafc2d78fd30929686a8222","dn":"The Gutenberg Revolution: How Printing Changed the Course of...","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"389f70745f9cb0f5caafc2d78fd30929686a8222","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,159,112,116,95,156,176,245,202,175,194,215,143,211,9,41,104,106,130,34]},"name":"The Gutenberg Revolution: How Printing Changed the Course of...","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
