As Prankster Ken Babbs puts it in the liner notes, this previously unreleased concert film &quot;is a time capsule, a vessel full of exuberant free spirit as exhibited by the enraptured, edified, and satisfied concertgoers, a spirit that can still resound, that can still fill our hearts with joy, with compassion, with that sense and knowledge of our oneness, our open sharing and caring and the belief that the goodness inherent in all of us will continue to shine just as it did in Veneta, Oregon, in 1972. \r\n\r\n:)","last_updated":"2017-06-21T12:00:30.645Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:c7ae7ee441f420386bfd7921111cf0bd0647f46f","dn":"Grateful Dead - Sunshine Daydream 1972 (2013) 3CD ","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"c7ae7ee441f420386bfd7921111cf0bd0647f46f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,174,126,228,65,244,32,56,107,253,121,33,17,28,240,189,6,71,244,111]},"name":"Grateful Dead - Sunshine Daydream 1972 (2013) 3CD ","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
