His unique approach - thematic rather than verse by verse - makes the ancient treatise eminently accessible. In a world that seems spellbound by argument over dialogue, vi-vaad over sam-vaad, Devdutt highlights how Krishna nudges Arjuna to understand rather than judge his relationships. This becomes relevant today when we are increasingly indulging and isolating the self (self-improvement, self-actualization, self-realization - even selfies!). We forget that we live in an ecosystem of others, where we can nourish each other with food, love and meaning, even when we fight. So let My Gita inform your Gita.\r\n <a href=\"\nhttps://www.audible.com.au/pd/Religion-Spirituality/My-Gita-Audiobook/B0711D7647\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://www.audible.com.au/pd/Religion-Spirituality/My-Gita-Audiobook/B0711D7647</a>","last_updated":"2017-12-11T12:00:44.043Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:eff52c33213b435cc42c7d1d2be335f5b24ceb5d","dn":"Devdutt Pattanaik - My Gita (Unabridged) - 2017","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"eff52c33213b435cc42c7d1d2be335f5b24ceb5d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,245,44,51,33,59,67,92,196,44,125,29,43,227,53,245,178,76,235,93]},"name":"Devdutt Pattanaik - My Gita (Unabridged) - 2017","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
