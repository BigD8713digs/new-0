Now she&apos;s back with a legacy work on Titus 2 and its powerful vision for women.\r\n\r\nFrom Nancy:\r\n\r\n&quot;Cross-generational community between women is the biblical antidote for being chronically, hopelessly overwhelmed, as so many of us are.\r\n\r\n&quot;When older women come out of their protective cocoons to invest themselves in the lives of younger women, whole families and churches feel the blessing. When young moms and singles widen their peer groups to include women who have already braved the same rapids and lived to tell about it, both sides of the relationship are strengthened and grow. We all, in different ways and in different seasons, need to be on both the giving and receiving end of this life-to-life process.\r\n\r\n&quot;So I invite you to join me as we look to God&apos;s word for his perspective on the character, commitments, and attitudes of godly women - and his prescribed process for helping us live out these virtues not only today, but from generation to generation.&quot;\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-09-02T12:11:52.962Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:d75bb04a8a0da6b04cd8825a50574deb2c9a79ed","dn":"Adorned by Nancy DeMoss Wolgemuth EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"d75bb04a8a0da6b04cd8825a50574deb2c9a79ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,91,176,74,138,13,166,176,76,216,130,90,80,87,77,235,44,154,121,237]},"name":"Adorned by Nancy DeMoss Wolgemuth EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
