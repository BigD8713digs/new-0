Fievel Mousekewitz and his \r\nfamily of Russian-Jewish mice escape from their homeland in the late 1800s, \r\nboarding a boat headed toward America to evade the Czarist rule of the Russian cats. \r\nFievel, however, is separated from his family upon his arrival in New York City, \r\nand he discovers to his horror that there are cats in America too (his father said \r\nthere weren&apos;t). Fievel meets his share of friendly and hostile mice, and he \r\neventually befriends a cat as well. Former Disney animator Don Bluth co-produced \r\nand directed this often heartwarming yarn, the first animated feature presented by \r\nSteven Spielberg, and it has its charms despite a number of cliche situations.\r\n\r\n02 An American Tail Fievel Goes West 1991.\r\nSome time after the Mousekewitz&apos;s have settled in America, they find that they are \r\nstill having problems with the threat of cats. That makes them eager to try another \r\nhome out in the west, where they are promised that mice and cats live in peace. \r\nUnfortunately, the one making this claim is an oily con artist named Cat R. Waul \r\nwho is intent on his own sinister plan. Unaware of this, the Mousekewitz&apos;s begin \r\ntheir journey west, while their true cat friend, Tiger, follows intent on following \r\nhis girlfriend gone in the same direction.\r\n\r\nInfo.\r\n=&gt;-Language : English.\r\n=&gt;-Chapters : 20 : 9.\r\n=&gt;-File Sizes : 1.06 GiB : 1 01 GiB.\r\n=&gt;-Overall bit rate : 1 892 kbps.\r\n=&gt;-Movie Runtime : 1h20min : 1h14min.\r\n\r\nVideo.\r\n=&gt;-Codec : H.264/MPEG-4 AVC.\r\n=&gt;-Aspect Ratio : 16:9.\r\n=&gt;-Resolution : 1 280 x 720.\r\n=&gt;-Bit rate : 1 444 kbps.\r\n\r\nAudio 1 English.\r\n=&gt;-Codec : mp4a: MPEG-4 AAC LC.\r\n=&gt;-Channels : 2 channel.\r\n=&gt;-Bit Rate : 112 kbps.\r\n=&gt;-Maximum bit rate : 212 kbps.\r\n\r\nAudio 2 English.\r\n=&gt;-Codec : Digital Audio Compression AC-3.\r\n=&gt;-Channels : 6 channels-Front L C R, Side: L R, LFE.\r\n=&gt;-Bit Rate : 320 kbps.\r\n=&gt;-Bit rate mode : Constant","last_updated":"2018-07-01T12:03:58.715Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:42449ca0e40e6bb2ed27ce474f25aa7a43a777b0","dn":"An American Tail 1 And 2 - Animation 1986-1991 Eng Subs 720p","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"42449ca0e40e6bb2ed27ce474f25aa7a43a777b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,68,156,160,228,14,107,178,237,39,206,71,79,37,170,122,67,167,119,176]},"name":"An American Tail 1 And 2 - Animation 1986-1991 Eng Subs 720p","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
