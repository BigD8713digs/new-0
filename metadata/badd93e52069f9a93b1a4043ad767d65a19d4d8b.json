But as the airwaves resound with the haranguing of preachers and pundits, who speaks for the millions who find no joy in whittling the wonder of existence to a simple yes/no choice?\r\n\r\nLesley Hazleton does. In this provocative, brilliant book, she gives voice to the case for agnosticism, breaks it free of its stereotypes as watered-down atheism or amorphous &quot;seeking&quot;, and celebrates it as a reasoned, revealing, and sustaining stance toward life. Stepping over the lines imposed by rigid conviction, she draws on philosophy, theology, psychology, science, and more to explore, with curiosity and passion, the vital role of mystery in a deceptively information-rich world; to ask what we mean by the search for meaning; to invoke the humbling yet elating perspective of infinity; to challenge received ideas about death; and to reconsider what &quot;the soul&quot; might be.\r\n\r\nInspired and inspiring, Agnostic recasts the question of belief not as a problem to be solved but as an invitation to an ongoing, open-ended adventure of the mind.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-12-30T12:03:26.935Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:badd93e52069f9a93b1a4043ad767d65a19d4d8b","dn":"Agnostic_ A Spirited Manifesto by Lesley Hazelton EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"badd93e52069f9a93b1a4043ad767d65a19d4d8b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,221,147,229,32,105,249,169,59,26,64,67,173,118,125,101,161,157,77,139]},"name":"Agnostic_ A Spirited Manifesto by Lesley Hazelton EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
