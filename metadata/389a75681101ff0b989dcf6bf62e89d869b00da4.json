The novel provides a darkly humorous perspective of India&apos;s class struggle in a globalized world as told through a retrospective narration from Balram Halwai, a village boy.  In detailing Balram&apos;s journey first to Delhi, where he works as a chauffeur to a rich landlord, and then to Bangalore, the place to which he flees after killing his master and stealing his money, the novel examines issues of religion, caste, loyalty, corruption and poverty in India.\r\n\r\nBETWEEN THE ASSASSINATIONS (2009), a collection of interlinked short stories, charts the lives of the residents of an Indian town over a 7-year period between the assassinations of Indira Gandhi and her son Rajiv.  In the multi-layered LAST MAN IN TOWER (2011), the story of a struggle for a slice of shining Mumbai real estate, Adiga continues his project of shining a light on the changing face of India, bringing us a picture that is as compelling as it is complex to decipher.  His most recent work, SELECTION DAY (2016), the story of two cricketing brothers divided by success and failure, holds up a mirror to the shattered dreams of a nation.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following books are in ePUB format:\r\n\r\n* Between the Assassinations (Free Press, 2009)\r\n* Last Man in Tower (Knopf, 2011)\r\n* Selection Day (Picador, 2016)\r\n* White Tiger, The (Free Press, 2008)\r\n\r\n____________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTACT ME: You can reach me with comments, suggestions, requests, error reports, etc., at TPB&apos;s forum, SuprBay (you will need to register an account):\r\n <a href=\"\nhttps://pirates-forum.org/User-workerbee\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://pirates-forum.org/User-workerbee</a>\r\n\r\nPLEASE HELP TO SEED!
