Devastating news to most young women, especially those who love children and have always dreamed of having their own family. But Riley&apos;s response was: Kenya has given me a thousand children.\r\n\r\nRiley&apos;s stories of her trips to Kenya, her struggles to figure out how to best serve and care for these people she has fallen in love with, and her own unexpected health issues are funny, compelling, and gripping. Readers will find that God writes surprising stories in the lives of those who follow him. Hard to put down, Riley Unlikely will inspire you to pursue your dreams and make a difference in your own world - and around the world","last_updated":"2017-06-06T12:05:08.619Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:72a347ec60587e3a846d183b3e92b8a06fbd0669","dn":"Riley Banks Snyder - Riley Unlikely 2016 RETAiL ePUB eBOOK-DiSTR","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"72a347ec60587e3a846d183b3e92b8a06fbd0669","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,163,71,236,96,88,126,58,132,109,24,59,62,146,184,160,111,189,6,105]},"name":"Riley Banks Snyder - Riley Unlikely 2016 RETAiL ePUB eBOOK-DiSTR","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
