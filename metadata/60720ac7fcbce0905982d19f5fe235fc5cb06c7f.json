Reviving the ancient philosophy of &quot;cosmopolitanism&quot;, a school of thought that dates to the Cynics of the fourth century BC, Appiah traces its influence on the ethical legacies of the Enlightenment, the French Revolution, and the UN&apos;s Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Raised in Ghana, educated in England, and now a distinguished professor in the United States, Appiah promises to create a new era in which warring factions will finally put aside their supposed ideological differences and will recognize that the fundamental values held by all human beings will usher in a new era of global understanding.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-08-07T12:01:36.760Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:60720ac7fcbce0905982d19f5fe235fc5cb06c7f","dn":"Cosmopolitanism_ Ethics in a World of Strangers by Anthony Appia","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"60720ac7fcbce0905982d19f5fe235fc5cb06c7f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,114,10,199,252,188,224,144,89,130,209,159,95,226,53,252,92,176,108,127]},"name":"Cosmopolitanism_ Ethics in a World of Strangers by Anthony Appia","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
