(&#x201C;one of the most talked-about books of the year&#x201D; - Time Magazine) and the New York Times best seller Women in Clothes comes a daring book about whether to have children.\r\n\r\nIn Motherhood, Sheila Heti asks what is gained and what is lost when a woman becomes a mother, treating the most consequential decision of early adulthood with the candor, originality, and humor that have won Heti international acclaim and made How Should a Person Be? required reading for a generation.\r\n\r\nIn her late 30s, when her friends are asking when they will become mothers, the narrator of Heti&#x2019;s intimate and urgent book considers whether she will do so at all. In a narrative spanning several years, casting among the influence of her peers, partner, and her duties to her forebearers, she struggles to make a wise and moral choice. After seeking guidance from philosophy, her body, mysticism, and chance, she discovers her answer much closer to home.\r\n\r\nMotherhood is a courageous, keenly felt, and starkly original book that will surely spark lively conversations about womanhood, parenthood, and about how - and for whom - to live.   \r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-05-07T12:04:55.617Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:106beb2233e05779e449463acf2cff22a704c88d","dn":"Motherhood: A Novel by Sheila Heti EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"106beb2233e05779e449463acf2cff22a704c88d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,107,235,34,51,224,87,121,228,73,70,58,207,44,255,34,167,4,200,141]},"name":"Motherhood: A Novel by Sheila Heti EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
