It is virtual yes, but it is still a fantastic version that I hope you will enjoy for years to come!\r\n\r\nOde To Freedom - solo vocal performers please be in touch with me if interested to perform for a possible v4.0.\r\n\r\n(The sound has been rendered offline and added to the video after the fact, so my computer recorded as best as possible. For the video recording, all plug-ins have been disabled but that matters not as what you are hearing is the full mix with full plug-ins.)\r\n\r\nChangelog from v3.0: Doubled each of the 4 chorus (non-solo) parts with separate libraries, to make 8 in total - in addition to the 4 solo tracks (12 vocal tracks in total = 8 chorus, 4 solo.) In addition, Timpani and Gran Cassa raised in volume very slightly.\r\n\r\nDirect download of the .wav 44.1 kHz PCM file","last_updated":"2017-09-07T12:05:48.498Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:e717f5df8afae2695a5b2176aa8d1a34d309e8ce","dn":"Beethoven Symphony No. 9 Ode To Joy Virtual Pierman v3.5 1080p","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"e717f5df8afae2695a5b2176aa8d1a34d309e8ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,23,245,223,138,250,226,105,90,91,33,118,170,141,26,52,211,9,232,206]},"name":"Beethoven Symphony No. 9 Ode To Joy Virtual Pierman v3.5 1080p","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
