Not the true creation of something that you love. They may as well be packaging a frozem dinner package cause its all the same what fits where. Such peeps should stay out of music they  got as much sense about what is good or great as I would sharing Pop music and announcing that it is &quot;good&quot;. Ugh...That being said case in point all these so called essentials popping up everywhere WTF? They look like stale under developed rehashed Hits packages been done to death up here just look around.  \r\nSo once again I have stepped up and made this and used my love and enjoyment of the music as my guide not any inane effort to generate numbers.  Just to share what I love with others of a like mind.\r\n\r\nPart 1 So called &quot;Essentials&quot;\r\n\r\nTracklist Disk 1 and 2\r\n\r\n01. Enter Sandman.mp3\r\n02. One.mp3\r\n03.
