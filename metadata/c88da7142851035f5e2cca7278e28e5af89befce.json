Clarke Jr. EPUB\r\n\r\nDavid A. Clarke Jr., known by many as &quot;America&apos;s sheriff&quot;, navigates the choppy waters of race relations, religion, politics, and law enforcement, sharing what it will take to once again become a great nation under God, with liberty and justice for all.\r\n\r\nAmerica has become increasingly divided and polarized in recent years. With growing animosity toward law enforcement professionals, government corruption, disregard for the constitution, and racial tension thanks to the media and hate groups, there seems to be no easy answer in sight.\r\n\r\nBut Sheriff David Clarke knows where we must begin. We must stop blaming others and take ownership of our families, communities, and country. We must face our problems and turn to God for solutions.\r\n\r\nCop Under Fire is not a dry recitation of what has gone wrong in America. Deeply rooted in his personal life story, Sheriff Clarke&apos;s unmatched passion, conviction, and patriotism is a rallying cry for our country. &quot;America&apos;s not perfect. But it still offers every American, black or otherwise, who is willing to work hard, the best chance of experiencing our full potential as human beings,&quot; writes Clarke. &quot;The challenge is to work for a better future without being fixated on the ugly scars of the past.&quot;\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-01-27T12:03:50.427Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:c88da7142851035f5e2cca7278e28e5af89befce","dn":"Cop Under Fire by David A.
