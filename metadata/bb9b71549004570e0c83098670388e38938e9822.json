With everyday grilling, most people cook things with roughly even thickness and they can tell when the meats are done just by looking at them. Try something bigger, like a leg of lamb, a whole turkey, or a full pork shoulder, and they have a problem most grills will completely char the outside long before the inside is cooked to a safe temperature. The solution, of course, is a rotisserie. The Rotisserie Grilling Cookbook shows how to set up, maintain, use and troubleshoot a rotisserie spit. It includes 105 recipes will expand your outdoor cooking repertoire, including a dry-brined Thanksgiving turkey, a whole country ham for other holidays, a whole chicken, duck, game hens, and big cuts like a beef ribeye roast or a leg of lamb. Beyond the meat recipes that are the core of the book, it includes rubs, glazes, and mops that are specifically crafted for long, slow cooking over a rotisserie, and even some ideas, like a spit-roasted whole pineapple, from beyond the world of poultry and meats","last_updated":"2017-08-03T12:00:18.160Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb9b71549004570e0c83098670388e38938e9822","dn":"The Rotisserie Grilling Cookbook Surefire Recipes and Foolproof ","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"bb9b71549004570e0c83098670388e38938e9822","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,155,113,84,144,4,87,14,12,131,9,134,112,56,142,56,147,142,152,34]},"name":"The Rotisserie Grilling Cookbook Surefire Recipes and Foolproof ","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
