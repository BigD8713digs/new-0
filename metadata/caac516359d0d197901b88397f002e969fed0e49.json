He is widely known as a comedic novelist of mid- to late-20th-century British life, but his literary work extended into many genres -- poetry, essays and criticism, short stories, food and drink writing, anthologies, and a number of novels in genres such as science fiction and mystery.\n\nHis first novel, LUCKY JIM (1954), was an immediate success and remains his most popular work.  Its disgruntled antihero, a young university instructor named Jim Dixon, epitomized a newly important social group that had risen by dint of scholarships from lower-middle-class and working-class backgrounds only to find the more comfortable perches still occupied by the well-born.  The novel prompted critics to group Amis with the Angry Young Men, who expressed similar social discontent.  Amis&apos;s next novel, THAT UNCERTAIN FEELING (1955), had a similar antihero.  A visit to Portugal resulted in the novel I LIKE IT HERE (1958), while observations garnered from a teaching stint in the United States were expressed in the novel ONE FAT ENGLISHMAN (1963).\n\nAmis went on to write more than 40 books, including some 20 novels, many volumes of poetry, and several collections of essays.  His apparent lack of sympathy with his characters and his sharply satirical rendering of well-turned dialogue were complemented by his own curmudgeonly public persona.  Notable among his later novels were THE GREEN MAN (1969), JAKE&apos;S THING (1978), and THE OLD DEVILS (Booker Prize, 1986).  As a poet, Amis was a representative member of a group sometimes called &quot;The Movement,&quot; whose poems began appearing in 1956 in the anthology New Lines.  Poets belonging to this school wrote understated and disciplined verse that avoided experimentation and grandiose themes.  In 1990 Amis was knighted, and his MEMOIRS were published in 1991.\n\n\nThe following books are in ePUB format unless otherwise noted:\n\n\n                               == FICTION ==\n\n* Alteration, The (NYRB, 2013)\n* Anti-Death League, The (Harcourt, 1966) -- PDF\n* Biographer&apos;s Moustache, The (Fourth Estate, 2014)\n* Colonel Sun [pseud.
