Appropriately, the second set was much more ambitious than The Singles 81&gt;85, spanning two discs and 20 songs, plus a live version of &quot;Everything Counts.&quot; \r\nThe Singles 86&gt;98 was an album that many fans, both casual and hardcore, waited patiently for, and for good reason -- Depeche Mode were always more effective as a singles band than as album artists. That&apos;s not to say that the double-disc compilation is perfect. DM&apos;s output fluctuated wildly during those 12 years, as the group hit both career highs and lows. It&apos;s possible to hear it all on this set, from &quot;Strangelove&quot; and &quot;Never Let Me Down Again,&quot; through &quot;Personal Jesus&quot; and &quot;Enjoy the Silence,&quot; to &quot;I Feel You&quot; and &quot;Barrel of a Gun.&quot; \r\nIt&apos;s possible that some casual listeners will find that the collection meanders a bit too much for their tastes, but the end result is definitive and, along with The Singles 81&gt;85, ranks as Depeche Mode&apos;s best, most listenable album.
