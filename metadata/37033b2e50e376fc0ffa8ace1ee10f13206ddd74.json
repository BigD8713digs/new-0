The legendary playwright, author, director, and filmmaker pulls no punches in his art or in his politics. And as a former liberal who woke up, Mamet will win over an entirely new audience of others who have grown irate over America&apos;s current direction.\r\n\r\nPlease seed.  Thanks!","last_updated":"2017-05-27T08:58:40.473Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:37033b2e50e376fc0ffa8ace1ee10f13206ddd74","dn":"David Mamet - The Secret Knowledge:On the Dismantling of America","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"37033b2e50e376fc0ffa8ace1ee10f13206ddd74","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,3,59,46,80,227,118,252,15,250,138,206,30,225,15,19,32,109,221,116]},"name":"David Mamet - The Secret Knowledge:On the Dismantling of America","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
