Devki, a loving wife and mother of two beautiful daughters seemingly has a perfect happy family, yet somehow true happiness of being a mother eludes her. Arya, a sensitive girl, believes a daughter comes into a mother&apos;s life, but a mother does not enter that of a daughter. Devki patiently waits for Arya&apos;s love and acceptance as she believes only a mother can truly understand the silence of her child. An unfortunate incident widens the distance between Arya and Devki, to a point of no return. In such a situation a mother has to make a choice &apos;not between&apos; what is wrong or right&apos;, but between &apos;what is wrong and very wrong.&#x201D; MOM is the story of what will a mother do in such a situation. Will she fight for her daughter&apos;s love knowing the consequences she may have to face?\r\nRelease date: July 7, 2017 (USA)\r\nDirector: Ravi Udyawar\r\nMusic composed by: A. R. Rahman\r\n\r\nDont forget to seed","last_updated":"2017-08-27T12:12:43.784Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:afa6eb5e217e6b40537454e205b183c6a7e16a4d","dn":"MOM (2017) 1CD 480p x264 ","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"afa6eb5e217e6b40537454e205b183c6a7e16a4d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,166,235,94,33,126,107,64,83,116,84,226,5,177,131,198,167,225,106,77]},"name":"MOM (2017) 1CD 480p x264 ","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
