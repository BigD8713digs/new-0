Gen. H. G. Moore, J. Galloway EPUB\r\n\r\nMore than 15 years since its original publication, the number-one New York Times best seller We Were Soldiers Once...and Young is still required reading in all branches of the military. Now, Harold G. Moore and Joseph L. Galloway revisit their relationships with 10 American veterans of the battle, as well as Lt. Gen. Nguyen Hu An, who commanded the North Vietnamese Army troops on the other side, and two of his old company commanders.\r\n\r\nMoore and Galloway mix gritty and vivid detail with reverence and respect for their comrades. Their ability to capture man&apos;s sense of heroism and brotherhood, their love for their men and their former enemies, and their fascination with the history of this enigmatic country make for riveting reading. We Are Soldiers Still puts a human face on warfare in a way that will not soon be forgotten.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-06-08T12:00:58.048Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:80433e9c07404b4c2788c4a67b65fc8e8c2dc40a","dn":"We Are Soldiers Still by Lt.
