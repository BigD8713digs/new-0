Said is best known for describing and critiquing &quot;Orientalism&quot;, which he perceived as a constellation of false assumptions underlying Western attitudes toward the East. In Orientalism Said claimed a &quot;subtle and persistent Eurocentric prejudice against Arabo-Islamic peoples and their culture.&quot; He argued that a long tradition of false and romanticized images of Asia and the Middle East in Western culture had served as an implicit justification for Europe and the US&apos; colonial and imperial ambitions. Just as fiercely, he denounced the practice of Arab elites who internalized the US and British orientalists&apos; ideas of Arabic culture. Peter Ganim&apos;s narration gives the work an elegant and knowledgable voice.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-07-17T12:00:49.411Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:20bdc59432d8613db5440c07aa71764d99796f32","dn":"Orientalism by Edward W Said ePUB eBOOK-ZAK","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"20bdc59432d8613db5440c07aa71764d99796f32","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,189,197,148,50,216,97,61,181,68,12,7,170,113,118,77,153,121,111,50]},"name":"Orientalism by Edward W Said ePUB eBOOK-ZAK","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
