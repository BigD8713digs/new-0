He advised the legendary Pompey on his somewhat botched transition from military hero to politician. He lambasted Mark Antony and was master of the smear campaign, as feared for his wit as he was for exposing his opponents&#x2019; sexual peccadilloes. Brilliant, voluble, cranky, a genius of political manipulation but also a true patriot and idealist, Cicero was Rome&#x2019;s most feared politician, one of the greatest lawyers and statesmen of all times. Machiavelli, Queen Elizabeth, John Adams and Winston Churchill all studied his example. No man has loomed larger in the political history of mankind.\r\n\r\nGenre: Non-Fiction &gt; Biographies &amp; Memoirs","last_updated":"2018-09-11T12:18:12.106Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2f03dfb6559f7f063f440d635374f2618e50a65","dn":" Cicero by Anthony Everitt (.epub)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"f2f03dfb6559f7f063f440d635374f2618e50a65","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,240,61,251,101,89,247,240,99,244,64,214,53,55,79,38,24,229,10,101]},"name":" Cicero by Anthony Everitt (.epub)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
