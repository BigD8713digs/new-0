A groundbreaking new perspective on the science of elite sporting performance.\r\n\r\nWhy couldn&apos;t Michael Jordan, master athlete that he was, hit a baseball? Why can&apos;t modern robotics come close to replicating the dexterity of a five-year-old? Why do good quarterbacks always seem to know where their receivers are?\r\n\r\nIn this deeply researched book, sports and business reporter Zach Schonbrun explores what actually drives human movement and its spectacular potential. The groundbreaking work of two neuroscientists in Major League Baseball is only the beginning. Schonbrun traces the fascinating history of motor research and details how new investigations in the brain are helping explain the extraordinary skills of talented performers like Stephen Curry, Tom Brady, Serena Williams, and Lionel Messi; as well as musical virtuosos, dancers, rock climbers, race-car drivers, and more.\r\n\r\nWhether it is timing a 95-mph fastball or reaching for a coffee mug, movement requires extraordinary computation that many take for granted - until now. The Performance Cortex ushers in a new way of thinking about the athletic gifts we strain to see in our cavernous arenas. It&apos;s not about the million-dollar arm anymore. It&apos;s about the million-dollar brain.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-04-18T15:10:51.730Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb3fd608ca7b753bbaf6dcc88f86b0154516e225","dn":"The Performance Cortex by Zach Schonbrun EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"eb3fd608ca7b753bbaf6dcc88f86b0154516e225","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,63,214,8,202,123,117,59,186,246,220,200,143,134,176,21,69,22,226,37]},"name":"The Performance Cortex by Zach Schonbrun EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
