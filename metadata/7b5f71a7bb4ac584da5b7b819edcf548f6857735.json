When our bodies get sick, we often feel out of control - a cycle of fear that leaves us feeling vulnerable and helpless, desperate for medication or tests that will make us well. But illness shouldn&apos;t make us afraid. We do have control over our well-being, contends Dr. Selhub, and we can make choices that can positively influence any health issue, big or small, acute or chronic. It&apos;s all about perception - how you view yourself, your resources, and your circumstances. Drawing on findings in the emerging field of epigenetics, she reveals how we can bolster the mind-body connection and actually change the way our DNA operates.\r\n\r\nIn Your Health Destiny, Dr. Selhub teaches you how to pay attention to your body&apos;s signals, to understand what these signals mean, and to make the right choices that will bring amazing results to your health now and for the future. You will discover ways to prevent disease from happening or getting worse and even find that you can reverse the disease process altogether.\r\n\r\nWe have more power than we think. Your Health Destiny shows you how to harness it to improve your life.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-07-01T12:14:03.375Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b5f71a7bb4ac584da5b7b819edcf548f6857735","dn":"Your Health Destiny by Eva Selhub EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"7b5f71a7bb4ac584da5b7b819edcf548f6857735","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,95,113,167,187,74,197,132,218,91,123,129,158,220,245,72,246,133,119,53]},"name":"Your Health Destiny by Eva Selhub EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
