He was also a Russian spy, driven by passionately held beliefs, whose betrayal and defection to Moscow reverberated for decades. \r\n\r\nChristened &#x2018;Orphan&#x2019; by his Russian recruiter, Maclean was the perfect spy and Britain&#x2019;s most gifted traitor. But as he leaked huge amounts of top-secret intelligence, an international code-breaking operation was rapidly closing in on him. Moments before he was unmasked, Maclean vanished. \r\n\r\nDrawing on a wealth of previously classified material, Roland Philipps now tells this story for the first time in full. Philipps unravels Maclean&#x2019;s character and contradictions: a childhood that was simultaneously liberal and austere; a Cambridge education mixing in Communist circles; a polished diplomat with a tendency to wild binges; a marriage complicated by secrets; an accelerated rise through the Foreign Office and, above all, a gift for deception. Taking us back to the golden age of espionage, A Spy Named Orphan reveals the impact of one of the most dangerous and enigmatic Soviet agents of the 20th century, whose actions heightened the tensions of the Cold War.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-05-08T12:00:44.716Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:d538f6e14ff0f1e2fb3ff6b54f0c4da5cfaef1bf","dn":"A Spy Named Orphan by Roland Philipps EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"d538f6e14ff0f1e2fb3ff6b54f0c4da5cfaef1bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,56,246,225,79,240,241,226,251,63,246,181,79,12,77,165,207,174,241,191]},"name":"A Spy Named Orphan by Roland Philipps EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
