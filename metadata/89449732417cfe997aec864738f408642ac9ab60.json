Murray\r\n\r\nRequirements: .ePUB reader\r\n\r\nOverview: Donald S. Murray spent much of his childhood either playing or working on the moor, chasing sheep across empty acres and cutting and gathering peat for fuel. \r\n\r\nThe Dark Stuff is an examination of how this landscape affected him and others. Donald explores his early life on the Isle of Lewis together with the experiences of those who lived near moors much further afield, from the Highlands and Islands of Scotland to the Netherlands, Germany, Ireland and even Australia. Examining this environment in all its roles and guises, Donald reflects on the ways that for centuries humans have represented the moor in literature, art and folktale, and he reveals how in some countries, these habitats remain an essential aspect of their industrial heritage and working life today.\r\n\r\nGenre: Non-Fiction &gt; History","last_updated":"2018-09-21T12:24:44.944Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:89449732417cfe997aec864738f408642ac9ab60","dn":"The Dark Stuff by Donald S.
