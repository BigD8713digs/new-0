The book deploys PC-BSD and Solaris, representative systems of the major branches of the UNIX family, to illustrate the key concepts. It covers many topics not covered in older, more traditional textbook approaches, such as Python, UNIX System Programming from basics to socket-based network programming using the client-server paradigm, the Zettabyte File System (ZFS), and the highly developed X Windows-based KDE and Gnome GUI desktop environments.\r\n\r\nThe third edition has been fully updated and expanded, with extensive revisions throughout. It features a new tutorial chapter on the Python programming language and its use in UNIX, as well as a complete tutorial on the git command with Github. It includes four new chapters on UNIX system programming and the UNIX API, which describe the use of the UNIX system call interface for file processing, process management, signal handling, interprocess communication (using pipes, FIFOs, and sockets), extensive coverage of internetworking with UNIX TCP/IP using the client-server software, and considerations for the design and implementation of production-quality client-server software using iterative and concurrent servers. It also includes new chapters on UNIX system administration, ZFS, and container virtualization methodologies using iocage, Solaris Jails, and VirtualBox","last_updated":"2017-06-06T12:04:03.936Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:e9fd75d5a34d43228fa27eff791014a3eda59e40","dn":"UNIX: The Textbook, 3rd Edition [2016] [PDF]","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"e9fd75d5a34d43228fa27eff791014a3eda59e40","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,253,117,213,163,77,67,34,143,162,126,255,121,16,20,163,237,165,158,64]},"name":"UNIX: The Textbook, 3rd Edition [2016] [PDF]","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
