Their forte was ballads -- beginning with the 1959 debut single &quot;Come Softly to Me,&quot; they racked up a number of hits over the next three years, and nearly all of them were ballads. The Fleetwoods broke up in 1963, but their songs -- particularly &quot;Come Softly to Me&quot; -- became pop/rock classics of the pre-British Invasion era","last_updated":"2018-08-21T12:04:07.158Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:5351f78e47951f0d0ed0897d28700f9cd5bad455","dn":"The Fleetwoods Greatest Hits","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"5351f78e47951f0d0ed0897d28700f9cd5bad455","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,81,247,142,71,149,31,13,14,208,137,125,40,112,15,156,213,186,212,85]},"name":"The Fleetwoods Greatest Hits","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
