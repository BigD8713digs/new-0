He prepared this comprehensive workbook (with full solutions to every problem) to share his strategies for mastering calculus. This workbook covers a variety of essential calculus skills, including:\r\n\r\n-  derivatives of polynomials, trig functions, exponentials, and logarithms\r\n-  the chain rule, product rule, and quotient rule\r\n-  second derivatives\r\n-  how to find the extreme values of a function\r\n-  limits, including l&#x2019;Hopital&#x2019;s rule\r\n-  antiderivatives of polynomials, trig functions, exponentials, and logarithms\r\n-  definite and indefinite integrals\r\n-  techniques of integration, including substitution, trig sub, and integration by parts\r\n-  multiple integrals\r\n\r\nThe goal of this workbook isn&#x2019;t to cover every possible topic from calculus, but to focus on the most essential skills needed to apply calculus to other subjects, such as physics or engineering.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\nIntroduction\r\n1 DERIVATIVES OF POLYNOMIALS\r\n2 THE CHAIN RULE, PRODUCT RULE, AND QUOTIENT RULE\r\n3 DERIVATIVES OF TRIG FUNCTIONS\r\n4 DERIVATIVES OF EXPONENTIALS\r\n5 DERIVATIVES OF LOGARITHMS\r\n6 SECOND DERIVATIVES\r\n7 EXTREME VALUES\r\n8 LIMITS AND L&#x2019;H&#xD4;PITAL&#x2019;S RULE\r\n9 INTEGRALS OF POLYNOMIALS\r\n10 DEFINITE INTEGRALS\r\n11 INTEGRALS OF TRIG FUNCTIONS\r\n12 INTEGRALS OF EXPONENTIALS AND LOGARITHMS\r\n13 INTEGRATION BY POLYNOMIAL SUBSTITUTION\r\n14 INTEGRATION BY TRIGONOMETRIC SUBSTITUTION\r\n15 INTEGRATION BY PARTS\r\n16 MULTIPLE INTEGRALS\r\n <a href=\"\nhttps://i.postimg.cc/SRQ4Kxw0/Essential_Calculus_Skills_Practice_Workbook_with_Full_Solutions.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://i.postimg.cc/SRQ4Kxw0/Essential_Calculus_Skills_Practice_Workbook_with_Full_Solutions.jpg</a>","last_updated":"2018-09-22T12:38:57.813Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:56b25648794e77c7073b7d62222ec661af3b1fc6","dn":"Essential Calculus Skills Practice Workbook with Full Solutions ","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"56b25648794e77c7073b7d62222ec661af3b1fc6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,178,86,72,121,78,119,199,7,59,125,98,34,46,198,97,175,59,31,198]},"name":"Essential Calculus Skills Practice Workbook with Full Solutions ","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
