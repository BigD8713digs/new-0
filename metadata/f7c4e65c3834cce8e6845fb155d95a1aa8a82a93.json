Years later, Swagger marries Donny&apos;s widow Julie, and together they raise their daughter Nikki on a ranch in the isolated Sawtooth Mountains in Idaho. Although he struggles with the painful legacy of Vietnam, Swagger&apos;s greatest wish, to leave his violent past behind and live quietly with his family, seems to have come true.\r\n\r\nThen one idyllic day, a man, a woman, and a girl set out from the ranch on horseback. High on a ridge above a mountain pass, a thousand yards distant, a calm, cold-eyed man, one of the world&apos;s greatest marksmen, peers through a telescopic site at the three approaching figures. Out of his tortured past, a mortal enemy has once again found Bob the Nailer.\r\n\r\nWith a plot that sweeps from the killing fields of Vietnam to the corridors of power in Washington, to the shadowy plots of the new world order, Stephen Hunter delivers all the complex action his fans demand in a masterful tale of family heartbreak and international intrigue.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-07-16T12:00:27.948Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:f7c4e65c3834cce8e6845fb155d95a1aa8a82a93","dn":"Time to Hunt (Bob Lee Swagger series_book 3) by Stephen Hunter e","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"f7c4e65c3834cce8e6845fb155d95a1aa8a82a93","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,196,230,92,56,52,204,232,230,132,95,177,85,217,90,26,168,168,42,147]},"name":"Time to Hunt (Bob Lee Swagger series_book 3) by Stephen Hunter e","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
