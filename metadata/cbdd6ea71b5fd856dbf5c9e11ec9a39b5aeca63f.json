Surprisingly the four shows that took place at the Old Wardorf, San Francisco over December 2nd and 3rd, were the first live performances by the band on the west coast. Another historic show from an intimate San Francisco venue and available in pre-FM from the KSAN reels, with ultimate sound quality. The mix is superbly balanced.\r\n\r\n    The Old Wardorf was active on 444 Battery Street between 1976 and 1983, before being closed by Bill Graham. Advertising from the time says &#x2018;that dinner will be available at every event and may be purchased in advance for certain 8pm and 11pm shows with best available seating.&#x2019; Imagine finishing your dinner while Metallica or Iggy Pop take to the stage of this 600 capacity venue for the early show.\r\n\r\nYeah they dont have it like that now.\r\n\r\n\r\nTracklist\r\n\r\n\r\n01.
