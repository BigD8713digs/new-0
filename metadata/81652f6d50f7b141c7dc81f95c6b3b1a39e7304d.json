Bob Dalton meets lawyer Tod Jackson and persuades him to defend his kin Ben Dalton in a court case against a \r\ncorrupt land development company. A melee erupts during the trial, resulting in the Daltons needing to shoot their way out of the courtroom. A negative light is cast on the Daltons by \r\ncronies of the land developers and the press. Ben is shot in the back. Unable to get by lawfully, the Daltons rob a stage coach and their reputation as dangerous outlaws spreads. Tod, \r\nmeantime, has fallen in love with Bob Dalton&apos;s fiancee, Julie.
