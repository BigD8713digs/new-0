Citizen Newt is the definitive account of that struggle. Writing with the full cooperation of Speaker Gingrich and the players around him, New York Times best-selling author Craig Shirley captures the events, ideas, failures, and successes of Newton Leroy Gingrich - one of the most complex, influential, and durable political figures of our time.\r\n\r\nReturning to Gingrich&apos;s childhood in Pennsylvania and his formative years as a young history professor, Citizen Newt moves through Gingrich&apos;s first forays into politics and takes readers behind the scenes of the congressman&apos;s crucial role in the Reagan Revolution, his battles with George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton, and his masterly orchestration of 1994&apos;s &quot;Gingrich Revolution&quot; and the Contract with America, which catapulted him to national prominence and forever changed congressional and national politics.\r\n\r\nDrawing upon untold stories from Gingrich and those who know him best - political allies and opponents, Washington insiders and political iconoclasts, Capitol Hill staffers and colleagues - Shirley has crafted a fascinating, humorous, humanizing, and insightful account of a true American original.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-10-02T12:00:46.775Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:0de760d7f286ce209df0d9404c7070fc9b6039e8","dn":"Citizen Newt_ The Making of a Reagan Conservative by Craig Shirl","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"0de760d7f286ce209df0d9404c7070fc9b6039e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,231,96,215,242,134,206,32,157,240,217,64,76,112,112,252,155,96,57,232]},"name":"Citizen Newt_ The Making of a Reagan Conservative by Craig Shirl","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
