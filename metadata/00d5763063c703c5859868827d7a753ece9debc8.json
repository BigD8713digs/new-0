They have always been classified by critics as gothic metal, although the &quot;gothic&quot; influence varies with each album. Their most prominent and well-known sound is described as symphonic metal, although their earlier material, such as debut album Enter, was mostly gothic metal.\r\n\r\nMartin White from Blabbermouth.net gave the album a score of 9 out of 10 stars, stating that &quot;amazingly enough, the thick instrumentation and Sharon&apos;s angelic delivery are never at odds with each other &#x2014; a rare feat when it comes to music as complex and involved as Within Temptation&apos;s is.&quot; \r\n\r\nTracklist\r\n\r\n01The Other Half.mp3\r\n02 Our Farewell.mp3\r\n03 Jane Doe.mp3\r\n04 Ice Queen.mp3\r\n05 Outro.mp3\r\n06 Sabbath Bloody Sabbath (Black Sabbath Cover).mp3\r\n07 Intro.mp3\r\n08.
