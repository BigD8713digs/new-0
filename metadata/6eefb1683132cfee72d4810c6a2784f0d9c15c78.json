H. G. Megson\r\nButterworth-Heinemann | December 2016 | ISBN-10: 0081009143 | PDF | 910 pages | 12 mb\r\n\r\nAircraft Structures for Engineering Students, Sixth Edition, is the leading self-contained aircraft structures course text. It covers all fundamental subjects, including elasticity, structural analysis, airworthiness and aeroelasticity. Now in its sixth edition, the author has expanded the book&#x2019;s coverage of analysis and design of composite materials for use in aircraft, and has added new, real-world and design-based examples, along with new end-of-chapter problems of varying complexity.\r\n\r\n- Expanded coverage of composite materials and structures\r\n- New practical and design-based examples and problems throughout the text aid \r\n- understanding and relate concepts to real world applications\r\n- Updated and additional Matlab examples and exercises support use of computational tools in analysis and design\r\n- Available online teaching and learning tools include downloadable Matlab code, solutions manual, and image bank of figures from the book\r\n\r\nAbout the Author\r\nT.H.G. Megson is a professor emeritus with the Department of Civil Engineering at Leeds University (UK). For Elsevier he has written the market leading Butterworth Heinemann textbooks Aircraft Structures for Engineering \r\nStudents and Introduction to Aircraft Structural Analysis (a briefer derivative of the aircraft structures book), as well as the text/ref hybrid Structural and Stress Analysis.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\nPreface\r\nPart A: Fundamentals of Structural Analysis\r\nSection A1: Elasticity\r\nSection A2: Virtual work, energy, and matrix methods\r\nSection A3: Thin plate theory\r\nSection A4: Structural instability\r\nSection A5: Vibration of structures\r\nPart B: Analysis of Aircraft Structures\r\nSection B1: Principles of stressed skin construction\r\nSection B2: Airworthiness and airframe loads\r\nSection B3: Bending, shear and torsion of thin-walled beams\r\nSection B4: Stress analysis of aircraft components\r\nSection B5: Structural and loading discontinuities\r\nSection B6: Introduction to aeroelasticity\r\nAppendix: Design of a rear fuselage\r\nAppendix: Design of a rear fuselage\r\n <a href=\"\nhttps://s26.postimg.org/lqgqeq8x5/Aircraft_Structures_for_Engineering_Students_6t.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://s26.postimg.org/lqgqeq8x5/Aircraft_Structures_for_Engineering_Students_6t.jpg</a>","last_updated":"2017-09-15T12:03:47.849Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:6eefb1683132cfee72d4810c6a2784f0d9c15c78","dn":"Aircraft Structures for Engineering Students (6th Ed)(gnv64)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"6eefb1683132cfee72d4810c6a2784f0d9c15c78","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,239,177,104,49,50,207,238,114,212,129,12,106,39,132,240,217,193,92,120]},"name":"Aircraft Structures for Engineering Students (6th Ed)(gnv64)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
