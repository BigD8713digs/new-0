It peaked at #24 on the Billboard 200, debuting at that position on April 2, 2005 with first week sales of 33,000 copies, and spending eight weeks on the chart. Its sales as of 2017 sit at over 640,000. The album was dedicated to Cass Elliot, with great thanks to Neil Young.\r\n\r\nAlthough &apos;Teach your Children&apos; and &apos;Carry On&apos; are on the Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young album D&#xE9;j&#xE0; Vu, Young wasn&apos;t involved in those songs, allowing this to authentically be considered specifically a &quot;Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash&quot; collection. The music selections derive from the group&apos;s first four studio albums: (Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash, D&#xE9;j&#xE0; Vu, CSN, and Daylight Again), but nothing from their last four: (American Dream, Live It Up, After the Storm, and Looking Forward).
