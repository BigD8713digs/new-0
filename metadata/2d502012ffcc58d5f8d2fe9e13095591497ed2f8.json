It was also, in time, judged by most historians to have been unnecessary; though it had been conceived to protect MacArthur&apos;s flank in the Philippines, the US fleet&apos;s carrier raids had eliminated Japanese airpower, rendering Peleliu irrelevant. Nevertheless, the horrifying number of casualties sustained there foreshadowed the rest of the war: Rather than fight to the death on the beach, the Japanese would now defend in depth and bleed the Americans white.\r\n\r\nDrawing extensively on personal interviews, the Marine Corps History Division&apos;s vast oral history and photographic collection, and many never-before-published sources, this book gives us a new and harrowing vision of what really happened at Peleliu - and what it meant. Working closely with two of the First Regiment&apos;s battalion commanders - Ray Davis and Russ Honsowetz - Marine Corps veteran and military historian Dick Camp recreates the battle as it was experienced by the men and their officers.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-06-17T12:10:46.146Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d502012ffcc58d5f8d2fe9e13095591497ed2f8","dn":"Last Man Standing by Dick Camp EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"2d502012ffcc58d5f8d2fe9e13095591497ed2f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,80,32,18,255,204,88,213,248,210,254,158,19,9,85,145,73,126,210,248]},"name":"Last Man Standing by Dick Camp EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
