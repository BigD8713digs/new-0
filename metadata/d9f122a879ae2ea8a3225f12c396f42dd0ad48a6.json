The recording quality is what you&apos;d expect of a 90s punk band. Still, the tracks are losslessly compressed FLACs - if there&apos;s someone out there who knows how to do proper noise reduction and equalisation to get these songs up to spec, I look forward to your torrent! For everyone else: you are encouraged to embrace the warm, friendly hiss of the tape.\r\n\r\nThe Possible Suspects were:\r\nEsther (drums)\r\nIwan (guitar)\r\nDick (guitar)\r\nWander (bass)\r\nMark (voice)\r\n\r\nMore info can be found in the included scan of the cassette&apos;s J-card, which, incidentally, lists the song &quot;Depression&quot; among the tracks, though it is not present on the tape.\r\n\r\n1 Alone in the Fight\r\n2 My Own D\r\n3 Exclosure of Humankind\r\n4 Read God&apos;s Word Everyday\r\n5 I Don&apos;t Wanna Be With You\r\n6 Complain","last_updated":"2018-06-14T12:14:41.640Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9f122a879ae2ea8a3225f12c396f42dd0ad48a6","dn":"Possible Suspect - Alone in the Fight (Punk, 1998) (FLAC)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"d9f122a879ae2ea8a3225f12c396f42dd0ad48a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,241,34,168,121,174,46,168,163,34,95,18,195,150,244,45,208,173,72,166]},"name":"Possible Suspect - Alone in the Fight (Punk, 1998) (FLAC)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
