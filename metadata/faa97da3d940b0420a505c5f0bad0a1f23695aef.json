As Islamic morality squads staged arbitrary raids in Tehran, fundamentalists seized hold of the universities, and a blind censor stifled artistic expression, the girls in Azar Nafisi&apos;s living room risked removing their veils and immersed themselves in the worlds of Jane Austen, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Henry James, and Vladimir Nabokov. In this extraordinary memoir, their stories become intertwined with the ones they are reading. Reading Lolita in Tehran is a remarkable exploration of resilience in the face of tyranny and a celebration of the liberating power of literature.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-07-14T12:00:45.107Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:faa97da3d940b0420a505c5f0bad0a1f23695aef","dn":"Reading Lolita in Tehran: A Memoir in Books by Azar Nafisi EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"faa97da3d940b0420a505c5f0bad0a1f23695aef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,169,125,163,217,64,176,66,10,80,92,95,11,173,10,31,35,105,90,239]},"name":"Reading Lolita in Tehran: A Memoir in Books by Azar Nafisi EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
