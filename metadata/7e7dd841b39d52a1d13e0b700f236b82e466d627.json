Verburgh EPUB\r\n\r\nMedical doctor and researcher Dr. Kris Verburgh is quickly emerging as one of the world&apos;s leading research authorities on the science of aging. The Longevity Code is his authoritative guide on why and how we age and on the four most crucial areas we have control over in order to slow down - and even reverse - the aging process.\r\n\r\nWe learn why some animal species hardly age at all while others age and die very quickly and about the mechanisms at work that slowly but definitely cause our bodies to age, making us susceptible to heart attack, stroke, cancer, pneumonia, and dementia.\r\n\r\nDr. Verburgh devotes the last third of The Longevity Code to what we can do to slow down the process of aging. He concludes by introducing and assessing the wide range of cutting-edge developments in anti-aging technology, the stuff once only of science fiction: new types of vaccines and the use of mitochondrial DNA, CRISPR proteins, stem cells, and more.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-02-08T12:01:21.408Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e7dd841b39d52a1d13e0b700f236b82e466d627","dn":"The Longevity Code: The New Science of Aging by K.
