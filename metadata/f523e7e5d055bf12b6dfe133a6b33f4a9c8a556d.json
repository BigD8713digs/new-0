He played the big Wurlitzer organ which is suspended from the roller rink&apos;s ceiling.  This organ is still played for skating today.\r\n\r\nHe also made strict-tempo organ music specifically for roller skating.  He played the Wurlitzer, a Rodgers 33E Theatre Organ, and a Hammond organ to make these in-tempo recordings.  After each selection&apos;s name is a metronome tempo designation which is used to determine which roller dances can be skated to that selection...i.e. (108 Waltz).\r\n\r\nIncluded in this collection are selections played on all three organs.\r\n\r\nThere are three LPs of session music in this collection: &apos;Big Band Jazz&apos;, &apos;A Session With Simmons&apos;, and &apos;Swingin&apos; Pipes&apos;.  \r\n\r\nSources are all vinyl discs...45 rpm for the in-tempo selections and the three 33 1/3 rpm discs for the session selections.  Quality varies, but all selections are very listenable","last_updated":"2017-08-08T12:04:44.017Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:f523e7e5d055bf12b6dfe133a6b33f4a9c8a556d","dn":"Don Simmons Organ Collection","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"f523e7e5d055bf12b6dfe133a6b33f4a9c8a556d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,35,231,229,208,85,191,18,182,223,225,51,166,179,63,74,156,138,85,109]},"name":"Don Simmons Organ Collection","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
