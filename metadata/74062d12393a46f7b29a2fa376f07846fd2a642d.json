The application uses a wizard style interface that can be navigated easily by users of all levels of expertise, whether they are beginners or experts.\r\n\r\nThe application&#x2019;s interface is both clean and intuitive. You can import music into the list by using either the file browser or drag and drop. In the list you can view the name, duration and status of each file. If you need to, you can also configure audio settings when it comes to bit rate, channels, codec, sample frequency and sample size. Then, all you need to do is specify the format, choose the destination folder and start the conversion process.\r\n\r\nKey features include:\r\n\r\nConvert between All Key Audio Formats.\r\nExport Audio from Video.\r\nConvert Files to M4B.\r\nCreate Ringtone for iPhone.\r\nEdit Your Audio Files.\r\nMultilingual Support\r\nIn addition to converting audio tracks, you can play, merge or trim files, insert gaps between songs, add cover art, grab from CDs, import audio from video, rename files, edit tag information, and configure renaming rules.\r\n\r\nOverall, AVS Audio Converter is a great tool that allows you to convert audio files between different formats and that offers a wizard-styled interface, which is easy to use. The downside is the the unregistered version is severely limited in functionality and it does use a large amount of system resources","last_updated":"2017-07-31T12:01:59.664Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:74062d12393a46f7b29a2fa376f07846fd2a642d","dn":"AVS Audio Converter 8.3.2.575 final   active","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"74062d12393a46f7b29a2fa376f07846fd2a642d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,6,45,18,57,58,70,247,178,154,47,163,118,240,120,70,253,42,100,45]},"name":"AVS Audio Converter 8.3.2.575 final   active","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
