But all that changed on one day.&apos;   \r\n\r\nThat day was September 11, 2001, when the global jihad struck America with murderous force. The United States of America and the free world were never the same again.   \r\n\r\nNeither was Pamela Geller.   \r\n\r\nIn this book, Geller shares how she launched her blogging career, defended abused Muslim girls, stood against the advance of sharia, and fought for the freedom of speech &#x2013; a freedom crumbling in this age of jihad.   \r\n\r\nGeller recounts the battle to defeat the sinister Ground Zero mosque project; the ISIS attack at Geller&apos;s Mohammed Art Exhibit and Cartoon Contest in Garland, Texas; the fatwa and plot to behead her; and the relentless vilification she faces from a mainstream media hell-bent on defaming and destroying everyone who stands for freedom against jihad terror and sharia oppression.   \r\n\r\nPamela Geller writes: &apos;Any lover of freedom would have been tarred the same way I was, and many have been. I am but a proxy in this terrible, long war. What has happened to me is what happens, in small and large ways, to every American who stands for freedom.&apos;   \r\n\r\nOne person can make a difference. And what a remarkable difference Pamela Geller has made. At last, in Fatwa: Hunted In America, she tells her story.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-01-01T12:00:18.976Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:983675ba7ddcb5b08a14bb75f7cbabd9e846005e","dn":"Fatwa_ Hunted in America by Pamela Geller EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"983675ba7ddcb5b08a14bb75f7cbabd9e846005e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,54,117,186,125,220,181,176,138,20,187,117,247,203,171,217,232,70,0,94]},"name":"Fatwa_ Hunted in America by Pamela Geller EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
