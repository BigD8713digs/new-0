The Tournament of Power planned by Zen-Oh begins, with multiple universes partaking&#x2014;with each universe having a team of 10 fighters who battle alongside each other. The arc will feature continuous debuts of elites from each universe. However, this also proves to be the beginning of universal destruction. If a team were to lose, then the universe they come from will be destroyed immediately.\r\n\r\nSeven years after the events of Dragon Ball Z, Earth is at peace, and its people live free from any dangers lurking in the universe. However, this peace is short-lived; a sleeping evil awakens in the dark reaches of the galaxy: Beerus, the ruthless God of Destruction.\r\n\r\nDisturbed by a prophecy that he will be defeated by a &#x201C;Super Saiyan God,&#x201D; Beerus and his angelic attendant Whis start searching the universe for this mysterious being. Before long, they reach Earth where they encounter Gokuu Son, one of the planet&#x2019;s mightiest warriors, and his similarly powerful friends.\r\nInformation\r\n\r\n    Type: TV\r\n    Episodes: 131\r\n    Status: Finished Airing\r\n    Aired: Jul 5, 2015 to Mar 25, 2018\r\n    Premiered: Summer 2015\r\n    Broadcast: Sundays at 09:00 (JST)\r\n    Producers: Yomiko Advertising, Fuji TV\r\n    Licensors: Funimation\r\n    Studios: Toei Animation\r\n    Source: Manga\r\n    Genres: Action, Adventure, Comedy, Super Power, Martial Arts, Fantasy, Shounen\r\n    Duration: 23 min.\r\n    Rating: PG-13 &#x2013; Teens 13 or older","last_updated":"2018-03-28T12:11:28.230Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:32dd8838bb99e731642fd795a3d74308cc3ddd3e","dn":"Dragon Ball Super 720p Eng Sub 10bit x265 (complete)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"32dd8838bb99e731642fd795a3d74308cc3ddd3e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,221,136,56,187,153,231,49,100,47,215,149,163,215,67,8,204,61,221,62]},"name":"Dragon Ball Super 720p Eng Sub 10bit x265 (complete)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
