The combination of Spring Boot, Spring Web MVC, Spring Web Services and JPA makes it even more fun.Architectures are moving towards microservices. RESTful web services are the first step to developing great microservices. Spring Boot, in combination with Spring Web MVC (also called Spring REST) makes it easy to develop RESTful web services.There are two parts to this course &#x2013; RESTful web services and SOAP Web Services.In the first part of the course, you will learn the basics of RESTful web services developing resources for a social media application. You will learn to implement these resources with multiple features &#x2013; versioning, exception handling, documentation (Swagger), basic authentication (Spring Security), filtering and HATEOAS. You will learn the best practices in designing RESTful web services.\r\n\r\nWho is the target audience?\r\n\r\n    You want to learn the basics of Web Services\r\n    You want to learn the terminology associated with Web Services\r\n    You want to learn to develop and design RESTful web services\r\n    You want to learn to develop and design SOAP web services\r\n    You have good experience with Java and want to see what more you can do with Java\r\n    You have good experience with Spring and want to use that knowledge\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n\r\n    You should have working experience with Java.\r\n    We will help you install Eclipse and get up and running with Maven and Tomcat.\r\n\r\nLast updated 4/2018","last_updated":"2018-07-20T12:11:04.080Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:bde70d2d91e40f4f3c652d0aefb1276ccc65ddab","dn":"Udemy Master Java Web Services and REST API with Spring Boot","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"bde70d2d91e40f4f3c652d0aefb1276ccc65ddab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,231,13,45,145,228,15,79,60,101,45,10,239,177,39,108,204,101,221,171]},"name":"Udemy Master Java Web Services and REST API with Spring Boot","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
