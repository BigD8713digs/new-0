Produced by Butch Vig, Nevermind was the band&apos;s first release on DGC. It was also their first album to feature drummer Dave Grohl.Nevermind became a surprise success in late 1991, largely due to the popularity of its first single, &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot;. The album also produced three other successful singles: &quot;Come as You Are&quot;, &quot;Lithium&quot;, and &quot;In Bloom&quot;. The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) has certified the album diamond (at least over 10 million copies shipped), and the album has sold at least 30 million copies worldwide, with 10,640,000 of those copies sold in the United States. Nevermind was in part responsible for bringing both alternative rock and grunge to a large, mainstream audience, and has been ranked highly on lists of the greatest albums of all time by publications such as Rolling Stone and Time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTrack List:\r\n\r\n1. \t&quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; \t5:01\r\n2. \t&quot;In Bloom&quot;           \t        4:14\r\n3. \t&quot;Come as You Are&quot; \t        3:39\r\n4. \t&quot;Breed&quot; \t                3:03\r\n5. \t&quot;Lithium&quot; \t                4:17\r\n6. \t&quot;Polly&quot; \t                2:57\r\n7. \t&quot;Territorial Pissings&quot;  \t2:22\r\n8. \t&quot;Drain You&quot; \t                3:43\r\n9. \t&quot;Lounge Act&quot; \t                2:36\r\n10. \t&quot;Stay Away&quot; \t                3:32\r\n11. \t&quot;On a Plain&quot; \t                3:16\r\n12. \t&quot;Something in the Way&quot; \t         3:46","last_updated":"2017-06-21T12:06:17.206Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd573a697ebe8a9f9e7c72b4300c1a819a62b098","dn":"Nirvana - Nevermind (1991) [FLAC]","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"fd573a697ebe8a9f9e7c72b4300c1a819a62b098","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,87,58,105,126,190,138,159,158,124,114,180,48,12,26,129,154,98,176,152]},"name":"Nirvana - Nevermind (1991) [FLAC]","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
