But Miss Clifton has met an untimely end - and Ursula is convinced it was not due to natural causes.\r\n\r\nArchaeologist and adventurer Slater Roxton thinks Mrs. Kern is off her head to meddle in such dangerous business. Nevertheless, he seems sensible enough to Ursula, though she does find herself unnerved by his self-possession and unreadable green-gold eyes. If this mysterious widowed beauty insists on stirring the pot, Slater intends to remain close by as they venture into the dark side of polite society.\r\n\r\nTogether they must reveal the identity of a killer - and to achieve their goal they may need to reveal their deepest secrets to each other as well.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-07-02T12:14:15.806Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f283947acbf4a3f3f5362a958f872562fc7e7ae","dn":"Garden of Lies by Amanda Quick EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"2f283947acbf4a3f3f5362a958f872562fc7e7ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,40,57,71,172,191,74,63,63,83,98,169,88,248,114,86,47,199,231,174]},"name":"Garden of Lies by Amanda Quick EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
