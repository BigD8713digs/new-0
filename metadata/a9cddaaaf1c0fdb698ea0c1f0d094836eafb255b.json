Do you want to pick off enemies one at a time like the killer in a slasher film? Dive into the thick of it and fight whole groups in a frontal assault? Steal the most powerful weapon you can find, and turn it on the rest?\r\n\r\nIf you die, there is never any load time; you can try again instantly! As your skills improve, you&apos;ll see that the game is not about winning. It&apos;s about experimenting to make the coolest action scenes that you can. Every design decision is made with that in mind, from the mouselook camera to the context-sensitive combat controls.\r\n\r\nAfter completing the story modes, you can try out all the mods that players have created with the integrated editor! If you want to play as a human character in a city, or try a whole new campaign, or even fly around as a bat, there&apos;s probably already a mod that makes that happen.\r\n\r\n\r\nSystem Requirements\r\n\r\nMinimum:\r\nOS: Windows XP or later\r\nProcessor: Passmark CPU 1000 or better\r\nMemory: 2 GB RAM\r\nGraphics: Passmark GPU 500 or better with OpenGL 3.2 support\r\nStorage: 17 GB available space\r\n\r\nHow to install\r\n\r\nAfter download is done:\r\n- open Overgrowth.Repack(executable file)\r\n- choose location ,\r\n- click install ,\r\n- wait until is done \r\n- play game from desktop shortcut \r\nor Run ...Overgrowth.exe from the game install path","last_updated":"2017-10-29T12:04:31.414Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9cddaaaf1c0fdb698ea0c1f0d094836eafb255b","dn":"Overgrowth.Repack","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"a9cddaaaf1c0fdb698ea0c1f0d094836eafb255b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,205,218,170,241,192,253,182,152,234,12,31,13,9,72,54,234,251,37,91]},"name":"Overgrowth.Repack","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
