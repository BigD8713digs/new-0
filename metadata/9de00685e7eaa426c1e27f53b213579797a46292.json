Kaufman, James C. Kaufman\r\nISBN-13: 9780262537049\r\nBOOK SPECS: https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/pseudoscience\r\nFILE SPECS: EPUB (reflowable) format, bookmarks, 2.3 MB\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION:  Case studies, personal accounts, and analysis show how to recognize and combat pseudoscience in a post-truth world.\r\n\r\nIn a post-truth, fake news world, we are particularly susceptible to the claims of pseudoscience. When emotions and opinions are more widely disseminated than scientific findings, and self-proclaimed experts get their expertise from Google, how can the average person distinguish real science from fake? This book examines pseudoscience from a variety of perspectives, through case studies, analysis, and personal accounts that show how to recognize pseudoscience, why it is so widely accepted, and how to advocate for real science.\r\n\r\nContributors examine the basics of pseudoscience, including issues of cognitive bias; the costs of pseudoscience, with accounts of naturopathy and logical fallacies in the anti-vaccination movement; perceptions of scientific soundness; the mainstream presence of &quot;integrative medicine&quot;, hypnosis, and parapsychology; and the use of case studies and new media in science advocacy.\r\n\r\nBRIEF CONTENTS:  too extensive to load here; cannot be read on the book&apos;s WEB page either (see BOOK SPECS above)","last_updated":"2018-10-11T12:30:39.409Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:9de00685e7eaa426c1e27f53b213579797a46292","dn":"Pseudoscience: The Conspiracy Against Science 2018 Kaufman EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"9de00685e7eaa426c1e27f53b213579797a46292","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,224,6,133,231,234,164,38,193,226,127,83,178,19,87,151,151,164,98,146]},"name":"Pseudoscience: The Conspiracy Against Science 2018 Kaufman EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
