Decades of unprecedented prosperity followed, memorably punctuated by riots, strikes, burning rivers, and oil embargoes. A vibrant, quintessentially American character bloomed in the region&apos;s cities, suburbs, and backwaters.\r\n\r\nBut the innovation and industry that defined the Rust Belt also helped to hasten its demise. An air conditioner invented in Upstate New York transformed the South from a sweaty backwoods to a non-unionized industrial competitor. Japan and Germany recovered from their defeat to build fuel-efficient cars in the stagnant 1970s. The tentpole factories that paid workers so well also filled the air with soot, and poisoned waters and soil. The jobs drifted elsewhere, and many of the people soon followed suit.\r\n\r\nNothin&apos; but Blue Skies tells the story of how the country&apos;s industrial heartland grew, boomed, bottomed, and hopes to be reborn. Through a propulsive blend of storytelling and reportage, celebrated writer Edward McClelland delivers the rise, fall, and revival of the Rust Belt and its people.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-06-16T12:02:43.372Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:be55de3d67584a423b87d9eadd5fffc249c7af4a","dn":"Nothin' But Blue Skies by Edward McClelland EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"be55de3d67584a423b87d9eadd5fffc249c7af4a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,85,222,61,103,88,74,66,59,135,217,234,221,95,255,194,73,199,175,74]},"name":"Nothin' But Blue Skies by Edward McClelland EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
