No one attended the concert of these 4 brothers.  Dave, Lance, Carson, &amp; Melvin.  After a near deadly car accident, these 4 brothers learned their instruments and played for no one.  Melvin on drums is in a wheelchair.  Dave on Bass, Carson on Keys, Lance on Guitars.  They all sing a bit.  Thanks for listening","last_updated":"2017-12-23T12:08:04.083Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:43dce152ca33a407edd0d2459ae6a35421b6d0d7","dn":"The Willsniffs - NOT DEAD!","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"43dce152ca33a407edd0d2459ae6a35421b6d0d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,220,225,82,202,51,164,7,237,208,210,69,154,230,163,84,33,182,208,215]},"name":"The Willsniffs - NOT DEAD!","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
