Levitt EPUB\r\n\r\nAvraham Bahar leaves debt-ridden and depressed Albania to seek a better life in, ironically, Stalinist Russia. A professional barber, he curries favor with the Communist regime, ultimately being invited to become Stalin&#x2019;s personal barber at the Kremlin, where he is entitled to live in a government house with other Soviet dignitaries. In the intrigue that follows, Avraham, now known as Razan, is not only barber to Stalin but also to the many Stalin look-alikes that the paranoid dictator circulates to thwart possible assassination attempts - including one from Razan himself.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-01-27T12:03:49.567Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:18a28141180a14c934bbc3e0e5f8ab091f0138d0","dn":"Stalin's Barber by Paul M.
