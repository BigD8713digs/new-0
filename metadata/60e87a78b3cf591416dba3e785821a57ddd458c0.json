It used to say things so I&apos;d fit in, to please my parents, to please my teachers. It used to tell the universe I was something I wasn&apos;t. It lied.\r\n\r\nIt never occurred to me that everyone else was lying too.\r\n\r\nFifteen-year-old Tess doesn&apos;t mean to become mute. At first, she&apos;s just too shocked to speak. And who wouldn&apos;t be? Discovering your whole life has been a lie because your dad isn&apos;t your real father is a pretty big deal. Terrified of the truth, Tess retreats into silence.\r\n\r\nReeling from her family&apos;s betrayal, Tess sets out to discover the identity of her real father. He could be anyone - even the familiar-looking teacher at her school. Tess continues to investigate, uncovering a secret that could ruin multiple lives. It all may be too much for Tess to handle, but how can she ask for help when she&apos;s forgotten how to use her voice?\r\n\r\nIn a brilliant study of identity, betrayal, and complex family dynamics, award-winning author Annabel Pitcher explores the importance of communication, even when we&apos;re faced with unspeakable truths.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-03-11T12:00:52.894Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:60e87a78b3cf591416dba3e785821a57ddd458c0","dn":"Silence Is Goldfish by Annabel Pitcher EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"60e87a78b3cf591416dba3e785821a57ddd458c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,232,122,120,179,207,89,20,22,219,163,231,133,130,26,87,221,212,88,192]},"name":"Silence Is Goldfish by Annabel Pitcher EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
