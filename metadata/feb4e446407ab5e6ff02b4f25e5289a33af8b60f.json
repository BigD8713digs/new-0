Now, with The Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana, Eco crafts another of the ambitious and breathtaking novels that are his trademark.\r\n\r\nWhen book dealer Yambo suffers amnesia, he loses all sense of who he is, but retains memories of all the books, poems, songs, and movies he has ever experienced. To reclaim his identity, he retreats to the family home and rummages through old letters, photographs, and mementos stored in the attic. Yambo&apos;s mind swirls with thoughts, and he struggles to retrieve the one memory that may be most sacred, that of Lila Saba, his first love.\r\n\r\nSteeped in nostalgia and filled with vivid, sometimes wondrous imagery, The Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana is a magnificent addition to Eco&apos;s literary legacy.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-07-21T12:00:43.302Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:feb4e446407ab5e6ff02b4f25e5289a33af8b60f","dn":"The Mysterious Flame of Queen Loan by Umberto Eco epub RtR","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"feb4e446407ab5e6ff02b4f25e5289a33af8b60f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,180,228,70,64,122,181,230,255,2,180,242,94,82,137,163,58,248,182,15]},"name":"The Mysterious Flame of Queen Loan by Umberto Eco epub RtR","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
