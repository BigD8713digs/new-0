The Montreal-born, New York-based singer-songwriter could easily be mistaken for Nick Drake&#x2019;s twin, Mark Kozelek&#x2019;s equal when it comes to vivid storytelling, and Jim James&#x2019; peer with respect to vocals that leave a lasting imprint. His 2014 self-titled album reflected all these element, as Marchant delivered one of the year&#x2019;s most enthralling and dazzling records. Fast forward four years and Marchant returns with another album, Illusion of Love, that is simply spellbinding, and it cements his status as one of music&#x2019;s most cinematic artists. \r\n&#x2026;Taking a cursory look at the list of contributors to this album, you might tend to attribute that to people who worked with Kevin Morby, Bob Weir, The War On Drugs, The National and so on. And yes, they certainly chip in their share. Just listen to the band cooly rampage to the more uptempo track here, the Springsteen-like &#x201C;Heart Of Mine,&#x201D; or even more so, the brilliant &#x201C;6 &amp; 5.&#x201D; \r\nBut then, nothing would probably have worked if Marchant himself didn&#x2019;t come up with some great songs and if he didn&#x2019;t have a singing voice that is a cross between Damien Jurado and Jim James. And he uses it to great advantage on cool ballads like the opener &#x201C;All These Kids I Never Knew&#x201D; or &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve Got Friends.&#x201D; And whoever did the string arrangements, like the one on &#x201C;In This Short Time,&#x201D; should definitely be given extra credit. \r\n\r\n\r\nTracklist: \r\n01 - All These Kids I Never Knew.flac \r\n02 - Heart of Mine.flac \r\n03 - Distance Is the Only Measure.flac \r\n04 - Sister, I.flac \r\n05 - 6&amp;5.flac \r\n06 - I&apos;ve Got Friends.flac \r\n07 - In This Short Time.flac \r\n08 - Frame for One.flac \r\n09 - Burning Red.flac \r\n10 - Nightships.flac \r\n11 - Owl in the Dark.flac \r\n12 - Illusion of Love.flac \r\n\r\nSummary: \r\nCountry: USA \r\nGenre: indie-folk, indie-rock","last_updated":"2018-05-05T12:05:38.277Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:769fbd661f6faa338ebb9822fc77ab3346cd3289","dn":"[indie-folk, indie-rock] (2018) Jesse Marchant - Illusion of Lov","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"769fbd661f6faa338ebb9822fc77ab3346cd3289","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,159,189,102,31,111,170,51,142,187,152,34,252,119,171,51,70,205,50,137]},"name":"[indie-folk, indie-rock] (2018) Jesse Marchant - Illusion of Lov","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
