Together, they create a kaleidoscopic picture of the rich and varied oral traditions that have shaped the culture and society of successive generations of Africans for thousands of years, throughout the long struggle to survive and explore this massive and environmentally diverse continent.\r\n\r\nStephen Belcher was born in Cairo, Egypt, and spent much of his childhood in Africa and Europe. He holds a doctorate in Comparative Literature from Brown University and has taught in the history department at Pennsylvania State University. He is the co-editor (with John W. Johnson and Thomas Hale) of Voices from a Vast Continent: Oral Epics from Africa, and the author of Epic Traditions of Africa.\r\n\r\nPaperback: 544 pages\r\nPublisher: Penguin Classics; 1st edition (June 27, 2006)","last_updated":"2017-12-30T12:00:50.953Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d0a2159613c8941fc7af75fbb61850e8724816e","dn":"African Myths of Origin (Penguin Classics)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"3d0a2159613c8941fc7af75fbb61850e8724816e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,10,33,89,97,60,137,65,252,122,247,95,187,97,133,14,135,36,129,110]},"name":"African Myths of Origin (Penguin Classics)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
