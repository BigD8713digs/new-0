Writings by the founders of classical mechanics, G. Galilei and I. Newton, are reproduced, encouraging students to consult them. Emphasis is also consistently placed on the experimental basis of the concepts, highlighting the experimental nature of physics. Whenever feasible at the elementary level, concepts relevant to more advanced courses in modern physics are included. Each chapter begins with an introduction that briefly describes the subjects to be discussed and ends with a summary of the main results. A number of &#x201C;Questions&#x201D; are included to help readers check their level of understanding. \r\n\r\n1. First volume covers the mechanics of point particles, gravitation, extended systems (starting from the two-body system), the basic concepts of relativistic mechanics and the mechanics of rigid bodies and fluids.\r\n2. Second volume covers the mechanics of fluids, the principles of thermodynamics and their applications (without reference to the microscopic structure of systems), and the microscopic interpretation of thermodynamics.\r\n3. Third volume covers the electric field under static conditions, constant electric currents and their laws, the magnetic field in a vacuum, electromagnetic induction, magnetic energy under static conditions, the magnetic properties of matter, and the unified description of electromagnetic phenomena provided by Maxwell&#x2019;s equations.\r\n4. Fourth volume of a four-volume textbook covers the oscillations of systems with one or more degrees of freedom; the concept of waves, focusing on light and sound; phase and group velocities, their physical meaning, and their measurement; diffraction and interference of light; polarization phenomena; and the formation of images in the eye and in optical instruments.\r\n <a href=\"\nhttps://s26.postimg.org/8vr5ryq1l/A_Course_in_Classical_Physics.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://s26.postimg.org/8vr5ryq1l/A_Course_in_Classical_Physics.jpg</a>","last_updated":"2017-09-02T12:01:07.018Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e5fa5addb6c61698641392b82cc5317956afffb","dn":"A Course in Classical Physics (4 Volumes)(gnv64)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"5e5fa5addb6c61698641392b82cc5317956afffb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,95,165,173,219,108,97,105,134,65,57,43,130,204,83,23,149,106,255,251]},"name":"A Course in Classical Physics (4 Volumes)(gnv64)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
