For devices not provided with standard Twain&#x2122; or WIA drivers, eMedia is able to check out the contents of the folder of the hard disk linked to the device.\r\n\r\neMedia can be expanded with plug-ins, and the edit process can be controlled by a third-party program or document, such as a Microsoft&#x2122; Excel&#x2122; Worksheet, a Microsoft&#x2122; Access&#x2122; application or an HTML page.\r\n\r\neMedia fully supports the CoolReader&#x2122; technology to display the card corresponding to the one read by a barcode reader, a magnetic strip reader or a Mifare card serial number. This can be useful for checking the card&#x2019;s holder.\r\n\r\nElements on the card can be automatically calculated, as eMedia incorporates an expression evaluator.\r\n\r\neMedia can print your card, encode the magnetic strips (ISO and non-ISO tracks 1, 2 and 3, JIS Type-II), encode the smart card and encode the contactless card in only one single operation. The card is printed in less than 30 seconds, allowing just-in-time printing","last_updated":"2017-08-31T12:03:39.009Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2319c5484d92e1f15b4aa72f8ea665f92be8f34","dn":"EVOLIS EMEDIA CARD PRINTING SOFTWARE PRO","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"a2319c5484d92e1f15b4aa72f8ea665f92be8f34","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,49,156,84,132,217,46,31,21,180,170,114,248,234,102,95,146,190,143,52]},"name":"EVOLIS EMEDIA CARD PRINTING SOFTWARE PRO","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
