It includes remixed versions of: The Yes Album (1971), Fragile (1971), Close To The Edge (1972), the double album Tales From Topographic Oceans (1973), and Relayer (1974). Each album features remixed audio by Steven Wilson, released on vinyl for the first time.\r\n\r\nThe record case features artwork created specifically for the set by Roger Dean, whose artwork and trademark calligraphy are synonymous with the band&#x2019;s identity; two of the albums, Close To The Edge and Tales From Topographic Oceans, have new cover art, while the remaining three covers have been reworked by Dean.\r\n\r\nAfter their initial release in the 1970&#x2019;s, Wilson&#x2019;s articulate remix shines a light on the stellar performances that run deep through each of these the albums, from hits like &#x201C;Roundabout&#x201D; and &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve Seen All Good People,&#x201D; to album-side length epics like &#x201C;Close To The Edge&#x201D; and &#x201C;The Gates Of Delirium.&#x201D; \r\n\r\nTracklist:\r\n\r\nThe Yes Album\r\nYours Is No Disgrace \t\r\nClap \t\r\nStarship Trooper \t\r\nA.
