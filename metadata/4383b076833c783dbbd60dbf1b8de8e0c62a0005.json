Kharkov became one of the most bitterly contested cities during the war on the Eastern Front, and this book presents a graphic overview of the atrocious conditions the soldiers on both sides had to endure.\r\n\r\nIn 1941 Kharkov fell to Hitler&#x2019;s Army Group South. In 1942 the Soviets tried and failed to retake it, losing 240,000 men in the Barvenkovo Bulge. Then, in 1943, the control of the battered city changed hands twice before the Soviets liberated it for good. The fate of Kharkov during the war reflects the history of the wider struggle between Hitler&#x2019;s Germany and Stalin&#x2019;s Soviet Union.\r\n\r\nAnthony Tucker-Jones is a former defence intelligence officer and a widely published expert on regional conflicts, counter-terrorism and armoured warfare. He is author of over twenty books including the Falaise: The Flawed Victory, Operation Dragoon: The Liberation of Southern France 1944, Armoured Warfare on the Eastern Front, The Kalashnikov in Combat, The Soviet-Afghan War, Tiger I &amp; Tiger II and T-34: The Red Army&apos;s Legendary Medium Tank.
