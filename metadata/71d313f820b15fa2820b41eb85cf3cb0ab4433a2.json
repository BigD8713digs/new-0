They&apos;re just rude. Coming in waves of rocket ships, the aliens not only refuse to acknowledge the existence of Earth&apos;s cultures. They refuse to acknowledge the existence of humanity itself. The aliens by means of their bulk block entry into cars, grocery stores, even elevators...without malice or even purpose. No one knows what it&apos;s like to be ignored by the aliens more than Craig Mencken, an amateur journalist who writes inane copy for a magazine tycoon. A pair of aliens have invaded his home, abused his furniture, and disrupted his life. Who thought first contact could be such a nuisance? But when Mencken&apos;s employer demands the story of the century, a fictional interview with an alien, the sinister truth about the invasion is accidentally revealed. Soon Mencken&apos;s ex-boyfriend is dropping hints about a mysterious cabal that promises to rid the aliens from neighborhoods like exterminators do with vermin. Then a narcissistic federal agent wants Mencken to spy on the cabal for the sake of his country. As if life weren&apos;t already hard enough, the &quot;dozers&quot;--cubic machines capable of demolishing skyscrapers in minutes--start landing across the globe, and it does not seem likely the aliens will ignore mankind for much longer.\r\n\r\nGenre: Fiction &gt; Sci-Fi, Aliens","last_updated":"2018-11-25T12:15:40.160Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:71d313f820b15fa2820b41eb85cf3cb0ab4433a2","dn":"The Survivors by Sean Eads (.epub)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"71d313f820b15fa2820b41eb85cf3cb0ab4433a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,211,19,248,32,177,95,162,130,11,65,235,133,207,60,176,171,68,51,162]},"name":"The Survivors by Sean Eads (.epub)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
