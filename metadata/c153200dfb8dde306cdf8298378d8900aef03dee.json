After many years writing a humorous television column in The Age, she moved on to regular political columns for ABC&apos;s The Drum and senior contributing work for Frankie magazine. In the guise of literary reviewer she makes Jennifer Byrne&apos;s life an unbridled misery once a month on ABC TV&apos;s First Tuesday Book Club.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-09-02T12:06:55.313Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:c153200dfb8dde306cdf8298378d8900aef03dee","dn":"You'll Be Sorry When I'm Dead by Marieke Hardy ePUB MOBI eBOOK-Z","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"c153200dfb8dde306cdf8298378d8900aef03dee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,83,32,13,251,141,222,48,108,223,130,152,55,141,137,0,174,240,61,238]},"name":"You'll Be Sorry When I'm Dead by Marieke Hardy ePUB MOBI eBOOK-Z","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
