D. Robb\r\nNarrated by: Susan Ericksen\r\nLength: 13 hrs and 2 mins \r\nSeries: In Death, Book 45\r\nUnabridged Audiobook | View Abridged\r\nRelease Date:09-05-17\r\nPublisher: Brilliance Audio\r\nA new novel in the #1 New York Times bestselling series: Lt. Eve Dallas must separate rumors from reality when a woman who traffics in other people&apos;s secrets is silenced.\r\nThe chic Manhattan nightspot Du Vin is not the kind of place Eve Dallas would usually patronize, and it&apos;s not the kind of bar where a lot of blood gets spilled. But that&apos;s exactly what happens one cold February evening.\r\nThe mortally wounded woman is Larinda Mars, a self-described &quot;social information reporter,&quot; or as most people would call it, a professional gossip. As it turns out, she was keeping the most shocking stories quiet, for profitable use in her side business as a blackmailer. Setting her sights on rich, prominent marks, she&apos;d find out what they most wanted to keep hidden and then bleed them dry. Now someone&apos;s done the same to her, literally - with a knife to the brachial artery.\r\nEve didn&apos;t like Larinda Mars. But she likes murder even less. To find justice for this victim, she&apos;ll have to plunge into the dirty little secrets of all the people Larinda Mars victimized herself. But along the way, she may be exposed to some information she really didn&apos;t want to know...\r\n&#xA9;2017 Nora Roberts (P)2017 Brilliance Publishing, Inc., all rights reserved","last_updated":"2017-09-20T12:10:35.615Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee8145c7d3e69449d1e6b7804d327526f5758e56","dn":"Secrets in Death audiobook by J D Robb [EarReaders]","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"ee8145c7d3e69449d1e6b7804d327526f5758e56","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,129,69,199,211,230,148,73,209,230,183,128,77,50,117,38,245,117,142,86]},"name":"Secrets in Death audiobook by J D Robb [EarReaders]","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
