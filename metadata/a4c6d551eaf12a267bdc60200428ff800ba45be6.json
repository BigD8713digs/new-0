He finally leaves for abroad to pursue his ambitions as an artist. The work is an early example of some of Joyce&apos;s modernist techniques that would later be represented in a more developed manner by Ulysses and Finnegans Wake. The novel, which has had a &quot;huge influence on novelists across the world&quot;, was ranked by Modern Library as the third greatest English-language novel of the 20th century.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-09-04T12:00:34.809Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4c6d551eaf12a267bdc60200428ff800ba45be6","dn":"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man by James Joyce ePUB PDF ","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"a4c6d551eaf12a267bdc60200428ff800ba45be6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,198,213,81,234,241,42,38,123,220,96,32,4,40,255,128,11,164,91,230]},"name":"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man by James Joyce ePUB PDF ","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
