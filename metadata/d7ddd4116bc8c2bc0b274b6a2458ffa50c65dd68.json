But when she chooses unknown magazine reporter Monique Grant for the job, no one in the journalism community is more astounded than Monique herself. Why her? Why now?\r\n\r\nMonique is not exactly on top of the world. Her husband, David, has left her, and her career has stagnated. Regardless of why Evelyn has chosen her to write her biography, Monique is determined to use this opportunity to jump-start her career.\r\n\r\nSummoned to Evelyn&apos;s Upper East Side apartment, Monique listens as Evelyn unfurls her story: from making her way to Los Angeles in the 1950s to her decision to leave show business in the late &apos;80s and, of course, the seven husbands along the way. As Evelyn&apos;s life unfolds - revealing a ruthless ambition, an unexpected friendship, and a great forbidden love - Monique begins to feel a very a real connection to the actress. But as Evelyn&apos;s story catches up with the present, it becomes clear that her life intersects with Monique&apos;s own in tragic and irreversible ways.\r\n\r\nWritten with Reid&apos;s signature talent for &quot;creating complex, likable characters&quot; (Real Simple), this is a fascinating journey through the splendor of Old Hollywood into the harsh realities of the present day as two women struggle with what it means - and what it takes - to face the truth.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-08-27T12:03:31.688Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:d7ddd4116bc8c2bc0b274b6a2458ffa50c65dd68","dn":"The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo by Taylor Jenkins Reid ePUB MO","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"d7ddd4116bc8c2bc0b274b6a2458ffa50c65dd68","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,221,212,17,107,200,194,188,11,39,75,106,36,88,255,165,12,101,221,104]},"name":"The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo by Taylor Jenkins Reid ePUB MO","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
