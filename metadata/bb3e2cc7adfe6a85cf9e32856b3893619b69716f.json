Bonenberger (Hanser, 2016).pdf\r\n\r\nThe systems-level knowledge and design skills needed to create good snap-fit interfaces existed in the minds of self-taught snap-fit experts but was not captured in the literature.\r\n \r\n New designers of plastic parts wishing to use snap-fit had nowhere to turn unless they were fortunate enough to have access to an experienced snap-fit designer. This book organizes and presents all design aspects of snap-fits with an emphasis on the systems level thinking required to create world-class attachments. Beginning, as well as experienced, product designers will find the information they need to develop snap-fits more efficiently and avoid many common snap-fit problems.\r\n \r\n The third edition has been thoroughly revised to include new case histories and applications. The text has been extensively rewritten for clarity and user-friendliness and there are many new figures with expert explanations","last_updated":"2017-06-11T12:05:01.858Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb3e2cc7adfe6a85cf9e32856b3893619b69716f","dn":"The First Snap-Fit Handbook 3rd ed - Paul R.
