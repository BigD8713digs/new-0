This collection of essays is written in the intimate, hilarious, and down-to-earth voice that made her novel, Someday, Someday, Maybe, a New York Times best seller.\r\n\r\n&quot;This book contains some stories from my life: the awkward growing up years, the confusing dating years, the fulfilling working years, and what it was like to be asked to play one of my favorite characters again. You probably think I&apos;m talking about my incredible achievement as Dolly in Hello, Dolly! as a Langley High School junior, a performance my dad called &apos;you&apos;re so much taller than the other kids.&apos; But no! I&apos;m talking about Lorelai Gilmore, who, back in 2008, I wasn&apos;t sure I&apos;d ever see again. Also included: tales of living on a houseboat, meeting guys at awards shows, and that time I was asked to be a butt model. A hint: all three made me seasick.&quot;\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-07-10T12:00:51.062Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:0feb530d9fd17c3d3d6ef8b4c426efb35125d43a","dn":"Lauren Graham - Talking as Fast as I Can 2016 RETAiL ePUB eBOOK-","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"0feb530d9fd17c3d3d6ef8b4c426efb35125d43a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,235,83,13,159,209,124,61,61,110,248,180,196,38,239,179,81,37,212,58]},"name":"Lauren Graham - Talking as Fast as I Can 2016 RETAiL ePUB eBOOK-","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
