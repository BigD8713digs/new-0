Candid, witty and revealing, this book takes its place beside the classic memoirs of Bob Dylan and Keith Richards.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-12-24T12:00:30.566Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:e619cc5bf4e8e7d5f1e69f8f5f60cfbdebd53903","dn":"Waging Heavy Peace by Neil Young EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"e619cc5bf4e8e7d5f1e69f8f5f60cfbdebd53903","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,25,204,91,244,232,231,213,241,230,159,143,95,96,207,189,235,213,57,3]},"name":"Waging Heavy Peace by Neil Young EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
