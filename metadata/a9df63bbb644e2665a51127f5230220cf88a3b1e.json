Readers will learn about the risks of breast cancer recurrence and interventions to reduce these, such as endocrine therapy and bisphosphonate therapy, as well as the role of lifestyle factors such as diet and exercise. The long-term effects of treatment on fertility, the heart and other systems are discussed, as well the  psychological burden for women who are increasingly likely to be cured from their cancer.  Each chapter provides background and a  practical guide in the management of women after the initial phase of diagnosis and treatment","last_updated":"2018-03-18T12:03:45.821Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9df63bbb644e2665a51127f5230220cf88a3b1e","dn":"Ring and  Parton (Eds) - Breast Cancer Survivorship (pdf)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"a9df63bbb644e2665a51127f5230220cf88a3b1e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,223,99,187,182,68,226,102,90,81,18,127,82,48,34,12,248,138,59,30]},"name":"Ring and  Parton (Eds) - Breast Cancer Survivorship (pdf)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
