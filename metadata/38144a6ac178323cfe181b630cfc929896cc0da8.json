Learn the basics fundamentals and programming techniques required for building fully functional Augmented Reality Apps. For this course you will need an Android Smartphone or iPhone.\r\nSo what is Augmented Reality?\r\nAccording to Wikipedia, Augmented reality (AR) is a live direct or indirect view of a physical, real-world environment whose elements are &#x201C;augmented&#x201D; by computer-generated or extracted real-world sensory input such as sound, video, graphics or GPS data.\r\nIn Augmented Reallity the real view is modified by a computer (Smartphone in this case). Augmented reality enhances one&#x2019;s current perception of reality, whereas in contrast, virtual reality replaces the real world with a simulated one. Augmentation techniques are basically performed in real time,\r\n\r\nWho is the target audience?\r\n    Computer programming students interested in C# programming for building Augmented Reality applications\r\n    Unity Developers interested in Augmented Reality platforms\r\n    Anyone who wants to develop their own AR Applications\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n    A Windows or Mac Computer system\r\n    Android SmartPhone or an iPhone\r\n    Basic programming knowledge will be of Great help","last_updated":"2018-07-07T12:07:02.175Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:38144a6ac178323cfe181b630cfc929896cc0da8","dn":"Build 11 Augmented Reality (AR) apps with Unity &amp; Vuforia","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"38144a6ac178323cfe181b630cfc929896cc0da8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,20,74,106,193,120,50,60,254,24,27,99,12,252,146,152,150,204,13,168]},"name":"Build 11 Augmented Reality (AR) apps with Unity &amp; Vuforia","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
