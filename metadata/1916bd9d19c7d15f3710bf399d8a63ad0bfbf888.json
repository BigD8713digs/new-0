Centered near Loma Prieta peak in the mountains south of San Jose, the quake killed 63 people and caused an estimated $10 billion in property loss. \r\n\r\nIt was the first large jolt in the region since the Great San Francisco Earthquake of 1906 (magnitude 7.8). Although the Loma Prieta earthquake struck on the periphery of the region&#x2013;more than 50 miles from San Francisco and Oakland&#x2013;it exposed the vulnerability of the region in future quakes, which will be larger and closer to its urban core. \r\n\r\nAnd analogkid was there in Oakland for the event. (Not this concert but the Quake) It was not fun but I was not bored either.\r\nBut thats a story for another time.... Were here to share this show from John Fogerty who lives in the Bay Area .(Berserkley)\r\n\r\nTracklist\r\n\r\n01. Born On The Bayou.mp3\r\n02. Green River.mp3\r\n03. Down On The Corner.mp3\r\n04.
