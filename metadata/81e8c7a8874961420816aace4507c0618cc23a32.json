It looks at how artisan cheese, craft beer, tattoos and beards evolve from being niche trends to hipster clich&#xE9;s. And asks why no hipster will ever, ever admit to being one. \r\n\r\nscreenshots <a href=\"\nhttps://extraimage.net/images/2017/12/18/1acebe9160a5d00fb138513c3d5400d5.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://extraimage.net/images/2017/12/18/1acebe9160a5d00fb138513c3d5400d5.jpg</a>","last_updated":"2017-12-18T12:02:05.142Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:81e8c7a8874961420816aace4507c0618cc23a32","dn":"Hipsters - Season 1 - 720p","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"81e8c7a8874961420816aace4507c0618cc23a32","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,232,199,168,135,73,97,66,8,22,170,206,69,7,192,97,140,194,58,50]},"name":"Hipsters - Season 1 - 720p","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
