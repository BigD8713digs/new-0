Good it will always be perfect. It is what it is.\r\n\r\nThe 1970s were Rory Gallagher&apos;s most prolific period. He produced ten albums in that decade, including two live albums, Live in Europe and Irish Tour &apos;74. November 1971 saw the release of the album Deuce. In the same year he was voted Melody Maker&apos;s International\r\nTop Guitarist of the Year, ahead of Eric Clapton.\r\n\r\nHowever, despite a number of his albums from this period reaching the UK Albums Chart, Gallagher died of complications in 1995 in London, UK at the age of 47.\r\nGallagher did not attain major star status\r\n\r\nOf course not. Most greatness is not discovered until the left side of death.\r\nGo figure....\r\n\r\nTracklist Disk 1\r\n\r\n01. Shin Kicker.mp3\r\n02. Do You Read Me.mp3\r\n03. Bought and Sold.mp3\r\n04.
