His name is Jho Low, a man whose behavior was so preposterous he might seem made up.\r\n\r\nAn epic true-tale of hubris and greed, Billion Dollar Whale reveals how this young social climber pulled off one of the biggest heists in history &#x2014; right under the nose of the global financial industry. Federal agents who helped unravel Bernie Madoff&#x2019;s Ponzi scheme say the 1MDB affair will become the textbook case of financial fraud in the modern age &#x2014; and its fallout is already being credited for taking down the prime minister of Malaysia.\r\n\r\nGenre: Non-Fiction &gt; General","last_updated":"2018-09-19T13:01:59.849Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:60e2b2be21af21ffb1ab11082809bd9323adac49","dn":"Billion Dollar Whale by Tom Wright &amp; Bradley Hope (.epub)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"60e2b2be21af21ffb1ab11082809bd9323adac49","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,226,178,190,33,175,33,255,177,171,17,8,40,9,189,147,35,173,172,73]},"name":"Billion Dollar Whale by Tom Wright &amp; Bradley Hope (.epub)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
