Her husband died years ago, as did his wife, and in such a small town they naturally have known of each other for decades; in fact, Addie was quite fond of Louis&apos;s wife. His daughter lives hours away in Colorado Springs, her son even farther away in Grand Junction, and Addie and Louis have long been living alone in houses now empty of family, the nights so terribly lonely, especially with no one to talk with.\r\n\r\nTheir brave adventures - their pleasures and their difficulties - are hugely involving and truly resonant, making Our Souls at Night the perfect final installment to this beloved writer&apos;s enduring contribution to American literature.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-06-04T12:14:36.316Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:64338fe54ceb55e5bccc6febe900da25f226df46","dn":"Our Souls at Night by Kent Haruf EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"64338fe54ceb55e5bccc6febe900da25f226df46","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,51,143,229,76,235,85,229,188,204,111,235,233,0,218,37,242,38,223,70]},"name":"Our Souls at Night by Kent Haruf EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
