Based around singer Derek Discanio&apos;s wailing vocals, the band was filled out by guitarists Tyler Szalkowski and Tony Diaz, and bassist William Goodermote; they were eventually joined by drummer Evan Ambrosio. After a demo circulated, the band released the Overslept EP in late 2012, and followed with full-length The Finer Things in 2013. An acoustic revamp of The Finer Things -- The Acoustic Things EP -- was released in late 2014. A year later, the band released their second LP, Around the World and Back, on Pure Noise Records. The album would prove to be somewhat of a breakout for State Champs, reaching number 30 on Billboard&apos;s Top 200 and laying the foundation for two years of hard touring. They issued a deluxe version of the same album with a DVD and a number of bonus songs in early 2017. A third full-length, Living Proof, arrived in 2018 and included the single &quot;Dead and Gone.&quot;","last_updated":"2018-06-17T12:06:11.850Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:22303f466422eccd2aafb48d50498ad6e39323c0","dn":"State Champs - Living Proof (2018) [16.44 FLAC]","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"22303f466422eccd2aafb48d50498ad6e39323c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,48,63,70,100,34,236,205,42,175,180,141,80,73,138,214,227,147,35,192]},"name":"State Champs - Living Proof (2018) [16.44 FLAC]","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
