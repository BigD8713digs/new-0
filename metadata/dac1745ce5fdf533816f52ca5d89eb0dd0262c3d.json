Assuming no knowledge of programming, this book starts with programming concepts, such as variables, assignments, and selection statements, moves on to loops, and then solves problems using both the programming concept and the power of MATLAB. The fifth edition has been updated to reflect the functionality of the current version of MATLAB (R2018a), including the addition of local functions in scripts, the new string type, coverage of recently introduced functions to import data from web sites, and updates to the Live Editor and App Designer.\r\n\r\nBRIEF CONTENTS:\r\n---------------\r\nPART I  Introduction to Programming Using MATLAB\r\n 1.
