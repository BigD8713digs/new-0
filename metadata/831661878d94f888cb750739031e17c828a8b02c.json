Imagine a technology that could provide those life-saving transplant organs for a nominal fee...and imagine what a company would do to get a monopoly on that technology.\r\n\r\nOn a remote island in the Canadian Arctic, P. J. Colding leads a group of geneticists who have discovered this holy grail of medicine. By reverse-engineering the genomes of thousands of mammals, Colding&apos;s team has dialed back the evolutionary clock to re-create humankind&#x2019;s common ancestor. The method? Illegal. The result? A computer-engineered living creature, an animal whose organs can be implanted in any person, and with no chance of transplant rejection.\r\n\r\nThere&apos;s just one problem: these ancestors are not the docile herd animals that Colding&apos;s team envisioned. Instead, Colding&#x2019;s work has given birth to something big, something evil.\r\n\r\nWith these killer creatures on the prowl, Colding and the woman he loves must fight to survive &#x2014; even as government agents close in to shut the project down, and the deep-pocketed company backing this research proves to have its own cold-blooded agenda.\r\n\r\nAs the creators become the prey in the ultimate battle for survival, Scott Sigler takes readers on the ultimate thrill-ride&#x2014;and offers a chilling cautionary account of what can happen when hubris, greed, and madness drive scientific experimentation past the brink of reason.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-07-15T12:00:34.409Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:831661878d94f888cb750739031e17c828a8b02c","dn":"Ancestor by Scott Sigler epub RtR","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"831661878d94f888cb750739031e17c828a8b02c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,22,97,135,141,148,248,136,203,117,7,57,3,30,23,200,40,168,176,44]},"name":"Ancestor by Scott Sigler epub RtR","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
