It was in this time of crisis that the modern kingdoms of Britain were born. In their responses to the Viking threat, these kingdoms forged their identities as hybrid cultures: vibrant and entrepreneurial peoples adapting to instability and opportunity. \r\n\r\nTraditionally, Alfred the Great is cast as the central player in the story of Viking Age Britain. But Max Adams, while stressing the genius of Alfred as war leader, law-giver, and forger of the English nation, has a more nuanced narrative approach to this conventional version of history. The Britain encountered by the Scandinavians of the ninth and tenth centuries was one of regional diversity and self-conscious cultural identities, depicted in glorious narrative fashion in The Viking Wars","last_updated":"2018-09-08T12:24:56.235Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:ebb2517d2dfe19b94d952053dcd7773ef0ba98ee","dn":"The Viking Wars by Max Adams (.epub)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"ebb2517d2dfe19b94d952053dcd7773ef0ba98ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,178,81,125,45,254,25,185,77,149,32,83,220,215,119,62,240,186,152,238]},"name":"The Viking Wars by Max Adams (.epub)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
