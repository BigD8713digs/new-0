To her surprise, the village of Balfour already feels like home, and her new business partner, Grant MacEwan, continues to be too charming to resist. But Abi has a history of relationship disasters, so she struggles to avoid an ill-fated romance with Grant. \r\n\r\nSteering clear is hard enough on a day-to-day basis, but when the two head off to a whisky industry competition together, Abi panics. Five-star resort, four glorious days of nonstop whisky tasting, and a fatally attractive Scotsman - what could possibly go wrong? \r\n\r\nThe night before the award presentations, with foreign and domestic whisky makers at one another&apos;s throats, two judges are found dead under mysterious circumstances. What started with three dream-come-true nominations for Abby Glen&#x2019;s whisky soon turns into a nightmare for Abi. \r\n\r\nWith a killer on the loose, she must call on her investigative skills to stop another murder - before she gets taken out of the running herself. \r\n\r\nMelinda Mullet&#x2019;s delightful Whisky Business mysteries can be read together or separately.
