Application of theory to practice is explained at each stage, helping operators understand associated implications in each unit process. Covers the theory and formulae for unit capacities and power requirements to help the designer develop the necessary equipment and flow-sheets to economically attain maximum yield and grade.\r\n\r\nThis second edition describes theories and practices of design and operation of apparatus and equipment, including an additional chapter on magnetic, electrostatic, and conductivity modes of mineral separation. Basics of process controls for efficient and economic modes of separation are introduced.\r\n\r\nOutlines the theory and practice in the design of flow sheets and operation of an integrated mineral processing plant\r\nIntroduces the basic magnetism, electrostatic, conductivity, and dielectrophoresis properties of minerals and related separation techniques\r\nDescribes automation in mineral processing plants allowing maximum yields and consistent high concentrate grades\r\nOutlines problems and offers solutions in the form of various examples","last_updated":"2017-06-08T12:02:49.684Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e5a3ce6a6b0cdba7ec7407dd21596d1b7233eb6","dn":"Mineral Processing Design and Operations - An Introduction 2nd e","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"4e5a3ce6a6b0cdba7ec7407dd21596d1b7233eb6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,90,60,230,166,176,205,186,126,199,64,125,210,21,150,209,183,35,62,182]},"name":"Mineral Processing Design and Operations - An Introduction 2nd e","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
