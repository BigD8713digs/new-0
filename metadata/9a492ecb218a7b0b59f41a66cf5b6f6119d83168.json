Fans of Young America Films know that, despite being heavily anti-Commie, they somehow feel like the grayest, bleakest Soviet shorts ever made. So, perfect for the holidays! Wash down that weird cranberry salad nobody actually likes with a tall glass of fear, shame, and forced conformity!\r\n\r\nThe short focuses on a family that, despite living in a large, well-furnished house, cannot afford a turkey for Thanksgiving. Did turkeys cost more than houses in the 50s? The only reasonable conclusion is: yes. The family patriarch makes everyone list all the things they&#x2019;re thankful for, to take their minds off his failure as a provider. And it&#x2019;s a sweet list: family, shelter, security&#x2026; and freedom from shadowy &#x201C;political gangsters dragging people off to jail.&#x201D; That&#x2019;s right, political gangsters. Man, if I had a dime for every Thanksgiving that got ruined by some of those political gangsters showing up and making a muck of things. They don&#x2019;t even bring wine!\r\n\r\nA Day of Thanksgiving is good for any day, including Thanksgiving. Join Mike, Kevin, and Bill at the table, and help fight fear with fear!\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIf you like this, send them a buck.\r\n\r\nrifftrax . com","last_updated":"2017-06-11T12:05:21.646Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a492ecb218a7b0b59f41a66cf5b6f6119d83168","dn":"RiffTrax Shorts - A Day Of Thanksgiving","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"9a492ecb218a7b0b59f41a66cf5b6f6119d83168","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,73,46,203,33,138,123,11,89,244,26,102,207,91,111,97,25,216,49,104]},"name":"RiffTrax Shorts - A Day Of Thanksgiving","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
