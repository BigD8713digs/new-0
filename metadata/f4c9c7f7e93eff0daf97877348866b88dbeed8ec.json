He doesn&#x2019;t have to think about it for long. With his brother Gijs van Hall (Jacob Derwig), he comes up with a risky plan to take out huge loans and use the money to finance the resistance. When this proves not enough, the brothers set about committing the biggest banking fraud in Dutch history, taking tens of millions of guilders out of the Dutch Central Bank &#x2013; right under the noses of the Nazis. But the bigger the operation gets, the more people it involves. And every day brings a bigger risk of someone making that one mistake that could put an end to the whole business &#x2013; and the lives of the resistance bankers.\n \n COVER <a href=\" https://imgmak.com/image/ZTm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\"> https://imgmak.com/image/ZTm</a>\n \n MEDIAINFO\n Container = Matroska (mkv)\n Duration = 02:03:26.624\n Filesize = 3 GiB\n --Video\n Codec info = AVC Main@L4 | V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\n Resolution = 1920x1080\n Display AR = 1.778 | 16:9\n Bitrate = 3 320 kb/s\n Framerate = CFR 24.000\n Color space = YUV\n Chroma subsampling = 4:2:0\n Encoder = x264 - core 148 r2715 7e75228\n --Audio\n Codec info = E-AC-3 | A_EAC3\n Channels = 6\n Bitrate = CBR 640 kb/s\n Samplerate = 48.0 kHz\n Language = English\n \n SCREENS\n  <a href=\" https://imgmak.com/image/ZTu\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\"> https://imgmak.com/image/ZTu</a>\n \n  <a href=\" https://imgmak.com/image/ZT5\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\"> https://imgmak.com/image/ZT5</a>\n \n  <a href=\" https://imgmak.com/image/ZT1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\"> https://imgmak.com/image/ZT1</a>\n \n  <a href=\" https://imgmak.com/image/ZTU\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\"> https://imgmak.com/image/ZTU</a>\n \n  <a href=\" https://imgmak.com/image/ZT3\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\"> https://imgmak.com/image/ZT3</a>\n \n  <a href=\" https://imgmak.com/image/ZTG\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\"> https://imgmak.com/image/ZTG</a>","last_updated":"2018-09-11T12:05:49.411Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:f4c9c7f7e93eff0daf97877348866b88dbeed8ec","dn":"The.Resistance.Banker.2018.1080p.NF.WEB-DL.DD 5.1.H264-CMRG[TGx]","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"f4c9c7f7e93eff0daf97877348866b88dbeed8ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,201,199,247,233,62,255,13,175,151,135,115,72,134,107,136,219,238,216,236]},"name":"The.Resistance.Banker.2018.1080p.NF.WEB-DL.DD 5.1.H264-CMRG[TGx]","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
