Not those... I mean these: &quot;knock me up.&quot;\r\n\r\nThis single gal has had enough of the games, the BS, and the endless chase. I know what I want most, and it&apos;s not true love. It&apos;s a bun in the oven, and I&apos;m not afraid to hit up my sex-on-a-stick coworker to do the job. Ryder is gorgeous, witty, and wild - and he&apos;s also a notorious commitmentphobe. That makes him the perfect candidate to make a deposit in the bank of me. I won&apos;t fall for him, he won&apos;t fall for me, and there&apos;s no way baby will make three. Right?\r\n\r\nThere are four words every guy wants to hear on the first date: &quot;your place or mine?&quot;\r\n\r\nWhen my hot-as-sin coworker makes me a no-strings-attached offer that involves her place, my place, any place - as well as any position - I can&apos;t refuse. Besides, I&apos;ve got my reasons to take her up on her deal even with her one big condition.\r\n\r\nThere&apos;s no way I&apos;ll want more from one woman than any position, anywhere, any night. Except...what if I do?\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-07-17T12:00:54.481Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:3820ac30ead7c4954ca78ce7c0e692e672ea644e","dn":"The Knocked Up Plan by Lauren Blakely ePUB eBOOK-ZAK","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"3820ac30ead7c4954ca78ce7c0e692e672ea644e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,32,172,48,234,215,196,149,76,167,140,231,192,230,146,230,114,234,100,78]},"name":"The Knocked Up Plan by Lauren Blakely ePUB eBOOK-ZAK","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
