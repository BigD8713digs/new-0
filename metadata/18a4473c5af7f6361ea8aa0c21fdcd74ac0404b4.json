Now Paul&apos;s story is told by rock music&apos;s foremost biographer, with McCartney&apos;s consent and access to family members and close friends who have never spoken on the record before.\r\n\r\nPaul McCartney: The Life reveals the complex character behind the fa&#xE7;ade and sheds new light on his childhood - blighted by his mother&apos;s death but redeemed by the father who introduced him to music. This is the first definitive account of Paul&apos;s often troubled partnership with John Lennon, his personal trauma after the Beatles&apos; breakup, and his subsequent struggle to get back to the top with Wings - which nearly got him murdered in Africa and brought him nine days in a Tokyo jail.\r\n\r\nReaders will learn about his marriage to Linda, including their much-criticized musical collaboration, and a moving account of her death. Packed with new information and critical insights, Paul McCartney: The Life will be the definitive biography of a musical legend.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-01-23T12:00:29.643Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:18a4473c5af7f6361ea8aa0c21fdcd74ac0404b4","dn":"Paul McCartney_ The Life by Philip Norman EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"18a4473c5af7f6361ea8aa0c21fdcd74ac0404b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,164,71,60,90,247,246,54,30,168,170,12,33,253,205,116,172,4,4,180]},"name":"Paul McCartney_ The Life by Philip Norman EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
