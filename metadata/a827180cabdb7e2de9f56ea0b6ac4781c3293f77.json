Adiyogi is symbol and myth, historic figure and living presence, creator and destroyer, outlaw and ascetic, cosmic dancer and passionate lover, all at once.\r\n\r\nA book like no other, this extraordinary document is a tribute to Shiva, the Adiyogi, by a living yogi; a chronicle of the progenitor of mysticism by a contemporary mystic. Here science and philosophy merge seamlessly, so do silence and sound, question and answer--to capture the unspeakable enigma of Adiyogi in a spellbinding wave of words and ideas that will leave one entranced, transformed.\r\n\r\n\r\nPaperback: 232 pages\r\nPublisher: Harper Element; 2017 edition (24 February 2017)\r\nLanguage: English\r\nISBN-10: 9352643925\r\nISBN-13: 978-9352643929","last_updated":"2017-06-21T12:00:34.229Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:a827180cabdb7e2de9f56ea0b6ac4781c3293f77","dn":"Sadhguru - Adiyogi_The Source of Yoga - 2017.epub","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"a827180cabdb7e2de9f56ea0b6ac4781c3293f77","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,39,24,12,171,219,126,45,233,245,110,160,182,172,71,129,195,41,63,119]},"name":"Sadhguru - Adiyogi_The Source of Yoga - 2017.epub","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
