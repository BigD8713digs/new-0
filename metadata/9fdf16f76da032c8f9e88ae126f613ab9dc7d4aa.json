How did a regime founded upon notions of its own racial superiority come to welcome hundreds of thousands of foreigners into its military elite - and what motivated these men? Following the sell-out success of his first volume in this series, Hitler&apos;s Gauls, the author examines in depth the Langemarck division, composed entirely of fighers drawn from the Flemish lands of Northern Belgium. Motivated by a powerful anti-communist zeal and a desire to escape forever the interference of their traditional enemy, France, these men fought at Stalingrd and in the encircling battles of the Volkhov pocket. \r\n\r\nGenre: Non-Fiction &gt; History","last_updated":"2018-09-29T13:26:25.805Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:9fdf16f76da032c8f9e88ae126f613ab9dc7d4aa","dn":"Hitler's Flemish Lions by Jonathan Trigg (.mobi)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"9fdf16f76da032c8f9e88ae126f613ab9dc7d4aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,223,22,247,109,160,50,200,249,232,138,225,38,246,19,171,157,199,212,170]},"name":"Hitler's Flemish Lions by Jonathan Trigg (.mobi)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
