Deeply ambivalent about growing up black in the lone star state, he was the first in his family to get as far away from Texas as he could. Until duty called him home.\r\n\r\nWhen his allegiance to his roots puts his job in jeopardy, he travels up Highway 59 to the small town of Lark, where two murders--a black lawyer from Chicago and a local white woman--have stirred up a hornet&apos;s nest of resentment. Darren must solve the crimes--and save himself in the process--before Lark&apos;s long-simmering racial fault lines erupt.\r\n\r\nA rural noir suffused with the unique music, color, and nuance of East Texas, Bluebird, Bluebird is an exhilarating, timely novel about the collision of race and justice in America","last_updated":"2018-01-06T12:02:27.526Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:c1543a21b5ffadc5de084bfc307c86330bf15c69","dn":"Attica Locke - Bluebird, Bluebird (epub)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"c1543a21b5ffadc5de084bfc307c86330bf15c69","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,84,58,33,181,255,173,197,222,8,75,252,48,124,134,51,11,241,92,105]},"name":"Attica Locke - Bluebird, Bluebird (epub)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
