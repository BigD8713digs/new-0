Though Aberdeen signed on the label in 1993 and Sarah Records stopped in August 1995, they released two singles Byron and Fireworks in that time period. \r\nAfter the label ended Aberdeen continued to record, releasing their debut album Homesick and Happy to Be Here via The Tremolo Arm Users Club. \r\nAfter initial success, it wasn&#x2019;t until 2008 and the release of What Do I Wish for Now, that the band started making ripples in the world of music once more. Another reunion followed in 2011 however as is so often the case, after 20 years, things sometimes just aren&#x2019;t the same. \r\nAnd so to 2015 and the release of It Was the Rain. John Girgus, co-founder of Aberdeen has been carrying a box of tapes around for quite a while. It was only a matter of time before he would finally reveal the definite sound of Aberdeen. Yes, the coveted first recordings: &#x2018;I&#x2019;ve been carrying around this box of tapes for 20 years now. This was always work that meant a lot to me. It was how I learned to write and record. More than Aberdeen being a band who would meet, rehearse, play, record; it was me with a guitar, a drum machine and a 4 track recorder. I&#x2019;d record ideas a few times, and as songs developed, I&#x2019;d give tapes to Beth who was living in LA at the time, and we&#x2019;d record on visits&#x2019;. \r\nThe release features 18 tracks including two versions of The Pastels Baby Honey as well as never released songs such as Bilinda. It&#x2019;s a must-have record as it completes Aberdeen. Included is hit single Sink Or Float, early Sarah recordings such as Byron, Fireworks and When It Doesn&#x2019;t Matter. \r\n \r\n\r\nTracklist: \r\n01. Bilinda.flac \r\n02.
