Her late father made his career as an ironworker on the Golden Gate Bridge, and the many stories of him trying to save jumpers still haunt her. When she&apos;s asked to write a history about the bridge, her research uncovers a secret journal hidden in her father&apos;s desk, pages of familiar advice penned by the hand of a stranger. The scribbled words tell of a promise ring and a distant love, clues that Katie hopes may answer her own unresolved sorrow.\r\n\r\nAcross the country, Dave Riley, a marketing executive in New York, encounters sorrows of his own. As he grasps at straws after tragedy strikes his family, a once whimsical daydream quickly turns into an obsession: he must ride his motorcycle across the Golden Gate Bridge on the Fourth of July.\r\n\r\nDoes the bridge hold answers for both Katie and Dave? Or will it only add to their heartache? The puzzling words left behind in a long-forgotten journal hold the key to the truth that they will discover on The Other Side of the Bridge.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-03-27T12:03:36.949Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b70fd3fff67ab9eba7c3821ab87d63f7915bc20","dn":"The Other Side of the Bridge by Cameron Wright EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"8b70fd3fff67ab9eba7c3821ab87d63f7915bc20","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,112,253,63,255,103,171,158,186,124,56,33,171,135,214,63,121,21,188,32]},"name":"The Other Side of the Bridge by Cameron Wright EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
