Spitzer  epub/mobi\r\nISBN-10: 158617956X, 320 pages\r\n\r\nOne of the hottest topics in contemporary culture is happiness&#x2014;so much so that the United Nations declared an International Happiness Day in response to the immense popularity of Pharrell Williams&#x2019; song &#x201C;Happy&#x201D;. The explanation for this current fixation seems to lie in the contrary phenomenon&#x2014;unhappiness. Despite the fact that we have tremendous access to every imaginable form of entertainment, we experience a pervading sense of insecurity, emptiness, and malaise amid sporadic peak experiences.\r\nThe problem seems to lie less in the external environment than in the internal one. We seem, in the words of Viktor Frankl, to be suffering from an absence of meaning that pervades both individuals and societies, giving rise to a collective emptiness, loneliness, and alienation.\r\nFinding True Happiness attempts to provide a way out of this personal and cultural vacuum by helping people to identify and then reach for happiness. As Aristotle noted 2,400 years ago, happiness is the one thing we can choose for its own sake&#x2014;everything else is chosen for the sake of happiness.\r\n\r\nPlease seed.
