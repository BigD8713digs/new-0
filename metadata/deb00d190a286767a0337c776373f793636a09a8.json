As if overnight, many Democrats revolted and passionately backed a socialist named Bernie Sanders; the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union; the vituperative billionaire Donald Trump became the presidential nominee of the Republican party; and a slew of rebellious parties continued to win elections in Switzerland, Norway, Italy, Austria, and Greece.\r\n\r\nJohn B. Judis, one of America&apos;s most respected political analysts, tells us why we need to learn about the populist movement that began in the United States in the 1890s, the politics of which have recurred on both sides of the Atlantic ever since. Populism, on both the right and the left, champions the people against an establishment, based on issues - globalization, free trade, immigration - on which there has been a strong elite consensus, but also a strong mass discontent that is now breaking out into the open.\r\n\r\nThe Populist Explosion is essential reading for our times as we grapple to understand the political forces at work here and in Europe.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-08-21T12:00:33.435Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:deb00d190a286767a0337c776373f793636a09a8","dn":"The Populist Explosion by John B Judis 2016 RETAiL ePUB eBOOK-Di","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"deb00d190a286767a0337c776373f793636a09a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,176,13,25,10,40,103,103,160,51,124,119,99,115,247,147,99,106,9,168]},"name":"The Populist Explosion by John B Judis 2016 RETAiL ePUB eBOOK-Di","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
