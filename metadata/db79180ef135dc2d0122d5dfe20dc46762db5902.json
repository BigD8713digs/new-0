She recycles. She&apos;s against racism. She&apos;s a good doctor, a good mom, a good wife...well, maybe not that last one, considering she&apos;s having an affair and has just requested a divorce via cell phone. But who could blame her? For years her husband&apos;s been selfish, sarcastic, and underemployed, writing the &quot;Angriest Man in Holloway&quot; column for their local paper.\r\n\r\nBut now David&apos;s changed. He&apos;s become a good person, too, really good. He&apos;s found a spiritual leader. He has become kind, soft-spoken, and earnest. He&apos;s even got a homeless kid set up in the spare room. Katie isn&apos;t sure if this is a deeply-felt conversion, a brain tumor, or David&apos;s most brilliantly vicious manipulation yet. Because she&apos;s finding it more and more difficult to live with David, and with herself.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-07-05T12:00:14.206Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:db79180ef135dc2d0122d5dfe20dc46762db5902","dn":"How to Be Good by Nick Hornby epub RtR","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"db79180ef135dc2d0122d5dfe20dc46762db5902","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,121,24,14,241,53,220,45,1,34,213,223,226,13,196,103,98,219,89,2]},"name":"How to Be Good by Nick Hornby epub RtR","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
