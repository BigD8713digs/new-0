Drawing upon influences like Alvvays, London Grammar, and Stars, Dizzy also channels the spirit of early Lorde with poetic lyrics and a similarly palpable frustration with mundane suburban life. Produced by Damian Taylor (Bjork, Arcade Fire, the Killers), Baby Teeth also draws upon the sounds of artists like Wet, Birdy, and fellow dream pop revivalist Hatchie. \r\nTogether with the trio of Spencer brothers, vocalist Katie Munshaw delivers a strong performance &#x2014; delicate without being too precious, wounded but confident &#x2014; heard on highlights like the atmospheric &#x201C;Swim,&#x201D; the sprawling &#x201C;Pretty Thing,&#x201D; and the hypnotic &#x201C;Stars and Moons,&#x201D; whose thrumming bass and persistent drumming invigorate the otherwise dreamy sonics with a vibrant heartbeat. Introspective moments like the heartbreak-and-healing &#x201C;Joshua&#x201D; and the gorgeous acoustic &#x201C;Pirouette&#x201D; provide contemplative doses of tranquility on an already relaxed album. \r\nBalancing restraint with a keen ear for pop-friendly hooks inspired by Jack Antonoff, Dizzy manage to make quite the opening statement with Baby Teeth. \r\n\r\nTracklist: \r\n01 - Stars and Moons.flac \r\n02 - Swim.flac \r\n03 - In Time.flac \r\n04 - Calico.flac \r\n05 - Ghost Limbs.flac \r\n06 - Bleachers.flac \r\n07 - Joshua.flac \r\n08 - Pretty Thing.flac \r\n09 - Backstroke.flac \r\n10 - Pirouette.flac \r\n11 - Arcadia (Bonus Track).flac \r\n\r\nSummary: \r\nCountry: Canada \r\nGenre: dream-pop, indie-pop","last_updated":"2018-09-22T12:28:34.806Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:76720f280fa78721b9682b59870a7c8b63105df2","dn":"[dream-pop, indie-pop] (2018) Dizzy - Baby Teeth [FLAC,Tracks] ","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"76720f280fa78721b9682b59870a7c8b63105df2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,114,15,40,15,167,135,33,185,104,43,89,135,10,124,139,99,16,93,242]},"name":"[dream-pop, indie-pop] (2018) Dizzy - Baby Teeth [FLAC,Tracks] ","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
