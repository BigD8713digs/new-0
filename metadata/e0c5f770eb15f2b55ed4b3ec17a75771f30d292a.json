Keith, a 12-year-old boy in the same apartment building - the self-styled &quot;meanest boy&quot; in town - also disappears.\r\n\r\nIn pursuit of the baby, the boy and the killer, are Keith&apos;s divorced mother and a cop who himself was once considered the meanest boy in town. Their search leads them down the humid byways of a Florida populated almost exclusively by people from somewhere else; emotional refugees seeking sanctuary along the swampy coast.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-10-11T12:02:50.043Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0c5f770eb15f2b55ed4b3ec17a75771f30d292a","dn":"Turtle Moon by Alice Hoffman EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"e0c5f770eb15f2b55ed4b3ec17a75771f30d292a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,197,247,112,235,21,242,181,94,212,179,236,23,167,87,113,243,13,41,42]},"name":"Turtle Moon by Alice Hoffman EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
