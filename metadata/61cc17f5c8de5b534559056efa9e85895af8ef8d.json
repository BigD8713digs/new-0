Dylan. Jagger. Belushi. Leibovitz. The story of Jann Wenner, Rolling Stone&apos;s founder, editor, and publisher, is an insider&apos;s trip through the backstages of storied concert venues, rock-star hotel rooms, and the political ups and downs of the latter half of the 20th century, right up through the digital age: connecting the counterculture of Haight Ashbury to the &quot;straight world&quot;.\r\n\r\nSupplemented by a cache of extraordinary documents and letters from Wenner&apos;s personal archives, Sticky Fingers is the story of a mercurial, wide-eyed rock and roll fan of ambiguous sexuality but unambiguous ambition who reinvents youth culture, marketing the libertine world of the late &apos;60s counterculture in a stylish, glossy package that would stand for decades as a testament to the cultural power of American youth. Joe Hagan captures in stunning detail the extraordinary lives constellated around a magazine that began as a scrappy rebellion and became a locus of power, influence, and access - using hundreds of hours of reporting and exclusive interviews.\r\n\r\nThe result is a fascinating and complex portrait of Jann Wenner that is also a biography of popular culture, celebrity, music, and politics in America over the last 50 years.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-10-26T12:00:42.337Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:61cc17f5c8de5b534559056efa9e85895af8ef8d","dn":"Sticky Fingers by Joe Hagan EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"61cc17f5c8de5b534559056efa9e85895af8ef8d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,204,23,245,200,222,91,83,69,89,5,110,250,158,133,137,90,248,239,141]},"name":"Sticky Fingers by Joe Hagan EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
