Homeschooled, she accompanies her loving father - brilliant, eccentric, socially inept - to work every day. By 12 she is a painfully shy prodigy.\r\n\r\nAt the same time that the lab begins to gain acclaim, David&apos;s mind begins to falter, and his mysterious past comes into question. When her father moves into a nursing home, Ada is taken in by one of David&apos;s colleagues. She embarks on a mission to uncover her father&apos;s secrets: a process that carries her from childhood to adulthood. Eventually Ada pioneers a type of software that enables her to make contact with her past and to reconcile the man she thought she knew with the truth.\r\n\r\nPraised for her ability to create quirky and unforgettable characters, Liz Moore has written a piercing story of a daughter&apos;s quest to restore the legacy of the father she desperately loves.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-12-25T12:07:29.102Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc4389472318b97a1b63c26bf802c24ab9677be5","dn":"The Unseen World by Liz Moore EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"cc4389472318b97a1b63c26bf802c24ab9677be5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,67,137,71,35,24,185,122,27,99,194,107,248,2,194,74,185,103,123,229]},"name":"The Unseen World by Liz Moore EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
