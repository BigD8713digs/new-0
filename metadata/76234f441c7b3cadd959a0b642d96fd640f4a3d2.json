The Internet shorthand IRL - &quot;in real life&quot; - now seems na&#xEF;ve. We no longer question the reality of online experiences but the reality of selfhood in the digital age.\r\n\r\nIn The Secret Life, the essayist and novelist Andrew O&apos;Hagan issues three bulletins from the porous border between cyberspace and IRL. &quot;Ghosting&quot; introduces us to the beguiling and divisive Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, whose autobiography the author agrees to ghostwrite with unforeseen - and unforgettable - consequences. &quot;The Invention of Ronnie Pinn&quot; finds the author using the actual identity of a deceased young man to construct an entirely new one in cyberspace, leading him on a journey deep into the Web&apos;s darkest realms. And &quot;The Satoshi Affair&quot; chronicles the strange case of Craig Wright, the Australian Web developer who may or may not be the mysterious inventor of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto - and who may or may not be willing, or even able, to reveal the truth.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-10-24T12:03:32.729Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:76234f441c7b3cadd959a0b642d96fd640f4a3d2","dn":"The Secret Life by Andrew O'Haga","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"76234f441c7b3cadd959a0b642d96fd640f4a3d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,35,79,68,28,123,60,173,217,89,160,182,66,217,111,214,64,244,163,210]},"name":"The Secret Life by Andrew O'Haga","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
