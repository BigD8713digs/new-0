Engulfed by vivid images of the past, she reminisces about a trio of girls who initiated her into the fierce politics of childhood and its secret world of friendship, longing, and betrayal. Elaine must come to terms with her own identity as a daughter, a lover, an artist, and a woman--but above all she must seek release from her haunting memories. Disturbing, hilarious, and compassionate, Cat&apos;s Eye is a breathtaking novel of a woman grappling with the tangled knot of her life.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-07-24T12:02:39.587Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:c1fbc4b35c04b9563d19aad30ee6476bbe803539","dn":"Cat's Eye by Margaret Atwood epub RtR","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"c1fbc4b35c04b9563d19aad30ee6476bbe803539","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,251,196,179,92,4,185,86,61,25,170,211,14,230,71,107,190,128,53,57]},"name":"Cat's Eye by Margaret Atwood epub RtR","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
