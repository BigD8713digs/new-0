He has a warm\r\ndeep voice in the classic Nashville mold, and he and his skilled\r\nband favor a clean blend of country and classic rock, with banjos\r\nsitting comfortably alongside electric guitar and heavy drums;\r\nalbum opener &quot;Baby Come Back to Me&quot; even borrows the high-school\r\nbleachers backbeat from Queen&apos;s &quot;We Will Rock You.&quot; Like his\r\nself-tltled freshman album, there are nods to hip-hop and R&amp;B see\r\nthe trap hi-hats on &quot;American Bad Dream&quot; or the Mint\r\nCondition-esque band hits on &quot;Weekend&quot; but these songs are\r\nundeniably country. Brown may have started out as a Nashville\r\noutsider, but he&apos;s making himself right at home","last_updated":"2018-11-16T12:12:30.210Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:a97b41ee6b085cb344908c62c2af96d1fe06d4f9","dn":"Kane Brown-Experiment-CD-FLAC-2018-FORSAKEN ","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"a97b41ee6b085cb344908c62c2af96d1fe06d4f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,123,65,238,107,8,92,179,68,144,140,98,194,175,150,209,254,6,212,249]},"name":"Kane Brown-Experiment-CD-FLAC-2018-FORSAKEN ","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
