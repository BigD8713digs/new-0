Why does Schlegel persist with the case when no one cares because the Jews are all being shipped out anyway? And why should Eiko Morgen, wearing the dreaded black uniform of the SS, turn up and say he has been assigned to work with him?\r\nCorpses, dressed with fake money, bodies flayed beyond recognition\r\n\r\nThe Butchers of Berlin-Chris Petit \r\nPale Horse Riding - Chris Petit\r\nThe Human Pool - Chris Petit\r\nThe Passenger - Chris Petit\r\nThe Psalm Killer - Chris Petit","last_updated":"2017-12-20T12:07:04.902Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:73563afa017ca118f4751d21d34d744a580adcf1","dn":"Chris Petit collection 5 books (EPUB)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"73563afa017ca118f4751d21d34d744a580adcf1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,86,58,250,1,124,161,24,244,117,29,33,211,77,116,74,88,10,220,241]},"name":"Chris Petit collection 5 books (EPUB)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
