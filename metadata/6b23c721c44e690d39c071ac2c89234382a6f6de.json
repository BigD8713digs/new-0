A &quot;spirit photographer&quot;, William Mumler took portrait photographs that featured the ghostly presence of a lost loved one alongside the living subject. Mumler was a sensation: The affluent and influential came calling, including Mary Todd Lincoln, who arrived at his studio in disguise amid rumors of seances in the White House.\r\n\r\nPeter Manseau brilliantly captures a nation wracked with grief and hungry for proof of the existence of ghosts and for contact with their dead husbands and sons. It took a circus-like trial of Mumler on fraud charges, starring P. T. Barnum for the prosecution, to expose a fault line of doubt and manipulation. And even then the judge sided with the defense - nobody ever solved the mystery of his spirit photography.\r\n\r\nThis forgotten puzzle offers a vivid snapshot of America at a crossroads in its history, a nation in thrall to new technology while clinging desperately to belief.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-11-02T12:04:45.287Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b23c721c44e690d39c071ac2c89234382a6f6de","dn":"The Apparitionists by Peter Manseau EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"6b23c721c44e690d39c071ac2c89234382a6f6de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,35,199,33,196,78,105,13,57,192,113,172,44,137,35,67,130,166,246,222]},"name":"The Apparitionists by Peter Manseau EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
