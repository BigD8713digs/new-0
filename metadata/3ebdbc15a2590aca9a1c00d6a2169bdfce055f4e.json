The work was first performed on 26 April 1899 by the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by the composer, in an original, well received version which has not survived. After the premiere, Sibelius made some revisions, resulting in the version performed today. The revision was completed in the spring and summer of 1900, and was first performed in Berlin by the Helsinki Philharmonic, conducted by Robert Kajanus on 18 July 1900.[83] The symphony begins with a highly original, rather forlorn clarinet solo backed by subdued timpani","last_updated":"2017-06-05T12:04:21.283Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ebdbc15a2590aca9a1c00d6a2169bdfce055f4e","dn":"Sibelius - Symphonies No. 1","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"3ebdbc15a2590aca9a1c00d6a2169bdfce055f4e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,189,188,21,162,89,10,202,154,28,0,214,162,22,155,223,206,5,95,78]},"name":"Sibelius - Symphonies No. 1","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
