Free to lend and reluctant to collect, he has left his family on the edge of poverty - until Miryem intercedes. Hardening her heart, she sets out to retrieve what is owed and soon gains a reputation for being able to turn silver into gold. But when an ill-advised boast brings her to the attention of the cold creatures who haunt the wood, nothing will be the same again. For words have power, and the fate of a kingdom will be forever altered by the challenge she is issued.\r\n\r\nChanneling the heart of the classic fairy tale, Novik deftly interweaves six distinct narrative voices - each learning valuable lessons about sacrifice, power and love - into a rich, multilayered fantasy that readers will want to return to again and again.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-07-11T12:06:23.480Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd30281f91d7e923be74e0c1dfb3e7511323fd41","dn":"Spinning Silver by Naomi Novik EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"dd30281f91d7e923be74e0c1dfb3e7511323fd41","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,48,40,31,145,215,233,35,190,116,224,193,223,179,231,81,19,35,253,65]},"name":"Spinning Silver by Naomi Novik EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
