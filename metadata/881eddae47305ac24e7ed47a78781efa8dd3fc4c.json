He tells three Milan book editors that he has discovered a coded message about a Templar Plan, centuries old and involving Stonehenge, a plan to tap a mystic source of power far greater than atomic energy.\r\n\r\nThe editors, who have spent altogether too much time rewriting crackpot manuscripts on the occult by fanatics and dilettante, decide to have a little fun. They&apos;ll create a Plan of their own. But how? Randomly they throw together manuscript pages on hermetic thought: The Masters of the World, who live beneath the earth. The Comte de Saint-Germain, who lives forever. They add Satanic initiation rites of the Kings of the Temple, Assassins, Rosicrucians, Brazilian voodoo, the Third Reich. And they feed all this, and much more, into their powerful computer. Abulafia. A terrific joke, they think, until the Plan assumes a life and power of its own, and turns deadly...as people mysteriously begin to disappear, one by one, starting with Colonel Ardenti.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-07-21T12:00:42.252Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:881eddae47305ac24e7ed47a78781efa8dd3fc4c","dn":"Foucault's Pendulum by Umberto Eco epub RtR","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"881eddae47305ac24e7ed47a78781efa8dd3fc4c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,30,221,174,71,48,90,194,78,126,212,122,120,120,30,250,141,211,252,76]},"name":"Foucault's Pendulum by Umberto Eco epub RtR","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
