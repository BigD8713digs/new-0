Traditionally used by \r\nlarge corporations and OEMs (to preinstall Windows client operating systems on PCs during manufacturing), it is now widely \r\navailable free of charge via Windows Automated Installation Kit (WAIK) and Windows ADK (Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit)\r\nYou can choose between x86 and x64 WinPE as you need.
