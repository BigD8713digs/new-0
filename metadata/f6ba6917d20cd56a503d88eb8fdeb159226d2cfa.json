Esposito and Rose Styron\r\nForeEdge | April 2018 | eISBN: 978-1-5126-0255-5 | ePUB | 28.9 mb\r\n\r\nIn April 1962, President and Mrs. John F. Kennedy hosted forty-nine Nobel Prize winners-along with many other prominent scientists, artists, and writers-at a famed White House dinner.\r\nAmong the guests were J. Robert Oppenheimer, who was officially welcomed back to Washington after a stint in the political wilderness; Linus Pauling, who had picketed the White House that very afternoon; William and Rose Styron, who began a fifty-year friendship with the Kennedy family that night; James Baldwin, who would later discuss civil rights with Attorney General Robert Kennedy; Mary Welsh Hemingway, Ernest Hemingway&apos;s widow, who sat next to the president and grilled him on Cuba policy; John Glenn, who had recently orbited the earth aboard Friendship 7; historian Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., who argued with Ava Pauling at dinner; and many others. Actor Frederic March gave a public recitation after the meal, including some unpublished work of Hemingway&apos;s that later became part of Islands in the Stream.\r\n\r\nAbout the author <a href=\"\nhttps://s8.postimg.cc/k5po1bnxx/Esposito.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://s8.postimg.cc/k5po1bnxx/Esposito.jpg</a>\r\nJoseph A.
