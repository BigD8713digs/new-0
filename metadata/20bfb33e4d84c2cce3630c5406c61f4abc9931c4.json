And why is he there and not at a local college in Newark where he originally enrolled? Because his father, the sturdy, hardworking neighborhood butcher, seems to have gone mad - mad with fear and apprehension of the dangers of adult life, the dangers of the world, the dangers he sees on every corner for his beloved boy. Far from Newark, Marcus has to find his way amid the customs and constrictions of another American world.\r\n\r\nIndignation, Philip Roth&apos;s 29th book, is a startling departure from the haunted narratives of old age and experience in Roth&apos;s recent books and a powerful exploration of a remarkable moment in American history.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-07-08T12:00:20.313Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:20bfb33e4d84c2cce3630c5406c61f4abc9931c4","dn":"Indignation by Philip Roth epub RtR","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"20bfb33e4d84c2cce3630c5406c61f4abc9931c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,191,179,62,77,132,194,204,227,99,12,84,6,198,31,74,188,153,49,196]},"name":"Indignation by Philip Roth epub RtR","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
