Discussions focus on reflectance rivalry and spatial frequency detection, figure-ground separation by filling-in barriers, and disinhibitory propagation of functional scaling from boundaries to interiors. The text then takes a look at neural dynamics of perceptual grouping and brightness perception. Topics include simulation of a parametric binocular brightness study, smoothly varying luminance contours versus steps of luminance change, macrocircuit of processing stages, paradoxical percepts as probes of adaptive processes, and analysis of the Beck theory of textural segmentation. \r\n\r\nThe book examines the neural dynamics of speech and language coding and word recognition and recall, including automatic activation and limited-capacity attention, a macrocircuit for the self-organization of recognition and recall, role of intra-list restructuring arid contextual associations, and temporal order information across item representations. \r\n\r\nThe manuscript is a vital source of data for scientists and researchers interested in the development of a true theory of mind and brain","last_updated":"2017-06-15T12:03:05.608Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:48c94ab33ea94822acfd6636bada07198e2d209a","dn":"The Adaptive Brain II - Vision, Speech, Language, and Motor Cont","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"48c94ab33ea94822acfd6636bada07198e2d209a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,201,74,179,62,169,72,34,172,253,102,54,186,218,7,25,142,45,32,154]},"name":"The Adaptive Brain II - Vision, Speech, Language, and Motor Cont","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
