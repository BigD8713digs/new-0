In a journey that is both literal and historical, Rageh Omaar travels to the place of Muhammad&#x2019;s birth to re-trace his actual footsteps; from humble beginnings in Mecca, his struggles with his prophetic role and divine revelations, his migration to Medina, to the establishment of the first Islamic constitution, and his subsequent military and political successes and failures, before his final return to Mecca following armed conflicts through to his death and his legacy.\r\nIt also raises questions about Islam&#x2019;s role in the world today and explores where Islam&#x2019;s attitudes towards money, charity, women, social equality, religious tolerance, war and conflict originate.\r\n <a href=\"\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b012mkh7\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b012mkh7</a>\r\n\r\n <a href=\"\nhttps://plus.google.com/+Dr3adLoX/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://plus.google.com/+Dr3adLoX/</a> - Hundreds of conspiracy torrents here!!!","last_updated":"2017-05-29T13:15:32.425Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:72af68a8b83662b31fad985ace00a40ae8cbc27f","dn":"BBC.The.Life.of.Muhammad.2011.720p.HDTV.x265-Dr3adLoX","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"72af68a8b83662b31fad985ace00a40ae8cbc27f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,175,104,168,184,54,98,179,31,173,152,90,206,0,164,10,232,203,194,127]},"name":"BBC.The.Life.of.Muhammad.2011.720p.HDTV.x265-Dr3adLoX","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
