He began his career in blues and blues rock and evolved to a more pop-oriented sound which, from the mid-1970s through the early 1980s, resulted in a series of highly popular singles and albums. Miller was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2016.\r\n\r\nThe event was controversial due to Miller&apos;s remarks about the experience being &quot;unpleasant&quot; and the Hall of Fame was misogynistic and &quot;need to respect the artists they say they&#x2019;re honoring, which they don&apos;t.&quot;, and controlling aspects such as the licensing contracts.\r\nThe Black Keys, who were told to induct Miller stated that they regretted the experience. Dan Auerbach and Patrick Carney whined, Miller, however had no idea who the band was and did not care. Auerbach and Carney left as soon as they finished their speech and nobody noticed they were gone.    LOL enough history.....\r\n\r\nThis is a good a listen as it gets. Of course it helps if you like Steve Miller.\r\n\r\nIf you do.......I guarantee this this time frame in his career he was at the top of his\r\n\r\ngame and the charts. Although the charts as far as Im concerned are meaningless as far as\r\n\r\nan artists skills go it just means that the sheep got with the program while it was still going\r\n\r\nLOL.\r\n\r\nThese were great times....beer 50 cents a cup. Steve Miller was smiling\r\n\r\nfrom ear to ear this entire show. You want kick ass rock with all the dynamic range?\r\n\r\nThen I suggest you crank this show on your best system!\r\n\r\nTracklist\r\n\r\nDisk 1\r\n\r\n294.35mb\r\n00:51:51\r\nFLAC\r\n\r\n1 Swingtown.\r\n2 Space Cowboy.\r\n3 Mercury Blues.\r\n4 Fly Like An Eagle.\r\n5 Wild Mountain Honey.\r\n6 The Joker.m\r\n7 Gangster Of Love.\r\n8 Living in the USA.\r\n9 Something Special.\r\n10 Keeps Me Wondering Why.\r\n\r\nDisk 2\r\n\r\n378.56mb\r\n1:06:00\r\nFLAC\r\n\r\n11 Get on Home.\r\n12 Heart Like A Wheel.\r\n13 Macho City-band intro.\r\n14 Abracadabra.\r\n15 Rock n Me.\r\n16 Give it Up.\r\n17 Jet Airliner.\r\n18 Jet Airliner (cont.).\r\n19 Jungle Love.\r\n20 Home Sweet Home Milwaukee-Texas Blues.\r\n21 Swingtown.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlayers\r\n\r\nSteve Miller &#x2013; guitar, vocals, harmonica, keyboards, synthesizers (1966&#x2013;Present)\r\nKenny Lee Lewis - guitar, bass, backing vocals (1982-1987, 1993&#x2013;Present)\r\nGary Mallaber - drums, percussion, keyboards, backing vocals (1976-1987)\r\nGerald Johnson - bass, backing vocals (1972-1973, 1981-1983)\r\nByron Allred - keyboards, synthesizers (1976-1987, 1990)\r\nNorton Buffalo - harmonica, guitar, backing vocals (1976-1978, 1982-1987, 1989-2009, died 2009)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA big thankx to plumdusty you were there","last_updated":"2017-06-11T12:01:22.516Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:596b6d3fca90d980c19e79035b11f108a08130c4","dn":"Steve Miller Band - Milwaukee Summerfest 1982 (Live  2-CD) 2017 ","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"596b6d3fca90d980c19e79035b11f108a08130c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,107,109,63,202,144,217,128,193,158,121,3,91,17,241,8,160,129,48,196]},"name":"Steve Miller Band - Milwaukee Summerfest 1982 (Live  2-CD) 2017 ","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
