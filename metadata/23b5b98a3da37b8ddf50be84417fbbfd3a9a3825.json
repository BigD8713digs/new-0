A patrol sent to rescue him finds itself in a bloody and disastrous fire-fight.\r\n\r\nHow was Private Lyons abducted from a heavily fortified command post? And why does the Army close ranks to disguise what happened during the mission to save him?\r\n\r\nThe bewildered wives and families of the dead are left craving answers. Their fight for justice is every bit as ugly as the one fought by their loved ones in the poppy fields of Afghanistan.\r\n\r\nTheir hopes lie with Coroner Jenny Cooper, who takes on the full might of the military to stop the truth being buried with the boy soldiers. But in a town filled with secrets and rumours, it&apos;s not only the Army that has something to hide","last_updated":"2018-10-13T12:45:59.593Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:23b5b98a3da37b8ddf50be84417fbbfd3a9a3825","dn":"M R Hall - [Jenny Cooper 07] - A Life to Kill","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"23b5b98a3da37b8ddf50be84417fbbfd3a9a3825","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,181,185,138,61,163,123,141,223,80,190,132,65,127,187,253,58,154,56,37]},"name":"M R Hall - [Jenny Cooper 07] - A Life to Kill","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
