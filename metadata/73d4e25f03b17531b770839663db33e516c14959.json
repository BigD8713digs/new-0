His life was structured, routine. Boring, even. All he wanted was a little excitement - he just never expected to be arrested for his own father&apos;s murder. \r\n\r\nCaught between the lies of corrupt cops and a silver-haired stranger, Blake flees across Los Angeles to learn the truth of his father&apos;s mysterious past. The deeper he goes, the bigger the lies become. The only certain thing is that he can&apos;t run forever. \r\n\r\nThe secrets come thick and fast in a new relentless spy novel. Full of lies and conspiracies, this rocket-paced thriller follows a man pitted against his own family, the LAPD, and a corrupt government agency.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-09-29T12:09:12.748Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:73d4e25f03b17531b770839663db33e516c14959","dn":"Clean Kill (Bloodline, Book 1) by Adam Nicholls EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"73d4e25f03b17531b770839663db33e516c14959","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,212,226,95,3,177,117,49,183,112,131,150,99,219,51,229,22,193,73,89]},"name":"Clean Kill (Bloodline, Book 1) by Adam Nicholls EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
