As a solitary teenager stranded in the suburbs, Rob Sheffield had a lot to learn about women, love, music, and himself. And he was sure his radio had all the answers. \r\n\r\nAs evidenced by the bestselling sales of Sheffield&apos;s first book, Love Is a Mix Tape, the connection between music and memory strikes a chord with readers. Talking to Girls About Duran Duran strikes that chord all over again, and is a pitch-perfect trip through &apos;80s music-from Bowie to Bobby Brown, from hair metal to hip-hop. But this book is not just about music. It&apos;s about growing up and how every song is a snapshot of a moment that you&apos;ll remember the rest of your life","last_updated":"2018-08-25T12:07:40.181Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:6978724be455431e553987d0fd106597a9782dd7","dn":"Talking to Girls About Duran Duran by Rob Sheffield (.epub)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"6978724be455431e553987d0fd106597a9782dd7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,120,114,75,228,85,67,30,85,57,135,208,253,16,101,151,169,120,45,215]},"name":"Talking to Girls About Duran Duran by Rob Sheffield (.epub)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
