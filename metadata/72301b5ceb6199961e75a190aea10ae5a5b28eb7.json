These are merged together in a work that seems to me a call for peace, but also about death and sorrow. The work is divided into sixteen parts, but belong to eachother. I must admit I wasn&apos;t blown away by it. There are introspective, textured pieces which work quite well, such as &apos;Anno Domini&apos;, but some of the electronics sounded a bit muddy. The overall sound is, perhaps by purpose, not very clear. Then there are some stomping rhythm pieces which seem to be out of place. It sounds like Lunyov couldn&apos;t make up his mind with what he wanted to do. It has its moments, but also it failures. - Frans de Waard, Vital Weekly","last_updated":"2017-05-27T08:50:10.254Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:72301b5ceb6199961e75a190aea10ae5a5b28eb7","dn":"Svyatoslav Lunyov 2006 Para Pacem, Para Bellum","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"72301b5ceb6199961e75a190aea10ae5a5b28eb7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,48,27,92,235,97,153,150,30,117,161,144,174,161,10,229,165,178,142,183]},"name":"Svyatoslav Lunyov 2006 Para Pacem, Para Bellum","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
