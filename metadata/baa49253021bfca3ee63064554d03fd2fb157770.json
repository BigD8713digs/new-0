So she decided to write it herself.\r\n\r\nAnd Now We Have Everything is O&apos;Connell&apos;s exploration of the cataclysmic, impossible-to-prepare-for experience of becoming a mother. With her dark humor and hair-trigger B.S. detector, O&apos;Connell addresses the pervasive imposter syndrome that comes with unplanned pregnancy, the fantasies of a &quot;natural&quot; birth experience that erode maternal self-esteem, post-partum body and sex issues, and the fascinating strangeness of stepping into a new, not-yet-comfortable identity.\r\n\r\nChanneling fears and anxieties that are still taboo and often unspoken, And Now We Have Everything is an unflinchingly frank, funny, and visceral motherhood story for our times, about having a baby and staying, for better or worse, exactly yourself.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-05-10T12:02:19.451Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:baa49253021bfca3ee63064554d03fd2fb157770","dn":"And Now We Have Everything by Meaghan O'Connell EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"baa49253021bfca3ee63064554d03fd2fb157770","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,164,146,83,2,27,252,163,238,99,6,69,84,208,63,210,251,21,119,112]},"name":"And Now We Have Everything by Meaghan O'Connell EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
