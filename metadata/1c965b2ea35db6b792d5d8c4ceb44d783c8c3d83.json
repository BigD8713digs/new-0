Where has the joy and relaxation gone from our daily lives? Scribbles in the Margins offers a glorious antidote to that relentless modern-day information churn. It is here to remind you that books and bookshops can still sing to your heart.\r\n\r\nWarm, heartfelt and witty, here are fifty short essays of prose poetry dedicated to the simple joy to be found in reading and the rituals around it. These are not wallowing nostalgia; they are things that remain pleasurable and right, that warm our hearts and connect us to books, to reading and to other readers: smells of books, old or new; losing an afternoon organising bookshelves; libraries; watching a child learn to read; reading in bed; impromptu bookmarks; visiting someone&apos;s home and inspecting the bookshelves; stains and other reminders of where and when you read a book.\r\n\r\nAn attempt to fondly weigh up what makes a book so much more than paper and ink - and reading so much more than a hobby, a way of passing time or a learning process - these declarations of love demonstrate what books and reading mean to us as individuals, and the cherished part they play in our lives, from the vivid greens and purples of childhood books to the dusty comfort novels we turn to in times of adult flux.\r\n\r\nScribbles in the Margins is a love-letter to books and bookshops, rejoicing in the many universal and sometimes odd little ways that reading and the rituals around reading make us happy","last_updated":"2017-05-23T18:45:28.029Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c965b2ea35db6b792d5d8c4ceb44d783c8c3d83","dn":"Scribbles in the Margins - 50 Eternal Delights of Books (2017) G","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"1c965b2ea35db6b792d5d8c4ceb44d783c8c3d83","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,150,91,46,163,93,182,183,146,213,216,196,206,180,77,120,60,140,61,131]},"name":"Scribbles in the Margins - 50 Eternal Delights of Books (2017) G","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
