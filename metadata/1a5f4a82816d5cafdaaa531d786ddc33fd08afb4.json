Among the teen counselors, tensions and hormones are running high. No wonder the others agree when Jo-Beth Chancellor suggests they scare Monica O&#x2019;Neal a little&#x2026; or a lot. Monica has it coming, and no one will really get hurt. What could go wrong?\r\nEverything.\r\nTwenty years later, Lucas Dalton, a senior detective with the sheriff&#x2019;s department, is investigating the discovery of human remains in a cavern at what used to be Camp Horseshoe. Lucas knows the spot well. His father, a preacher, ran the camp, and Lucas worked there that infamous summer when two girls went missing. No one knows what happened to either of them, though with a dangerous convict on the loose, gossip was rife that they may have been kidnapped, or worse.\r\nFor Lucas, the case is personal&#x2014;perhaps too much so. But it&#x2019;s time to uncover the whole truth at last. That&#x2019;s why seven former female counselors are coming back to the small Oregon town&#x2014;among them, Bernadette Alsace, the woman Lucas has never forgotten. Each one knows something about that terrible night. Each promised not to tell. And as they reunite, a new horror unfolds. First come texts containing a personal memento and a simple, terrifying message: YOU WILL PAY. Then, the murders begin.\r\nIt started years ago. But it will end here&#x2014;as a web of lust, greed, and betrayal is untangled to reveal a killer waiting to enact the perfect revenge.\r\n\r\nEnjoy and please SEED!!!","last_updated":"2017-06-18T12:00:17.132Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a5f4a82816d5cafdaaa531d786ddc33fd08afb4","dn":"You Will Pay - Lisa Jackson [EN EPUB MOBI AZW3] [ebook] [ps]","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"1a5f4a82816d5cafdaaa531d786ddc33fd08afb4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,95,74,130,129,109,92,175,218,170,83,29,120,109,220,51,253,8,175,180]},"name":"You Will Pay - Lisa Jackson [EN EPUB MOBI AZW3] [ebook] [ps]","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
