Over the next decade, life would become increasingly fraught with depression and self-harm, and her outlook only bleaker. Before her eighteenth birthday, Rachael would twice try to take her own life. \r\n\r\nAnd yet amidst this darkness, a flicker of faith lived on. \r\n\r\nThis is Rachael&#x2019;s story of her journey into, and out of, the darkness of depression. With unflinching realism and complete honesty, she shows us what it looks like to live with mental illness, and how God can find us and rescue us even in the most desperate of places.\r\n\r\nGenre: Non-Fiction &gt; General","last_updated":"2018-09-21T12:23:45.752Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:92a60421dd3f8813ac69df335b71fa3a2a709980","dn":"Learning to Breathe by Rachael Newham (.epub)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"92a60421dd3f8813ac69df335b71fa3a2a709980","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,166,4,33,221,63,136,19,172,105,223,51,91,113,250,58,42,112,153,128]},"name":"Learning to Breathe by Rachael Newham (.epub)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
