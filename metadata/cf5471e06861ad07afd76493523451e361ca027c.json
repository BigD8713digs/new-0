He opens a door, and then he invites us to walk through it - into the unknown. And how we choose to respond will ultimately determine the lives we will lead and the people we will become. In fact, to fail to embrace the open door is to miss the work God has made for us to do.\r\n\r\nIn All the Places to Go...How Will You Know?, best-selling author John Ortberg opens our eyes to the countless doors God places before us every day, teaches us how to recognize them, and gives us the encouragement to step out in faith and embrace all of the extraordinary opportunities that await.\r\n\r\nSo go ahead - walk through that door. You just might do something that lasts for eternity.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-09-23T12:07:17.992Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf5471e06861ad07afd76493523451e361ca027c","dn":"All the Places to Go...How Will You Know by John Ortberg EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"cf5471e06861ad07afd76493523451e361ca027c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,84,113,224,104,97,173,7,175,215,100,147,82,52,81,227,97,202,2,124]},"name":"All the Places to Go...How Will You Know by John Ortberg EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
