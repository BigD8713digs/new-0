In 2000, Larry Ellison, co-founder and billionaire CEO of Oracle Corporation, decided to run for the coveted prize and found an unlikely partner in Norbert Bajurin, a car radiator mechanic who had recently been named Commodore of the blue collar Golden Gate Yacht Club.\r\n\r\nJulian Guthrie&#x2019;s The Billionaire and the Mechanic tells the incredible story of the partnership between Larry and Norbert, their unsuccessful runs for the Cup in 2003 and 2007, and their victory in 2010. With unparalleled access to Ellison and his team, Guthrie takes readers inside the design and building process of these astonishing boats, and the management of the passionate athletes who race them. She traces the bitter rivalries between Oracle and their competitors, including Swiss billionaire Ernesto Bertarelli&#x2019;s Team Alinghi, and throws readers into exhilarating races from Australia and New Zealand to Valencia, Spain.\r\n\r\nWith new television coverage and huge media, the America&#x2019;s Cup is poised to be bigger than ever, and The Billionaire and the Mechanic is a must-read for anyone interested in the race or this remarkable story.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-07-09T12:00:45.389Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:a97a84fb7e5074e14f770fc88c8fedeab10bfe7e","dn":"The Billionaire and the Mechanic by Julian Guthrie ePUB eBOOK-ZA","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"a97a84fb7e5074e14f770fc88c8fedeab10bfe7e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,122,132,251,126,80,116,225,79,119,15,200,140,143,237,234,177,11,254,126]},"name":"The Billionaire and the Mechanic by Julian Guthrie ePUB eBOOK-ZA","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
