Spanning a matter of hours, Across the River and into the Trees is tender and moving, yet tragic in the inexorable shadow of what must come","last_updated":"2017-05-29T13:18:10.262Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:40a45d182f644700da622379ce14d3b915e7002e","dn":"Across the River and Into the Trees by Ernest Hemingway epub RtR","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"40a45d182f644700da622379ce14d3b915e7002e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,164,93,24,47,100,71,0,218,98,35,121,206,20,211,185,21,231,0,46]},"name":"Across the River and Into the Trees by Ernest Hemingway epub RtR","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
