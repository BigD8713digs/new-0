In this fascinating book, he reveals a singular bond - which included a spiritual connection between the Catholic pope and the Protestant president - that drove the two men to confront what they knew to be the great evil of the 20th century: Soviet communism.\r\n\r\nReagan and John Paul II almost didn&apos;t have the opportunity to forge this relationship: just six weeks apart in the spring of 1981, they took bullets from would-be assassins. But their strikingly similar near-death experiences brought them close together - to Moscow&apos;s dismay.\r\n\r\nA Pope and a President is the product of years of research. Based on Kengor&apos;s tireless archival digging and his unique access to Reagan insiders, this book reveals captivating new details on a relationship that changed history.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-02-07T12:06:02.094Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe2d2b0c8d27cbb2a53dc41a2803ca97ac83b9e2","dn":"A Pope and a President by Paul Kengor EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"fe2d2b0c8d27cbb2a53dc41a2803ca97ac83b9e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,45,43,12,141,39,203,178,165,61,196,26,40,3,202,151,172,131,185,226]},"name":"A Pope and a President by Paul Kengor EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
