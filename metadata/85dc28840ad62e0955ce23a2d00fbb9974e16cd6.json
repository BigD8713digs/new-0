Each volume consists of four or five current bestselling novels selected by Digest editors and abridged (or &quot;condensed&quot;) to shorter form to accommodate the anthology format\r\n\r\n1. The Ambler Warning: Robert Ludlum\r\nHidden on a remote island is a top-secret facility housing former US intelligence operatives who present a security risk to their government. One of them, Hal Ambler, escapes&#x2014;only to find that every detail of his past has been erased. On the run, he uncovers a high-level conspiracy to bring about a major shift in the balance of world power.\r\n\r\n2. True Believer: Nicholas Sparks\r\nJeremy Marsh, a science journalist, hears about the ghostly lights that appear on foggy nights in a cemetery in North Carolina and sets off to investigate. On arriving in Boone Creek he is charmed by the locals and, in particular, by librarian Lexie Darnell. He soon discovers that logic is no help when it comes to unravelling matters of the human heart.\r\n\r\n3. Tyrannosaur Canyon: Douglas Preston\r\nWhen a fossil hunter makes the discovery of a lifetime in a canyon in New Mexico, he soon has a host of interested\r\nparties on his tail, including a greedy collector, a passionate scientist, and vet Tom Broadbent, who just wants to do right by a dead man&apos;s daughter. This Indiana-Jones-style adventure novel takes an intriguing look at what caused the extinction of the dinosaurs.\r\n\r\n4.
