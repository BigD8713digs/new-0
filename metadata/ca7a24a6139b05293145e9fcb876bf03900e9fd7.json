The first single, &quot;Live Today Love Tomorrow&quot; was released in 1982.[5] They subsequently enjoyed a successful career with several hit singles and albums across the 1980s before splitting up at the beginning of the 1990s. Their first hit song was &quot;Digging Your Scene&quot;, which hit No. 12 on the UK Singles Chart and No. 14 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in August 1986. They had four albums and eleven singles in the UK charts from 1986 and 1990.\r\nChoices &#x2013; The Singles Collection is their compilation album, released in 1989 by RCA and distributed by BMG/Ariola. The album includes most of the band&apos;s singles and features genres from the new wave of their debut album to pop rock and funky evolution, up to their discovery of the potentialities of the new dance revolution, a genre that they embraced on their final album, Springtime for the World, which was released the following year, shortly before they split up.\r\n\r\nGenre: Pop / Synh-Pop\r\nYear of production: 1989\r\nDisc Manufacturer: Germany\r\nLabel: RCA/BMG\r\nAudio codec: FLAC\r\nRip type: image + CUE\r\nSource: Web\r\n\r\nTracklist:\r\nWords &amp; music by Dr. Robert, except track 13 by Dr. Robert/Mick Anker\r\n1.Wait (1989) from Whoops!
