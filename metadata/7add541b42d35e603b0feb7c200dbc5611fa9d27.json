Now, instead of streaking her hair purple, dreaming of becoming an artist, and sneaking cigarettes in her friend Sophie&apos;s basement, she has a career in advertising in Los Angeles and attends black-tie dinners with her executive husband. She fears that she is fast becoming the type of person she once despised.\r\n\r\nWhen Alison receives news that Sophie has died of a drug overdose, leaving behind a slew of unanswered questions, she must go back home. Once there, she unearths reminders of her unruly past, including feelings for Sophie&apos;s brother, Matt - and finds that she is still powerfully attracted to him.\r\n\r\nCareening dangerously close to a full-blown affair, Alison must now make an impossible decision. But when a long-buried secret about Sophie resurfaces, it shatters everything Alison had always believed about the past - and forces her to rethink her own life, her marriage, and her future.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-01-30T12:00:41.700Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:7add541b42d35e603b0feb7c200dbc5611fa9d27","dn":"The Long Deception by Mary McCluskey EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"7add541b42d35e603b0feb7c200dbc5611fa9d27","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,221,84,27,66,211,94,96,59,15,235,124,32,13,188,86,17,250,157,39]},"name":"The Long Deception by Mary McCluskey EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
