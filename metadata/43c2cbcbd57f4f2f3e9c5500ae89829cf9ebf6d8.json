Keynesian schoolteachers and the liberal media have filled the world with politically correct errors that myth-busting professor Robert Murphy sets straight.\r\n\r\nMurphy explains hot topics like outsourcing (why it&apos;s good for Americans) and zoning restrictions (why they&apos;re not). Just like the other books in the P.I.G. series, The Politically Incorrect Guide to Capitalism pulls no punches. Murphy defends the free market on such issues as safety regulations, racial discrimination, and child-labor laws, in a breezy manner that is anything but textbook-like. The Politically Incorrect Guide to Capitalism sets the record straight on everything you thought you knew about economics.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-08-16T12:00:08.318Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:43c2cbcbd57f4f2f3e9c5500ae89829cf9ebf6d8","dn":"The Politically Incorrect Guide to Capitalism by Robert P Murphy","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"43c2cbcbd57f4f2f3e9c5500ae89829cf9ebf6d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,194,203,203,213,127,79,47,62,156,85,0,174,137,130,156,249,235,246,216]},"name":"The Politically Incorrect Guide to Capitalism by Robert P Murphy","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
