The concert was held in honor of the fiftieth anniversary of the liberation of Europe and is the largest memorial concert ever held in the Netherlands and was thought of by Arno Geul. Preparations lasted for about a year.\r\nPerformances were provided by Alan Parsons (with Chris Thompson and Mick Mullins), Art Garfunkel, Joe Cocker, Cyndi Lauper, Wet Wet Wet, Candy Dulfer, UB40 and Ren&#xE9; Froger. Also present was the Metropole Orkest consisting of 80 men and the Gelders Opera and Operetta Gezelschap (GOOG) choir. The event-specific configuration of The Alan Parsons Project, which had been a studio group only, was one of the first ever live performances of the band&apos;s material, albeit without cofounder Eric Woolfson; it was performed under the name of Alan Parsons Band.[3] The musical performances were accompanied by historical readings by Walter Cronkite and an illustrative performance by the Royal Netherlands Army.\r\n\r\nYear of manufacture: 1995\r\nCountry: Netherlands\r\nGenre: Pop, Rock\r\nDuration: 1:46:53\r\nQuality: TVRip\r\nFormat: DVD Video\r\nVideo codec: MPEG2\r\nAudio Codec: AC3\r\nVideo: PAL 720x576, 4350 Kbps (medium), 0.43 Qf\r\nAudio: AC3 Stereo (2/0); 48kHz, 256 kbps\r\n\r\nTracklist:\r\n01.
