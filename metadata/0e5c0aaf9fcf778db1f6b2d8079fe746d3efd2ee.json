What is the moral function of the law of armed conflict? Should the law protect civilians who do not fight but help those who do? Should the law protect soldiers who perform non-combat functions or who may be safely captured? How certain should a soldier be that an individual is a combatant rather than a civilian before using lethal force? What risks should soldiers take on themselves to avoid harming civilians? When do inaccurate weapons become unlawfully indiscriminate? When does `collateral damage` to civilians become unlawfully disproportionate? Should civilians lose their legal rights by serving, voluntarily or involuntarily, as human shields? Finally, when should killing civilians constitute a war crime? These are the questions that Law and Morality at War answers, contributing to a cutting-edge international debate. \r\n\r\n---\r\n <a href=\"\nhttp://dlfeb.com/book/law-and-morality-at-war-oxford-legal-philosophy/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttp://dlfeb.com/book/law-and-morality-at-war-oxford-legal-philosophy/</a>","last_updated":"2017-07-23T12:01:24.823Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e5c0aaf9fcf778db1f6b2d8079fe746d3efd2ee","dn":"LAW AND MORALITY AT WAR ","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"0e5c0aaf9fcf778db1f6b2d8079fe746d3efd2ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,92,10,175,159,207,119,141,177,246,178,216,7,159,231,70,211,239,210,238]},"name":"LAW AND MORALITY AT WAR ","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
