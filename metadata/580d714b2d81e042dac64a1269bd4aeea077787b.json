But not the case now and especially not when the pianist in question is John Blum and the group is trombonist Steve Swell&apos;s Slammin&apos; The Infinite. Underground legend Blum stays on board for their fourth outing after his guest appearance on Live At The Vision Festival (Not Two, 2008) and it pays dividends.\r\nAlthough a studio date, the fulsome 76-minute playing time permits a stretching out as if in performance. Part of Slammin&apos;s appeal lies in the trademark simultaneous blowing by Sabir Mateen&apos;s mellifluous reeds, ever ready to spiral beyond the treble clef into stratospheric falsetto, and the leader&apos;s rough-hewn yet finely nuanced trombone, bolstered now by Blum&apos;s careening piano. Even when not soloing the pianist&apos;s controlled abandon demands attention. On bass, Matt Heyner breathes life into riffs, quickly deconstructed once ingrained on the listener&apos;s consciousness and plots more abstract musings with bow in hand while drummer Klaus Kugel drives the ensembles yet also explores texture, as in his shimmering feature on &quot;The Darkness Afoot.&quot;... - John Sharpe, All About Jazz","last_updated":"2017-04-23T18:00:25.571Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:580d714b2d81e042dac64a1269bd4aeea077787b","dn":"Steve Swell's Slammin' The Infinite 2009 5000 Poems","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"580d714b2d81e042dac64a1269bd4aeea077787b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,13,113,75,45,129,224,66,218,198,74,18,105,189,74,238,160,119,120,123]},"name":"Steve Swell's Slammin' The Infinite 2009 5000 Poems","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
