Hemmed in by overwhelming Nazi strength, the 338,000 men gathered on the beach were all that stood between Hitler and Western Europe. Crush them, and the path to Paris and London was clear.\r\nUnable to retreat any farther, the Allied soldiers set up defense positions and prayed for deliverance. Prime Minister Winston Churchill ordered an evacuation on May 26, expecting to save no more than a handful of his men. But Britain would not let its soldiers down. Hundreds of fishing boats, pleasure yachts, and commercial vessels streamed into the Channel to back up the Royal Navy, and in a week nearly the entire army was ferried safely back to England.\r\nBased on interviews with hundreds of survivors and told by &#x201C;a master narrator,&#x201D; The Miracle of Dunkirk is a striking history of a week when the outcome of World War II hung in the balance (Arthur Schlesinger Jr.).\r\n\r\nAbout the Author\r\nWalter Lord (1917&#x2013;2002) was an acclaimed and bestselling author of literary nonfiction best known for his gripping and meticulously researched accounts of watershed historical events. Born in Baltimore, Lord went to work for the Office of Strategic Services during World War II. After the war&#x2019;s end, Lord joined a New York advertising firm, and began writing nonfiction in his spare time. His first book was The Fremantle Diary (1954), a volume of Civil War diaries that became a surprising success. But it was Lord&#x2019;s next book, A Night to Remember (1955), that made him famous. The bestseller caused a new flurry of interest in the Titanic and inspired the 1958 film of the same name. Lord went on to use the book&#x2019;s interview-heavy format as a template for most of his following works, which included detailed reconstructions of the Pearl Harbor attack in Day of Infamy (1957), the battle of Midway in Incredible Victory (1967), and the integration of the University of Mississippi in The Past That Would Not Die (1965). In all, he published a dozen books.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\nList of Maps\r\nForeword\r\n1 The Closing Trap\r\n2 No. 17 Turns Up\r\n3 &#x201C;Operation Dynamo&#x201D;\r\n4 Buying Time\r\n5 &#x201C;Plenty Troops, Few Boats&#x201D;\r\n6 The Gap\r\n7 Torpedoes in the Night\r\n8 Assault from the Sky\r\n9 The Little Ships\r\n10 &#x201C;Bras-Dessus, Bras-Dessus!&#x201D;\r\n11 Holding the Perimeter\r\n12 &#x201C;I Have Never Prayed So Hard Before&#x201D;\r\n13 &#x201C;BEF Evacuated&#x201D;\r\n14 The Last Night\r\n15 Deliverance\r\nWritten Source Material\r\nAcknowledgements\r\nList of Contributors\r\nIndex\r\nImage Gallery\r\n <a href=\"\nhttps://s1.postimg.org/711dr98xb/The_Miracle_of_Dunkirk_-_The_True_Story_of_Opera.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://s1.postimg.org/711dr98xb/The_Miracle_of_Dunkirk_-_The_True_Story_of_Opera.jpg</a>","last_updated":"2017-08-08T12:02:13.803Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5a019e656218641c89958c1e392ddb1fcf13e42","dn":"The Miracle of Dunkirk - The True Story of Operation Dynamo (gnv","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"f5a019e656218641c89958c1e392ddb1fcf13e42","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,160,25,230,86,33,134,65,200,153,88,193,227,146,221,177,252,241,62,66]},"name":"The Miracle of Dunkirk - The True Story of Operation Dynamo (gnv","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
