But on a remote island off the coast of Co. Mayo, it has a louder voice. Along with reports of incoming Atlantic storms, the local radio station runs a thrice daily roll call of ordinary deaths. The islanders go in great numbers, often with young children, to wake with their dead. They keep the corpse and the bereaved company through the long hours of the night. They dig the grave with their own hands. It is a communal triumph in overcoming the death of the individual.\r\n\r\nIn this beautifully written memoir, Kevin Toolis gives an intimate eyewitness account of the death and wake of his father and explores the wider history of the Irish wake. With an uplifting, positive message at its heart, My Father&apos;s Wake celebrates the spiritual depth of the Irish wake and asks if we can find a better way to deal with our mortality by living and loving in the acceptance of death.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-04-10T17:24:53.020Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd5abf37c40a5aa59f04e933b4ce8e0a8e7c9655","dn":"My Father's Wake by Kevin Toolis EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"dd5abf37c40a5aa59f04e933b4ce8e0a8e7c9655","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,90,191,55,196,10,90,165,159,4,233,51,180,206,142,10,142,124,150,85]},"name":"My Father's Wake by Kevin Toolis EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
