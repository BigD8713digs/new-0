Block Island is the second busiest airport in the state of Rhode Island owing to the heavy general aviation and air taxi traffic it receives during the summer vacation season. The island is just 13 miles offshore from mainland Rhode Island and can be reached by a New England Airlines BN-2 Twin Islander in just 12 minutes. Featuring entire photoreal coverage of Block Island in 35cm resolution, there are many points of interest to explore. Lighthouses, harbors, beaches, bluffs, and windfarms are all a short flight away, along with close proximity to other coastal New England airports such as Nantucket and Martha&apos;s Vineyard","last_updated":"2018-03-19T12:06:25.804Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:684f4b0b41616790b70de7b1ccc1c2412869287b","dn":"[FSX/P3D/P3DV4] ORBX KBID Block Island State Airport v1.05 RIP","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"684f4b0b41616790b70de7b1ccc1c2412869287b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,79,75,11,65,97,103,144,183,13,231,177,204,193,194,65,40,105,40,123]},"name":"[FSX/P3D/P3DV4] ORBX KBID Block Island State Airport v1.05 RIP","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
