Psychology plays a huge role within the game: heroes and enemies are atypical and the line between good and evil is blurred.\r\n The development of the game is similar to that of a film narration, \r\nwhere the player perfectly identifies himself with the character. The \r\nsoundtrack, composed by Nobuko Toda (Final Fantasy, Halo, Metal Gear Solid) and Luca Balboni, enhances the terrifying atmosphere of the game.Rosemary Reed, a fascinating 35 year old woman, reaches the house of a retired notary, Dr. Felton, who is affected by a mysterious disease.\r\n The woman is greeted by Ms. Gloria, the nurse who takes care of the old\r\n man. When Rosemary reveals herself and her true intentions, the terrifying dread begins.Rosemary&#x2019;s investigations will bring her to believe that the disappearance of the man&#x2019;s daughter Celeste actually hides a terrible massacre","last_updated":"2017-07-02T12:05:37.726Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:edba2a7027b4b5359ae66450a059452736b7eacf","dn":"Remothered: Tormented Fathers Beta","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"edba2a7027b4b5359ae66450a059452736b7eacf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,186,42,112,39,180,181,53,154,230,100,80,160,89,69,39,54,183,234,207]},"name":"Remothered: Tormented Fathers Beta","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
