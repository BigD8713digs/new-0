For years, they lurked in shadows. For years, they struck from the dark. Kidnapping us. Torturing us. Studying us.Now they unleash their full fury.Thousands of their saucers attack Earth. Our armies crumble. Earth burns.Yet from the fire, heroes rise. Marco Emery. Addy Linden. Einav Ben-Ari. Names everyone on Earth knows. The names of legends. Names now whispered as a prayer.Around the heroes, humanity will rally. Under their leadership, we will fight. Together we can win.The grays think us weak. But we will stand strong!","last_updated":"2018-01-02T12:06:39.130Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc8dd05e627994321fdb46d901f5dd85db9d5065","dn":"Daniel Arenson - Earth Honor Earthrise","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"fc8dd05e627994321fdb46d901f5dd85db9d5065","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,141,208,94,98,121,148,50,31,219,70,217,1,245,221,133,219,157,80,101]},"name":"Daniel Arenson - Earth Honor Earthrise","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
