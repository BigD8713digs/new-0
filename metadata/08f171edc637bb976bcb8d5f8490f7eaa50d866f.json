Today, she has dedicated her life to saving other young women from the hell that almost killed her&#x2014;first as an officer of the law, then by stepping outside the law and into the darkness where true evil dwells.

This time, when he learns that Bella is working undercover to find a missing girl involved in a dangerous prostitution ring, JT asks FBI Special Agent Lucy Kincaid for help.\r\n\r\nEven with Lucy&apos;s extensive experience in running down human traffickers, finding Bella will not be easy.
