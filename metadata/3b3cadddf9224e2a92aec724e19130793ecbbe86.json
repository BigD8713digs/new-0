S. Government officials, including ambassadors. Lower ranking employees and ex- employees of government, however, are often targeted, especially &#x201C;whistleblowers&#x201D; and those discontented with the status quo.\r\n\r\nPostal workers very often become targets, which very well may explain the shooting sprees and rampages of some of those employees.\r\n\r\n(2) High ranking state-level officials.\r\n\r\n(3) The clergy, although members of Fundamentalist Protestant and Roman Catholic churches often become targets.\r\n\r\nSome of those victims complain that their churches may be involved in their harassment.\r\n\r\n(4) Law enforcement officers.\r\n\r\nAlthough I have heard obliquely of police officers being electronically assaulted, I have never actually corresponded with or read a complaint by a law enforcement target.\r\n\r\nThe exclusion also applies to prison authorities, U. S. marshals, Border Patrol, DEA, the entire U. S. intelligence community, including the Secret Service, sheriffs, and sheriff&#x2019;s deputies.\r\n\r\n(5) CEOs and very successful businesspersons.\r\n\r\n(6) High ranking military officials.\r\n\r\nEnlisted personnel are often targets; however, I have never seen any material about officer-level personnel having been targeted.\r\n\r\n(7) The medical community.\r\n\r\n(8) The wealthy.\r\n\r\nI have never read anything about a millionaire having been victimized by ESMC.\r\n\r\nMost of the targets are middle-class workers, small business owners, retirees, and sometimes financially and socially-marginal persons.\r\n\r\n(9) Judges and lawyers","last_updated":"2018-01-28T12:04:34.818Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b3cadddf9224e2a92aec724e19130793ecbbe86","dn":"Max H.
