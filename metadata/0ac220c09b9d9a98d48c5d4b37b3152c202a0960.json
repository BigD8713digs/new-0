Perhaps this leader has been you. Why does this happen, in spite of the leader&apos;s vision, talent, and emotional intelligence?\r\n\r\nRichard Boyatzis and Annie McKee, co-authors, with Daniel Goleman, of the international best-seller Primal Leadership, argue that today&apos;s leaders face unprecedented challenges that result in a vicious cycle of stress and sacrifice, with little or no recovery time built in. Consequently, even the most resonant leaders, whose ability to deftly manage their own and others&apos; emotions once drove their companies to greatness, end up spiraling into dissonance.\r\n\r\nIn this new book, Boyatzis and McKee marshal decades of multidisciplinary research and hands-on consulting work to provide a practical framework for how leaders can create and sustain resonance in their relationships, their teams, and their organizations. To counter the inevitable &quot;power stress&quot; of the leadership role, leaders must consciously manage the &quot;Cycle of Sacrifice and Renewal&quot; by stepping out of destructive patterns and renewing themselves physically, mentally, and emotionally. Through vivid examples, the authors show how three key elements - mindfulness, hope, and compassion - are essential to enabling renewal and sustaining resonance.\r\n\r\nLeaders can&apos;t sustain effectiveness if they can&apos;t sustain themselves. Resonant Leadership offers inspiration, dozens of exercises, and other tools to help readers become and remain successful leaders in their work and in their lives.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-06-03T12:01:09.684Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ac220c09b9d9a98d48c5d4b37b3152c202a0960","dn":"Resonant Leadership by Richard Boyatzis, Annie McKee EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"0ac220c09b9d9a98d48c5d4b37b3152c202a0960","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,194,32,192,155,157,154,152,212,140,93,75,55,179,21,44,32,42,9,96]},"name":"Resonant Leadership by Richard Boyatzis, Annie McKee EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
