Their trainer is the fearless Anton, whose work demands absolute fitness and the steadiest of nerves. When Anton is found lying dead in the tigers&apos; cage, it seems that he has lost control and been mauled by the tigers - but Detective Inspector Minto of Scotland Yard is not convinced.\r\n\r\nMinto&apos;s investigations lead him deep into the circus world of tents and caravans, clowns and acrobats, human and animal performers. No one is above suspicion. Carey, the circus owner with a secret to hide; Dodo, the clown whose costume is scratched as if by a claw; and Lorimer, the trapeze artist jealous of his flirtatious wife - all come under Minto&apos;s scrutiny as the mystery deepens.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-09-02T12:02:14.514Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:3960a23694ff9fc572e19f4c5a984c6593d1c9fe","dn":"Death of Anton by Alan Melville EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"3960a23694ff9fc572e19f4c5a984c6593d1c9fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,96,162,54,148,255,159,197,114,225,159,76,90,152,76,101,147,209,201,254]},"name":"Death of Anton by Alan Melville EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
