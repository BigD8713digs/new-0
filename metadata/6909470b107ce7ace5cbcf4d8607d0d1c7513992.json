Hence, it is considered to be the building blocks of web development. Thus, if you are planning to be a web developer, especially front end web developer, learning html an css is a must. Moreover, since CSS literally requires no coding skill and knowing CSS can be an amazing tool to have in one&#x2019;s skill-set.\r\n\r\nI have tried to prepare this book as a CSS guide for beginners where CSS version 3 (CSS3) is considered. Therefore, if knowing CSS3 has been on your to-do list, why don&#x2019;t you take thirty minutes and read the book. However, since CSS is used to style HTML tag based web content, I have also discussed on HTML and HTML tags in the first chapter. Hence, those having fundamentals on HTML or even no understanding of HTML, this book can be a great help to start playing with CSS3.\r\n\r\nSimilar to web design for dummies, this book titled CSS for dummies aims to be a good resource for any beginner in web development industry. I hope you will enjoy this journey.\r\n\r\nThe ToC is as follows,\r\n\r\nChapter 1: Getting Started with HTML\r\nChapter 2: Getting Started with CSS\r\nChapter 3: Scratch Page Layout\r\nChapter 4: The Box Model\r\nChapter 5: HTML and CSS Scripts","last_updated":"2017-08-06T12:00:24.764Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:6909470b107ce7ace5cbcf4d8607d0d1c7513992","dn":"CSS for Dummies - Learn CSS 3.0 in 30 Minutes - 1E (2017) Gooner","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"6909470b107ce7ace5cbcf4d8607d0d1c7513992","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,9,71,11,16,124,231,172,229,203,207,77,134,7,208,209,199,81,57,146]},"name":"CSS for Dummies - Learn CSS 3.0 in 30 Minutes - 1E (2017) Gooner","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
