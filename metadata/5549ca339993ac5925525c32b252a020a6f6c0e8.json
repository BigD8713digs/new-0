As Bayek of Siwa, who is simultaneously compassionate, bold, and driven by revenge, you&#x2019;re strung through a twisted story of pharaohs and corrupt leaders, of love gained and lost, and the plights of the lower class in a time when they were routinely worked to death and nobody batted an eye. It&#x2019;s a tense journey that challenges your concepts of right and wrong, making you consider the morality of those you kill in the process &#x2013; and, in a dramatic shift for the series, it&#x2019;s all part of a full-on roleplaying game. \r\n\r\nI spent 30 hours finishing the main campaign, which took me through just over half of the expansive and beautiful map that recreates ancient Egypt&#x2019;s varied architecture and environments. It&#x2019;s filled with areas of soft sand that are swept by dynamic sandstorms, ranges of treacherous and rocky mountains, catacombs of towering ancient structures built in the names of the gods, and the decaying shacks of the common people. Refreshingly, I discovered all of these things through an organic drive to explore, rather than through the series&#x2019; traditional structure of climbing to viewpoints to have them unveiled for you. There are plenty more secrets to uncover, and the delightful sense of discovery still hasn&#x2019;t left me","last_updated":"2017-12-22T12:05:09.357Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:5549ca339993ac5925525c32b252a020a6f6c0e8","dn":"Assassin's Creed Origins CPY.v1.10","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"5549ca339993ac5925525c32b252a020a6f6c0e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,73,202,51,153,147,172,89,37,82,92,50,178,82,160,32,166,246,192,232]},"name":"Assassin's Creed Origins CPY.v1.10","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
