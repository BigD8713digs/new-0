Terry\r\nQuintessence Publishing | January 2017 | ISBN-10: 0867156686 | True PDF | 292 pages | 308 mb\r\n\r\nThis book showcases the many applications of next-generation flowable composites and presents each of them in step-by-step fashion. With the adhesive design concept and the injectable resin composite technique, these flowable composites can expand dental treatment options, improve precision and predictability, and reduce chair time. Clinical applications include anterior and posterior composite restorations; pediatric crowns; bonding indirect restorations; developing the ovate pontic site; eliminating cervical tooth sensitivity; enhancing internal adaptation; immediate dentin sealing; provisional fabrication, modification, and repair; rebonding the fractured ceramic restoration; repairing fractured denture teeth; tooth splinting; developing a post and core; developing the functional composite prototype; mandibular anterior composite veneers; and restoring form and function, among others. The early chapters describe the evolution of flowable resin composites and the science underpinning the adhesive design concept, and the later chapters are divided into case presentations of the many applications of this concept. Each case presentation includes the various adhesive preparation designs, restorative techniques, adhesive protocols, and finishing procedures involved. By using the right materials and protocols with this adhesive design concept, you will be able to develop natural-looking restorations while providing superior treatment to your patients.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n1.
