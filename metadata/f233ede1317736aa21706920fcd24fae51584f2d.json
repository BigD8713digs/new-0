And of course Live.. here is a memory of the pit (Not Mosh)...It was HOT and WET ( they kept spraying the hose on us). I was on my feet for  12 hours near the stage. You couldn&#x2019;t leave and  get back. I was one of the mud people. They showed this on MTV. I could have been on TV because I was down front where the cameras were  I left sunburned and tired.
