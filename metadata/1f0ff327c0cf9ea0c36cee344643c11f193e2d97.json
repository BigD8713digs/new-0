And in a scientific first, the complete story inside a single turtle nest is revealed, using recent scientific discoveries and the latest technological advances. An egg-to-egg turtle talk is listened in on, adult females on their migration are tracked, and behaviour under the waves is analysed with a turtle shell-mounted camera. How tiny turtles behave as they hatch out of their shells and work together to dig upwards is also revealed.\r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC High L3.1\r\n * Video Bitrate: CRF 20 (~2491Kbps)\r\n * Video Resolution: 1280x720\r\n * Frame Rate: 25 FPS\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC-LC\r\n * Audio Bitrate: Q=0.45 VBR 48KHz (~144Kbps)\r\n * Audio Channels: 2\r\n * Run-Time: 89 mins\r\n * Part Size: 1.64 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Subtitles: Merged","last_updated":"2018-06-30T12:09:43.807Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f0ff327c0cf9ea0c36cee344643c11f193e2d97","dn":"BBC Natures Turtle Nursery Secrets from the Nest 720p x264 AAC H","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"1f0ff327c0cf9ea0c36cee344643c11f193e2d97","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,15,243,39,192,207,158,160,195,108,238,52,70,67,193,31,25,62,45,151]},"name":"BBC Natures Turtle Nursery Secrets from the Nest 720p x264 AAC H","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
