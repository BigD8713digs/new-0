How does living change when we realize we&apos;re not invincible? Does knowing our likely fate make it harder or easier to face the future? How do you motivate yourself to go on your OkCupid date when you&apos;re struggling with your own mortality? \r\n\r\nWritten in her inimitable, wry and insightful voice, Jean Hannah Edelstein&apos;s memoir is by turns heart-breaking, hopeful and yet also disarmingly funny. This Really Isn&apos;t About You is a book about finding your way in life. Which is to say, it&apos;s a book about discovering you are not really in control of that at all.\r\n\r\nGenre: Non-Fiction &gt; Biographies &amp; Memoirs","last_updated":"2018-09-21T12:24:51.081Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:00f0c2bf2d3dae07e2018976e3b0dbd9a4a216c3","dn":"This Really Isn't About You by Jean Hannah Edelstein(.epub)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"00f0c2bf2d3dae07e2018976e3b0dbd9a4a216c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,240,194,191,45,61,174,7,226,1,137,118,227,176,219,217,164,162,22,195]},"name":"This Really Isn't About You by Jean Hannah Edelstein(.epub)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
