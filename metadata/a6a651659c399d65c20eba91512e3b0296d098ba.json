Using a unique life history approach, the book moves from pregnancy and birth through to senescence. Drawing on biological data gathered from human remains, as well as cultural and environmental data derived from archaeological investigations, the authors provide  students with a wealth of information on health and other aspects of life that leave changes on the skeletal system. Rich case studies throughout demonstrate the temporal, cultural and environmental variability across the continent prior to colonial times. The authors also examine how different groups faced a variety of challenges in their lives, including climate change and violence, and the effects this had on their health. The book concludes by considering the relevance of what ancient bones reveal for people today. Written in an engaging style, with complex paleopathology data synthesized and clearly presented,  Bodies and Lives in Ancient America is an accessible introduction to the state of health across prehistoric North America.\r\n\r\n---\r\n <a href=\"\nhttp://dlfeb.com/book/bodies-and-lives-in-ancient-america-health-before-columbus/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttp://dlfeb.com/book/bodies-and-lives-in-ancient-america-health-before-columbus/</a>","last_updated":"2017-07-22T12:04:08.416Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:a6a651659c399d65c20eba91512e3b0296d098ba","dn":"BODIES AND LIVES IN ANCIENT AMERICA","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"a6a651659c399d65c20eba91512e3b0296d098ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,166,81,101,156,57,157,101,194,14,186,145,81,46,59,2,150,208,152,186]},"name":"BODIES AND LIVES IN ANCIENT AMERICA","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
