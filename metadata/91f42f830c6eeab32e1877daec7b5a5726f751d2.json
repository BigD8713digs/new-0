In 2013, Dr. Kermit Gosnell was convicted of killing four people, including three babies, but is thought to have killed hundreds, perhaps thousands more in a 30-year killing spree. ABC News correspondent Terry Moran described Gosnell as &quot;America&apos;s most prolific serial killer&quot;. Gosnell is currently serving three life sentences (without the possibility of parole) for murdering babies and patients at his &quot;House of Horrors&quot; abortion clinic.\r\n\r\nThis book - and now a major movie starring Dean Cain (Lois &amp; Clarke) - reveals how the investigation that brought Gosnell to justice started as a routine drugs investigation and turned into a shocking unmasking of America&apos;s biggest serial killer. It details how compliant politicians and bureaucrats allowed Dr. Gosnell to carry out his grisly trade because they didn&apos;t want to be accused of &quot;attacking abortion&quot;. Gosnell also exposes the media cover-up that saw reporters refusing to cover a story that shone an unwelcome spotlight on abortion in America in the 21st century. Gosnell is an astounding piece of investigative journalism revealing a cover-up among the medical political and media establishments that allowed a killer to go undetected for decades.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-07-12T12:00:33.563Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:91f42f830c6eeab32e1877daec7b5a5726f751d2","dn":"Ann McElhinney - Gosnell 2017 RETAiL ePUB eBOOK-DiSTRiBUTiON","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"91f42f830c6eeab32e1877daec7b5a5726f751d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,244,47,131,12,110,234,179,46,24,119,218,236,123,90,87,38,247,81,210]},"name":"Ann McElhinney - Gosnell 2017 RETAiL ePUB eBOOK-DiSTRiBUTiON","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
