Keenly observed and written with his insightful and deadpan sense of humor, Bragg explores enduring Southern truths about home, place, spirit, table, and the regions&apos; varied geographies, including his native Alabama, Cajun country, and the Gulf Coast. Everything is explored, from regional obsessions with college football and fishing to mayonnaise and spoonbread to the simple beauty of a fish on the hook. Collected from over a decade of his writing, with many never-before-published essays written specifically for this edition, My Southern Journey is an entertaining and engaging read, especially for Southerners (or Southerners at heart) and anyone who appreciates great writing.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-01-31T12:00:42.437Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:6fcfdb5416a592145b4d3a689ce0605126a87490","dn":"My Southern Journey by Rick Bragg EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"6fcfdb5416a592145b4d3a689ce0605126a87490","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,207,219,84,22,165,146,20,91,77,58,104,156,224,96,81,38,168,116,144]},"name":"My Southern Journey by Rick Bragg EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
