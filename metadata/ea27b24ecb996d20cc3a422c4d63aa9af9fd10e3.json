The documentary follows Felix as he underwent years of training under the watchful eye of 82-year-old colonel Joe Kittinger, the man who set the original record when he fell 19 miles to Earth (102,000 feet) 50 years ago, since which two men died in similar attempts.\r\nDuring Felix&apos;s intense physical training, the cameras capture the basejumper as he struggles to overcome a severe claustrophic reaction to the movement-restricting pressure suit, and how the mission came close to aborting in the final stages of the ascent, and saw just how close Felix came to spinning and tumbling to unconsciousness during the jump.\r\n\r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n\r\n * Video Container: mkv\r\n * Video Bitrate: 6955 kb/s\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\n * Video Resolution: 1920x1080\r\n * Frame Rate: 50 FPS\r\n * Audio Codec: AC-3\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 192 kb/s\r\n * Audio Channels: 2\r\n * Run-Time: 1h 28 mins\r\n * Number of Parts: 1\r\n * Part Size: 4.42 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV","last_updated":"2017-12-06T12:03:06.324Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea27b24ecb996d20cc3a422c4d63aa9af9fd10e3","dn":"BB Dive 2012 1080i HDTV docuindex","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"ea27b24ecb996d20cc3a422c4d63aa9af9fd10e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,39,178,78,203,153,109,32,204,58,66,44,77,99,170,154,249,253,16,227]},"name":"BB Dive 2012 1080i HDTV docuindex","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
