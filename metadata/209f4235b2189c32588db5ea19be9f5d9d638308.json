He had a significant influence on many of the American literary movements of the 1950s, including the Beat movement, the San Francisco Renaissance, the Black Mountain school, and the New York School.\n\nWilliams was briefly involved in the Imagist movement through his friendships with Ezra Pound and H.D., but soon began to develop opinions that differed from theirs and his style changed to express his commitment to a modernist expression of his immediate environment.  Continuing to experiment with new techniques of meter and lineation, Williams saw his poetic project as a singularly American one and worked to invent an entirely fresh and uniquely American form of poetry whose subject matter centred on everyday circumstances of life and the lives of common people.\n\nIn his modernist epic collage PATERSON (1946-1958), an account of the history, people, and essence of Paterson, New Jersey, Williams wrote his own modern epic poem, focusing on &quot;the local&quot; on a wider scale than he had previously attempted.  He also examined the role of the poet in American society and famously summarized his poetic method in the phrase &quot;No ideas but in things&quot;.  In 1963 he was posthumously awarded the Pulitzer Prize in poetry for his PICTURES FROM BRUEGHEL &amp; OTHER POEMS (1962).\n\nIn addition to poetry, Williams was also a prolific writer of prose, including essays, fiction, and plays.  IN THE AMERICAN GRAIN (1925) analyzed the American character and culture through essays on historical figures.  He wrote several novels, two of which are included here.  Among his notable short stories are &#x201C;Jean Beicke,&#x201D; &#x201C;A Face of Stone,&#x201D; and &#x201C;The Farmers&#x2019; Daughters.&#x201D;  His play &quot;A Dream of Love&quot; (1948) was produced in off-Broadway and academic theatres, and his AUTOBIOGRAPHY appeared in 1951.\n\n\nThe following books are in ePUB and/or PDF format as noted:\n\n\n                               == POETRY ==\n\n* Al Que Quiere!
