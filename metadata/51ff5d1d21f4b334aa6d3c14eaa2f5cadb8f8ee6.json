Braden&apos;s compositions and arrangements are filled with harmonic and rhythmic twists and turns that make the music fresh, especially where the entire sextet is featured. Braden&apos;s &quot;Father Time&quot; begins with a brief collective improvisation that segues into a medium-fast groove. Braden&apos;s arrangement of &quot;When You Wish Upon a Star&quot; is characterized by numerous shifts between 3/4 and 4/4 throughout the piece, which gives it a different flavor. Braden&apos;s &quot;Mr C.M.B.,&quot; a dedication to McBride, begins with Harrell and Turre playing a medium-fast melody in 4/4 that&apos;s reminiscent of &quot;Mr. P.C.,&quot; with Braden answering them in the slower 3/4 middle section, with all the horns joining in on the final section. Duke Ellington&apos;s &quot;Sophisticated Lady,&quot; normally played as a ballad, is transformed into finger poppin&apos; swing, while the standard &quot;Falling in Love With Love&quot; is taken at a much faster tempo than usual. Braden&apos;s distinctive tenor sound and improvisational ideas stand out throughout this recording, as does McBride&apos;s big-toned bass and Allen&apos;s dynamic drumming. This is one of 1993&apos;s best releases, and is a great step in Braden&apos;s rapid development. - Greg Turner, AMG","last_updated":"2017-06-10T12:01:01.735Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:51ff5d1d21f4b334aa6d3c14eaa2f5cadb8f8ee6","dn":"Don Braden Sextet 1993 Wish List","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"51ff5d1d21f4b334aa6d3c14eaa2f5cadb8f8ee6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,255,93,29,33,244,179,52,170,109,60,20,234,162,245,202,219,143,142,230]},"name":"Don Braden Sextet 1993 Wish List","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
