They arrive at a moon, LV-223, located trillions of miles away from Earth. \r\n\r\nThe team spot what they believe to be signs of civilization. They go to investigate and find more than just signs... They find conclusive evidence. But some of the crew, including the android, David, have ulterior motives for being there. \r\n\r\nThey believe that this is where the human race actually came from. Things soon turn from excitement to survival and terror once inside their discovery.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThis version is the ultimate extended fan edit of &quot;Prometheus,&quot; which includes deleted scenes and dialogue.
