Life was beautiful and bright, and every day soared with music.\r\n\r\nNow\r\n\r\nIngrid is on a summertime wilderness survival trek for at-risk teens: addicts, runaways, and her. She&apos;s fighting to survive crushing humiliations, physical challenges that push her to her limits, and mind games that threaten to break her.\r\n\r\nThen\r\n\r\nWhen the curtain fell on Margot-Sophia&apos;s singing career, they buried the past and settled into a small, painfully normal life.
