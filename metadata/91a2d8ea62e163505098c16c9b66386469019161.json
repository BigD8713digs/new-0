He also says that if women\r\ngive him &quot;any trouble&quot; he thinks it right to simply &quot;pin their wings to the floor&quot;\r\n(So much cor such thinking in this regard anymore - I doubt Don Murray could sell\r\nthat advice today even if its how some choose to operate even now perhaps)\r\n\r\nThe Spirit of Marilyn Monroe is too special to be preached to by Don Murray&apos;s character who quotes to her from the &quot;American constitution&quot; that &quot;all men are... (supposedly) &quot;...created equal&quot; If that were true we&apos;d all be married to Marilyn Monroe as that is who every gal would be in truth. Well, perhaps in some ideal\r\nsort of utopian world we might just make future all we&apos;d have are merited men, and a billion Marilyn Monroe&apos;s to keep them happy, even if many of these gals choose\r\nto work in bars like the gal in this movie doing what she chooses to do for them.\r\nwe can only hope I suppose - we&apos;ll see!\r\n\r\nSeed kindly if you please - with thanks indeed\r\n\r\nMichael Rizzo Chessman\r\n(moviesbyrizzo)","last_updated":"2018-10-13T12:06:09.515Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:91a2d8ea62e163505098c16c9b66386469019161","dn":"Bus Stop (1956) Ms Marilyn Monroe 1080p H.264 (moviesbyrizzo)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"91a2d8ea62e163505098c16c9b66386469019161","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,162,216,234,98,225,99,80,80,152,193,108,155,102,56,100,105,1,145,97]},"name":"Bus Stop (1956) Ms Marilyn Monroe 1080p H.264 (moviesbyrizzo)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
