The following year, Raven would combine Aladdin and Dinner Music on one disc. \r\nNot only do the original albums deserve to be released separately, but both the BGP and Raven reissue two-fers ruin the strange sleeve artwork that adorned the original LPs. Songs/Hey Love looks particularly horrid, with an orgy of rainbow colors that bleed into each other. Charly once issued Songs on its own, but as of 2003, this combination was the only way to obtain Hey Love on CD. \r\nDespite these problems, it might be a dirty secret that these two albums on one disc make for a great introduction to the group.
