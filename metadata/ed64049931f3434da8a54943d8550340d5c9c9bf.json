Its inhabitants are people who were plucked from 20th-century history at various times and places and left to govern themselves, advised by Mentors whose purpose seems inscrutable.\r\n\r\nThis is life in the Experiment. Andrei Voronin, a young astronomer plucked from Leningrad in the 1950s, is a die-hard believer in the Experiment, even though his first job in the city is as a garbage collector. As increasingly nightmarish scenarios begin to affect the city, he rises through the political hierarchy, with devastating effect.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-12-26T12:05:09.661Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed64049931f3434da8a54943d8550340d5c9c9bf","dn":"The Doomed City by Arkady Strugatsky, Boris Strugatsky EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"ed64049931f3434da8a54943d8550340d5c9c9bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,100,4,153,49,243,67,77,168,165,73,67,216,85,3,64,213,201,201,191]},"name":"The Doomed City by Arkady Strugatsky, Boris Strugatsky EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
