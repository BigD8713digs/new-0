To crack each level, you&apos;ll need to figure out the right sequence of interactions to bring each coloured piece together, changing the cell structure by breaking open walls or creating new divisions. You&apos;ll need to unlock resources then use catalysts to create the compounds you need. As you progress, new and unusual elements emerge and combine together inside shifting cell structures to challenge your lateral thinking","last_updated":"2017-08-03T12:00:13.064Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:4167b2c3c2c75cb2154314fd2b3507c03a3595fd","dn":"Tricone Lab","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"4167b2c3c2c75cb2154314fd2b3507c03a3595fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,103,178,195,194,199,92,178,21,67,20,253,43,53,7,192,58,53,149,253]},"name":"Tricone Lab","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
