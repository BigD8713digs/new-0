With his self-deprecating humor and charm, he has won over hundreds of thousands of followers who come to him for both encouragement and a kick in the pants. Now, after showing you how to reboot your career in his New York Times best seller Do Over, Acuff shows chronic starters how to actually finish their goals in an age of bottomless distractions and endless opportunities.\r\n\r\nAcuff knows the reason why many writers&apos; novels go unfinished - it&apos;s the same reason why gyms are filled in the first week of January and empty by the end of the month and why people stop learning a new language once they get past the easy parts. It&apos;s not just that people lose momentum or get distracted. People give up on projects when they fail to live up to their own high expectations and decide that if they can&apos;t do something perfectly, they won&apos;t do it at all. If you&apos;re going to finish, you have to kill perfectionism.\r\n\r\nDrawing on his popular 30 Days of Hustle course, Acuff teaches readers to short-circuit perfectionism and make it through to the end of a task. Whether it&apos;s by &quot;choosing what to bomb&quot; or &quot;cutting a goal in half&quot;, he shows readers how to move past &quot;the day after perfect&quot;, get focused, and - finally - finish.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-09-17T12:04:03.108Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e5621e126bb2f23c20a0d28dfc81e50ca2ba494","dn":"Finish_ Give Yourself the Gift of Done by Jon Acuff ePUB eBOOK-Z","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"6e5621e126bb2f23c20a0d28dfc81e50ca2ba494","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,86,33,225,38,187,47,35,194,10,13,40,223,200,30,80,202,43,164,148]},"name":"Finish_ Give Yourself the Gift of Done by Jon Acuff ePUB eBOOK-Z","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
