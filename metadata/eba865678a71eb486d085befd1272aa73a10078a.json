It may work on MacOS as well, but it&apos;s only tested with Crossover v16.2.0 for Linux.\r\n\r\n&quot;Fallout 2: A Post Nuclear Role Playing Game is a role-playing open world video game developed by Black Isle Studios and published by Interplay in September 1998. While featuring a considerably larger game world and a far more extensive storyline, it largely uses similar graphics and game mechanics to those of Fallout.\r\nThe game&apos;s story takes place in 2241, 80 years after the events of Fallout and 164 years after the war. It tells the story of the original hero&apos;s descendant and their quest to save their primitive tribe from starvation by finding an ancient environmental restoration machine known as the Garden of Eden Creation Kit (GECK).\r\nThe game was well received by critics, with praise directed at the gameplay, storyline and worthiness as a successor to the original Fallout, while criticism was directed at the frequent bugs and lack of improvement over the first game.&quot;\r\n <a href=\"\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_2\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_2</a>","last_updated":"2017-05-24T11:44:00.390Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:eba865678a71eb486d085befd1272aa73a10078a","dn":"Fallout.2.1998.Crossover.Linux-Ecclesiast","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"eba865678a71eb486d085befd1272aa73a10078a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,168,101,103,138,113,235,72,109,8,91,239,209,39,42,167,58,16,7,138]},"name":"Fallout.2.1998.Crossover.Linux-Ecclesiast","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
