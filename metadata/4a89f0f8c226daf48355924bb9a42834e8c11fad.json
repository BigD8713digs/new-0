The original air date for this was 12-09-2017.\r\nThe episode features a interview with artist Alex Cross and a lot of old Sven skits because the films running time is about an hour.\r\n\r\nEnjoy and requests are Welcome !! Unfortunately, Pirate Bay doesn&apos;t have a notification system for messages, so yours may go unread for some time.
