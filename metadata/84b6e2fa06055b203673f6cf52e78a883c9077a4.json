Much of this research will be transferred to the private sector to aid in product development and the improvement of protective measures against cyber warfare attacks. This research is not widely publicized. There are initiatives to coordinate these research efforts but there has never been a published comprehensive analysis of the content and direction of the numerous research programs. This book provides private sector developers, investors, and security planners with insight into the direction of the U.S. Government research efforts on cybersecurity.Michael Erbschloe has worked for over 30 years performing analysis of the economics of information technology, public policy relating to technology, and utilizing technology in reengineering organization processes. He has authored several books on social and management issues of information technology most of which covered some aspects of information or corporate security. I have also taught at several universities and developed technology-related curriculum. His career has focused on several interrelated areas: technology strategy, analysis, and forecasting; teaching and curriculum development; writing books and articles; speaking at conferences and industry events; publishing and editing; and public policy analysis and program evaluation","last_updated":"2018-07-11T12:09:18.409Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:84b6e2fa06055b203673f6cf52e78a883c9077a4","dn":"Threat Level Red: Cybersecurity Research Programs of the U.S. Go","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"84b6e2fa06055b203673f6cf52e78a883c9077a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,182,226,250,6,5,91,32,54,115,246,207,82,231,138,136,60,144,119,164]},"name":"Threat Level Red: Cybersecurity Research Programs of the U.S. Go","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
