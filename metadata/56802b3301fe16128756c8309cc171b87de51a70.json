Not much was known about the events leading up to the tragedy - only that one student, Carly Johnson, vanished without a trace....\r\n\r\n...until a diary is found hidden in the ruins.\r\n\r\nBut the diary, badly scorched, does not belong to Carly Johnson. It belongs to Kaitlyn Johnson, a girl who shouldn&apos;t exist. Who was Kaitlyn? Why did she come out only at night? What is her connection to Carly?\r\n\r\nThe case has been reopened. Police records are being reexamined: psychiatric reports, video footage, text messages, emails. And the diary.\r\n\r\nThe diary that paints a much more sinister version of events than was ever made publicly known.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-04-29T12:06:02.304Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:56802b3301fe16128756c8309cc171b87de51a70","dn":"The Dead House by Dawn Kurtagich EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"56802b3301fe16128756c8309cc171b87de51a70","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,128,43,51,1,254,22,18,135,86,200,48,156,193,113,184,125,229,26,112]},"name":"The Dead House by Dawn Kurtagich EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
