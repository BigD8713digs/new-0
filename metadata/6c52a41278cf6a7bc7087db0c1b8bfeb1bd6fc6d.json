When they disappear from a beach party one warm summer night, police launch a massive search. No clues are found, and hope is almost lost until Megan miraculously surfaces after escaping from a bunker deep in the woods. A year later the best-selling account of her ordeal has turned Megan from local hero to national celebrity. It&apos;s a triumphant, inspiring story except for one inconvenient detail: Nicole is still missing.\r\n\r\nNicole&apos;s older sister, Livia, a fellow in forensic pathology, expects that one day soon Nicole&apos;s body will be found, and it will be up to someone like Livia to analyze the evidence and finally determine her sister&apos;s fate. Instead the first clue to Nicole&apos;s disappearance comes from another body that shows up in Livia&apos;s morgue - that of a young man connected to Nicole&apos;s past. Livia reaches out to Megan for help, hoping to learn more about the night the two were taken. Other girls have gone missing, too, and Livia is increasingly certain the cases are connected. But Megan knows more than she revealed in her blockbuster book. Flashes of memory are coming together, pointing to something darker and more monstrous than her chilling memoir describes. And the deeper she and Livia dig, the more they realize that sometimes true terror lies in finding exactly what you&apos;ve been looking for.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-03-23T12:02:02.650Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c52a41278cf6a7bc7087db0c1b8bfeb1bd6fc6d","dn":"The Girl Who Was Taken by Charlie Donlea EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"6c52a41278cf6a7bc7087db0c1b8bfeb1bd6fc6d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,82,164,18,120,207,106,123,199,8,125,176,193,184,191,235,27,214,252,109]},"name":"The Girl Who Was Taken by Charlie Donlea EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
