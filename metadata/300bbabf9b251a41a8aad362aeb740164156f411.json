The film features a large ensemble cast of \r\nactors who would later become stars, including Jason London, Ben Affleck, \r\nMilla Jovovich, Cole Hauser, Parker Posey, Adam Goldberg, Joey Lauren Adams, \r\nMatthew McConaughey, Nicky Katt, and Rory Cochrane.\r\n\r\nIt&apos;s May 28, 1976, the last day of the academic year at Lee High School. Many \r\nof the kids are skipping classes, smoking weed and thinking about the big keg \r\nparty for the senior students at Kevin Pickford&apos;s house tonight, as his \r\nunwitting parents are going to be away for the evening. High on the mind of \r\nstar football quarterback Randall &quot;Pink&quot; Floyd is the pledge the coach wants \r\nall the returning players to sign vowing that they won&apos;t do drugs or drink \r\nduring the summer break so as not to jeopardise their upcoming supposed \r\nchampionship season. Pink is the only player who has not yet signed, he who is \r\ncontemplating not if only because he feels it would impinge upon his \r\nindividual rights. Today is also the traditional hazing day, where seniors \r\ntraumatise the freshmen. Amongst all the freshmen, Mitch Kramer is the biggest \r\ntarget if only because of a not so innocent request by his popular \r\nupperclassman sister, Jodi Kramer, to her male classmates. These thoughts and \r\nactivities continue as day turns into night and as the keg party doesn&apos;t end \r\nup quite as planned, although the perspective may change as the activities \r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nStars.\r\n=&gt;-Jason London : Pink.\r\n=&gt;-Joey Lauren Adams : Simone.\r\n=&gt;-Milla Jovovich : Michelle.\r\n=&gt;-Shawn Andrews : Pickford.\r\n=&gt;-Adam Goldberg : Mike.\r\n=&gt;-Matthew McConaughey : Wooderson.\r\n=&gt;-Ben Affleck : O&apos;Bannion.\r\n\r\nDirector.\r\n=&gt;-Richard Linklater.\r\n\r\nInfo.\r\n=&gt;-Release Date : 1993.\r\n=&gt;-Language : English.\r\n=&gt;-File Size : 1.34 GiB.\r\n=&gt;-Overall bit rate : 1 882 kbps.\r\n=&gt;-Movie Runtime : 1h 42min.\r\n=&gt;-Chapters : 19 Named.\r\n\r\nVideo.\r\n=&gt;-Codec : H.264/MPEG-4 AVC.\r\n=&gt;-Aspect Ratio : 1.85:1.\r\n=&gt;-Resolution : 1280 x 688.\r\n=&gt;-Bit rate : 1 444 kbps.\r\n\r\nAudio 1 English.\r\n=&gt;-Codec : mp4a: MPEG-4 AAC LC.\r\n=&gt;-Channels : 2 channel.\r\n=&gt;-Bit Rate : 128 kbps.\r\n=&gt;-Maximum bit rate : 137 kbps.\r\n\r\nAudio 2 English.\r\n=&gt;-Codec : Digital Audio Compression AC-3.\r\n=&gt;-Channels : 6 Front: L C R, Side: L R, LFE.\r\n=&gt;-Bit Rate : 320 kbps.\r\n=&gt;-Bit rate mode : Constant.\r\n\r\nSubtitles - Softsubbed : SubRip : MicroDVD.\r\n=&gt;-English","last_updated":"2017-12-31T12:04:31.976Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:300bbabf9b251a41a8aad362aeb740164156f411","dn":"Dazed And Confused - Comedy Ben Affleck 1993 Eng Subs 720p [H264","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"300bbabf9b251a41a8aad362aeb740164156f411","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,11,186,191,155,37,26,65,168,170,211,98,174,183,64,22,65,86,244,17]},"name":"Dazed And Confused - Comedy Ben Affleck 1993 Eng Subs 720p [H264","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
