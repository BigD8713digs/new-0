Sarah, a beautiful, successful lawyer, wants nothing more than to have a baby. But balancing IVF treatments with a grueling eighty-hour workweek is no walk in the park. Meanwhile, Annie, a Harvard-grad chemist recently transplanted to Southern California, is cutting coupons to afford her young autistic son&apos;s expensive therapy.\n\nDesperate, the two friends come up with a brilliant plan: they&apos;ll combine Sarah&apos;s looks and Annie&apos;s brains to sell a &quot;luxury&quot; antiaging face cream to the wealthy, fading beauties in Annie&apos;s La Jolla book club. The scheme seems innocent enough, until Annie decides to add a special - and oh-so-illegal - ingredient that could bring their whole operation crashing to the ground.\n\nHilarious, intelligent, and warm, Crimes Against a Book Club is a delightful look at the lengths women will go to fend for their families and for one another.\n\nxx","last_updated":"2018-01-30T12:10:25.298Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4a4d961204de843c6abad91f9c94609f2463150","dn":"Crimes Against a Book Club by Kathy Cooperman EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"c4a4d961204de843c6abad91f9c94609f2463150","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,164,217,97,32,77,232,67,198,171,173,145,249,201,70,9,242,70,49,80]},"name":"Crimes Against a Book Club by Kathy Cooperman EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
