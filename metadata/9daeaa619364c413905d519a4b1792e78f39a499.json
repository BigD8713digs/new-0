Mott, Edward M. Vavrek, Jyhwen Wang\r\nISBN-13: 9780134441184\r\nBOOK SPECS: https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/program/PGM333361.html\r\nFILE SPECS: true PDF, logical page numbers as in the print version, bookmarks, 31 MB\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: The concepts, procedures, data, and analysis techniques needed to design and integrate machine elements into mechanical devices and systems.\r\n\r\nFor over three decades students and practicing engineers have used &quot;Machine Elements in Mechanical Design&quot; to learn about the principles and practices of mechanical design. They have either continued to use the text in their careers, or have newly discovered it as an invaluable resource in their work. With an emphasis on applying the technology of various machine elements while considering those elements in the context of the larger machine, this text references a broad array of available resources, from industrial sources to professional organizations. It promotes practical decision making in design and provides excellent preparation for moving from an academic environment to a professional position with strong, long-term growth potential.\r\n\r\nBRIEF CONTENTS:\r\n---------------\r\nPART 1  Principles of Design and Stress Analysis\r\n 1 The Nature of Mechanical Design\r\n 2 Materials in Mechanical Design\r\n 3 Stress and Deformation Analysis\r\n 4 Combined Stresses and Stress Transformation\r\n 5 Design for Different Types of Loading\r\n 6 Columns\r\nPART 2  Design of a Mechanical Drive\r\n 7 Belt Drives, Chain Drives, and Wire Rope\r\n 8 Kinematics of Gears\r\n 9 Spur Gear Design\r\n 10 Helical Gears, Bevel Gears, and Wormgearing\r\n 11 Keys, Couplings, and Seals\r\n 12 Shaft Design\r\n 13 Tolerances and Fits\r\n 14 Rolling Contact Bearings\r\n 15 Completion of the Design of a Power Transmission\r\nPART 3  Design Details and Other Machine Elements\r\n 16 Plain Surface Bearings\r\n 17 Linear Motion Elements\r\n 18 Springs\r\n 19 Fasteners\r\n 20 Machine Frames, Bolted Connections, and Welded Joints\r\n 21 Electric Motors and Controls\r\n 22 Motion Control: Clutches and Brakes\r\n 23 Design Projects\r\nappendixes\r\nanswers\r\nindex","last_updated":"2018-09-09T12:22:12.423Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:9daeaa619364c413905d519a4b1792e78f39a499","dn":"Machine Elements in Mechanical Design 6th ed 2018 by Robert Mott","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"9daeaa619364c413905d519a4b1792e78f39a499","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,174,170,97,147,100,196,19,144,93,81,154,75,23,146,231,143,57,164,153]},"name":"Machine Elements in Mechanical Design 6th ed 2018 by Robert Mott","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
