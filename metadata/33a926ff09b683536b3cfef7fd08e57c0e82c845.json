In this major new history, the renowned historian Raymond Kevorkian provides an authoritative account of the origins, events and consequences of the years 1915 and 1916. He considers the role that the Armenian Genocide played in the construction of the Turkish nation state and Turkish identity, as well as exploring the ideologies of power, rule and state violence. Crucially, he examines the consequences of the violence against the Armenians, the implications of deportations and attempts to bring those who committed the atrocities to justice.\r\nKevorkian offers a detailed and meticulous record, providing an authoritative analysis of the events and their impact upon the Armenian community itself, as well as the development of the Turkish state. This important book will serve as an indispensable resource to historians of the period, as well as those wishing to understand the history of genocidal violence more generally","last_updated":"2017-04-25T12:31:58.636Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:33a926ff09b683536b3cfef7fd08e57c0e82c845","dn":"Raymond Kevorkian - The Armenian Genocide - A Complete History -","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"33a926ff09b683536b3cfef7fd08e57c0e82c845","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,169,38,255,9,182,131,83,107,60,254,247,253,8,229,124,14,130,200,69]},"name":"Raymond Kevorkian - The Armenian Genocide - A Complete History -","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
