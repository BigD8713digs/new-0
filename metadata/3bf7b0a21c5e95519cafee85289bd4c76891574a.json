I&apos;m not including my serial and email and such. I&apos;ve noticed that the one file used for aerosoft seems to work for them all, so I&apos;m including that.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\nStart installation.\r\nWhen at registration screen press the windows key(flag at bottom)+r\r\nType in %TEMP%\r\nSort by date\r\nGo into the most recent one should be a bunch of letters and number.\r\nGo into the folder with a bunch of letters and numbers.\r\nCopy ascrypt_pro.dll there and overwrite.\r\nGo back to installation and click next.\r\nInstall as normal.\r\n\r\n\r\nI believe this is the most recent version. Haven&apos;t checked in a while. I got it when it was on sale. Since v1.11 isn&apos;t on here I though I&apos;d upload it. Untested. I don&apos;t feel like reinstalling since I used my legal stuff. Should work. If not maybe someone can make a crack for it. \r\n\r\nI also have the most recent verson of Cielosim Jacksonville if anyone wants it. It has animated jetways. With default FSX system.\r\n\r\nI don&apos;t take requests. Feel free to ask one but don&apos;t expect me to do it. I search for things when I need them. Should I find something that doesn&apos;t exist here I&apos;ll upload it.\r\n\r\nI don&apos;t know if this airport has been updated for P3D v4. This one doesn&apos;t support it for sure. I&apos;m not in the mood to check.\r\n\r\nIf it doesn&apos;t work the only two things I can think of is that you didn&apos;t install it right or the crack doesn&apos;t work for this. It works fine in game. SODE jetways work great. The installation doesn&apos;t have that error and subsequent problem that the other version on here has","last_updated":"2017-06-25T12:03:42.110Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:3bf7b0a21c5e95519cafee85289bd4c76891574a","dn":"FSX,FSXSE,P3DAerosoft Malpensa LIMC v1.11","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"3bf7b0a21c5e95519cafee85289bd4c76891574a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,247,176,162,28,94,149,81,156,175,238,133,40,155,212,199,104,145,87,74]},"name":"FSX,FSXSE,P3DAerosoft Malpensa LIMC v1.11","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
