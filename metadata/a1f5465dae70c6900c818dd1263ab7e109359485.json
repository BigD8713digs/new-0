The tracks live a life of their own, not proceeding from one to the next following a creative path. On the contrary, Pitfall is the most beautifully inconsistent work the band has ever written. Gone are the days of the dark, rain- drenched compositions that made their previous works stand out; this album is a hymn to eclecticism and the array of influences which have surely contributed to the ensemble&apos;s fortune. This is heavy stuff: one which might depict the disillusion of man with the city, the rage flowing like a lifeline in our streets or, more simply, a sign that the times are changing and post- industrial life demands pretty sharp answers... - Alex Franquelli, All About Jazz","last_updated":"2017-07-09T12:01:48.757Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1f5465dae70c6900c818dd1263ab7e109359485","dn":"The Remote Viewers 2015 Pitfall","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"a1f5465dae70c6900c818dd1263ab7e109359485","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,245,70,93,174,112,198,144,12,129,141,209,38,58,183,225,9,53,148,133]},"name":"The Remote Viewers 2015 Pitfall","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
