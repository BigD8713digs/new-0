It begins in New York, where Barack Obama learns that his father, a figure he knows more as a myth than as a man, has been killed in a car accident. This sudden death inspires an emotional odyssey; first to a small town in Kansas, from which he retraces the migration of his mother&apos;s family to Hawaii, and then to Kenya, where he meets the African side of his family, confronts the bitter truth of his father&apos;s life, and at last reconciles his divided inheritance.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-08-07T12:02:13.365Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:eae3eec625a23f2fec6d61ee770de86a0bc501ff","dn":"Dreams from My Father by Barack Obama ePUB MOBI eBOOK-ZAK","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"eae3eec625a23f2fec6d61ee770de86a0bc501ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,227,238,198,37,162,63,47,236,109,97,238,119,13,232,106,11,197,1,255]},"name":"Dreams from My Father by Barack Obama ePUB MOBI eBOOK-ZAK","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
