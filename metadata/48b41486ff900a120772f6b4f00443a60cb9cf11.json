In this course, Lisa Bock reviews the fundamental concepts underlying Wireshark, such as network analysis and the OSI model, and examines some example packet captures so you can start to understand field values and compare normal to abnormal network behaviors. You&apos;ll also be introduced to common attack signatures, display and capture filters, and protocols such as HTTP, TCP, DNS, and FTP.\r\nTopics include:\r\nExploring the Wireshark interface\r\nUsing display and capture filters\r\nDissecting the OSI model\r\nAnalyzing TCP, IPv4, and other protocols\r\nDetecting denial-of-service attacks and password attacks\r\nUsing security tools for ethical hacking","last_updated":"2017-07-16T12:04:01.659Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:48b41486ff900a120772f6b4f00443a60cb9cf11","dn":"Lynda - Troubleshooting Your Network with Wireshark","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"48b41486ff900a120772f6b4f00443a60cb9cf11","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,180,20,134,255,144,10,18,7,114,246,180,240,4,67,166,12,185,207,17]},"name":"Lynda - Troubleshooting Your Network with Wireshark","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
