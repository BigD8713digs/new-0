Olson EPUB\r\n\r\nCalvinist theology has been debated and promoted for centuries. But is it a theology that should last? Roger Olson suggests that Calvinism, also commonly known as Reformed theology, holds an unwarranted place in our list of accepted theologies. In Against Calvinism, readers will find scholarly arguments explaining why Calvinist theology is incorrect and how it affects God&apos;s reputation.\r\n\r\nOlson draws on a variety of sources, including Scripture, reason, tradition, and experience, to support his critique of Calvinism and the more historically rich, biblically faithful alternative theologies he proposes.Addressing what many evangelical Christians are concerned about today - so-called &apos;new Calvinism,&apos; a movement embraced by a generation labeled as &apos;young, restless, Reformed&apos; - Against Calvinism is the only book of its kind to offer objections from a non-Calvinist perspective to the current wave of Calvinism among Christian youth. As a companion to Michael Horton&apos;s For Calvinism, readers will be able to compare contrasting perspectives and form their own opinions on the merits and weaknesses of Calvinism.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-10-25T12:02:56.494Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:39f9808362713bbde3f43a0cf98e4e03df02ae37","dn":"Against Calvinism by Roger E.
