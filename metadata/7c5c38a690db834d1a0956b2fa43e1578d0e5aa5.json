Both are wonderful records, but before either was recorded the two guitarists camped in a house in Leeds for a couple of days to put to tape a fairly brief but always intriguing set of ten tracks, all recorded live without overdubs. \r\nThe pairing works especially well when the two guitars move back slightly from the microphone and sneak around a bit; &#x2018;Night, Moon, Dance&#x2019; counter-balances the more up-tempo &#x2018;Earls of Errol&#x2019;, with a similar but quieter finger-picked selling point leading on nicely and forming a strong couplet to begin the record. Here the boys&#x2019; playing stays hand in hand for the most part, with a dart from the trail every so often, to create the undulating landscape rhythm that they do so well on their solo albums. Perhaps best of all though is &#x2018;The Marcher Lords&#x2019;, a beautiful tune that forms the centrepiece to the album. It starts leisurely, with both guitars running parallel before Toby strays further down the fretboard and Jim creates a gorgeous slightly slower melody. They sit in perfect harmony here, either staying together in the tune or drifting apart to rejoin down the way and the result is a beautifully well thought out track. You can almost see the high five when this one was played back after the recording session. \r\n\r\nTracklist: \r\n01 - The Earls of Errol.flac \r\n02 - Night, Moon, Dance.flac \r\n03 - Interlude I.flac \r\n04 - Goat Fell.flac \r\n05 - The Marcher Lords.flac \r\n06 - The Huntsman and the Horse.flac \r\n07 - Wesleyan.flac \r\n08 - Interlude II.flac \r\n09 - Hawksworth Grove.flac \r\n10 - Arran to Aboyne.flac \r\n\r\nSummary: \r\nCountry: UK \r\nGenre: alternative folk","last_updated":"2018-12-07T12:08:21.265Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c5c38a690db834d1a0956b2fa43e1578d0e5aa5","dn":"[alternative folk] (2018) Jim Ghedi and Toby Hay - The Hawkswort","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"7c5c38a690db834d1a0956b2fa43e1578d0e5aa5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,92,56,166,144,219,131,77,26,9,86,178,250,67,225,87,141,14,90,165]},"name":"[alternative folk] (2018) Jim Ghedi and Toby Hay - The Hawkswort","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
