In recovery and working as a freelance safecracker for the DEA, the FBI, and any other government agency willing to pay him, Ghost is determined to live clean for the rest of his days. And maybe he could, if the most important person in his life hadn&apos;t gotten into serious financial trouble. To fix it, all Ghost has to do is crack a safe and steal drug money from under the noses of the gangs and the feds without getting caught. Or killed.\r\n\r\nRudy &apos;Glasses&apos; Reyes runs drugs and cleans up messes for the baddest of bad men. When Ghost hits one of his safes, Glasses must hunt him down or be held accountable. But Glasses is worried about more than just money. The heist puts everything in his life at risk - his livelihood, his freedom, even his family.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-10-30T12:05:29.870Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:06ccc84f2f01d998bba16fbe35a8db70c8ee0bf2","dn":"Safe by Ryan Gattis EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"06ccc84f2f01d998bba16fbe35a8db70c8ee0bf2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,204,200,79,47,1,217,152,187,161,111,190,53,168,219,112,200,238,11,242]},"name":"Safe by Ryan Gattis EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
