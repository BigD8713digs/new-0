A toolkit for shock-resistance.&quot; (Naomi Klein, from the preface)\r\n\r\nThe election of Donald Trump is a dangerous escalation in a world of cascading crises. Trump&apos;s vision - a radical deregulation of the US economy in the interest of corporations, an all-out war on &quot;radical Islamic terrorism&quot;, and sweeping aside climate science to unleash a domestic fossil fuel frenzy - will generate wave after wave of crises and shocks to the economy, to national security, to the environment.\r\n\r\nIn No Is Not Enough, Naomi Klein explains that Trump, extreme as he is, is not an aberration but a logical extension of the worst and most dangerous trends of the past half century. In exposing the malignant forces behind Trump&apos;s rise, she puts forward a bold vision for a mass movement to counter rising militarism, racism, and corporatism in the United States and around the world.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-08-17T12:02:59.976Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4bb9e6d6d86bcff12b3df001eba017b6a2a32bc","dn":"No Is Not Enough_ Resisting Trump's Shock Politics and Winning t","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"a4bb9e6d6d86bcff12b3df001eba017b6a2a32bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,187,158,109,109,134,188,255,18,179,223,0,30,186,1,123,106,42,50,188]},"name":"No Is Not Enough_ Resisting Trump's Shock Politics and Winning t","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
