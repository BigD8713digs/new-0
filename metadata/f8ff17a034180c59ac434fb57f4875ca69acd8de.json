Seth is awkward and shy. Carter is the glamorous heir to one of America&apos;s great fortunes. They have one thing in common: an obsession with music. Seth is desperate to reach for the future. Carter is slipping back into the past. When Seth accidentally records an unknown singer in a park, Carter sends it out over the Internet, claiming it&apos;s a long lost 1920s blues recording by a musician called Charlie Shaw. When an old collector contacts them to say that their fake record and their fake bluesman are actually real, the two young white men, accompanied by Carter&apos;s troubled sister Leonie, spiral down into the heart of the nation&apos;s darkness, encountering a suppressed history of greed, envy, revenge, and exploitation. White Tears is a ghost story, a terrifying murder mystery, a timely meditation on race, and a love letter to all the forgotten geniuses of American music.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-09-26T12:00:55.143Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:f8ff17a034180c59ac434fb57f4875ca69acd8de","dn":"White Tears_ A Novel by Hari Kunzru ePUB eBOOK-ZAK","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"f8ff17a034180c59ac434fb57f4875ca69acd8de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,255,23,160,52,24,12,89,172,67,79,181,127,72,117,202,105,172,216,222]},"name":"White Tears_ A Novel by Hari Kunzru ePUB eBOOK-ZAK","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
