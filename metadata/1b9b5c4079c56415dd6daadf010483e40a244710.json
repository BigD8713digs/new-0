The teacher Maia was once Ethel, a young Victorian lady of much learning and few prospects, who prayed to Pallas Athene in an unguarded moment during a trip to Rome--and, in an instant, found herself in the Just City with grey-eyed Athene standing unmistakably before her.\r\n\r\nJo Walton - [Thessaly 02] - The Philosopher Kings (epub)\r\nJo Walton - [Thessaly 03] - Necessity\r\n\r\nPatrick E McLean - How to Succeed in Evil Series\r\n\r\nHow to Succeed in Evil is the story of Edwin Windsor, Evil Efficiency Consultant. He tries to help super-villains be more villainous--or at least more profitable and sensible about the business side of Evil. Along with his very proper and English secretary Agnes and his hench-lawyer Topper, he struggles to make the world of super-powered people make sense, but this is very difficult because while Edwin&#x2019;s advice is excellent, all of his clients are too egomaniacal to listen. There is, it must be said, a bit of comedy in this work. Edwin struggles with a cast of characters, including Dr. Loeb, a trust fund child who desperately wants to be an Evil Genius but has none of the talent. \r\nPatrick E McLean - [How to Succeed in Evil 00] - Consultation with a Vampire (epub)\r\nPatrick E McLean - [How to Succeed in Evil 01] - How to Succeed in Evil (epub)\r\nPatrick E McLean - [How to Succeed in Evil 02] - Hostile Takeover (epub)","last_updated":"2018-05-28T12:13:14.105Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b9b5c4079c56415dd6daadf010483e40a244710","dn":"Jo Walton-Patrick E McLean Series [Fantasy] EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"1b9b5c4079c56415dd6daadf010483e40a244710","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,155,92,64,121,197,100,21,221,109,170,223,1,4,131,228,10,36,71,16]},"name":"Jo Walton-Patrick E McLean Series [Fantasy] EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
