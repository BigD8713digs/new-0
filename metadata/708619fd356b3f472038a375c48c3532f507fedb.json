While there is a great deal of options, the program seems to be aimed at users with a lot of prior image altering knowledge. \r\n\r\nThe program&apos;s interface kept us guessing when we started since it was cluttered with icons for editing tools and various windows with technical information. A visit to the Help file&apos;s definitions clarified a lot, but we still needed to experiment, especially to understand the more technical aspects. The program offered a great deal of editing options, from ones that fix small facial blemishes to cropping the photo to overall distortions of the image. The tools all worked well, but required a steady hand and an understanding of each tool&apos;s aesthetic properties to fully utilize them, which frequently resulted in pictures looking worse than when we started. The boxes to the right detailed highly specific elements, such as the RGB composition of the color and weren&apos;t helpful in our situation. One thing that wasn&apos;t over our head was the features that adjusted the picture&apos;s quality, like the slider option that roughed up the image and made it look old. Overall, though, we never felt comfortable with this program because of its demands of specific knowledge.PhotoLine comes as a 30-day trial. While all its elements worked, we&apos;ve tested other photo editors that were more welcoming to novice users and we do not recommend this program. \r\n\r\nHow to Install: \r\n1). Instructions are included in ReadMe.txt if needed. \r\n2). Thats all, Done &amp; enjoy","last_updated":"2018-07-14T12:03:31.863Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:708619fd356b3f472038a375c48c3532f507fedb","dn":"PhotoLine v21.00 incl Patch - Crackingpatching","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"708619fd356b3f472038a375c48c3532f507fedb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,134,25,253,53,107,63,71,32,56,163,117,196,140,53,50,245,7,254,219]},"name":"PhotoLine v21.00 incl Patch - Crackingpatching","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
