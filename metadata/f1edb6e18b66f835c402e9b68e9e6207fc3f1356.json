Suddenly, Sherman finds himself embroiled in the most brutal, high-profile case of the year, as prosecutors, politicians, the press, the police, the clergy, and assorted hustlers rush in to further their own political and social agendas. With so many egos at stake, the last priority on anyone&apos;s mind is truth or justice in this bitingly hilarious American satire.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-08-29T12:04:37.228Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:f1edb6e18b66f835c402e9b68e9e6207fc3f1356","dn":"The Bonfire of the Vanities_ A Novel by Tom Wolfe ePUB MOBI eBOO","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"f1edb6e18b66f835c402e9b68e9e6207fc3f1356","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,237,182,225,139,102,248,53,196,2,233,182,142,158,98,7,252,63,19,86]},"name":"The Bonfire of the Vanities_ A Novel by Tom Wolfe ePUB MOBI eBOO","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
