To most people, he&apos;s Spock. To others, he&apos;s also the man who brought us the love-it-or-hate it &quot;The Ballad of Bilbo Baggins&quot; and the inadvertently funny covers of pop songs found on Rhino Records&apos; Golden Throats. What many people don&apos;t know is that Leonard Nimoy was an overnight smash when his records hit the late 60s-early 70s music scene.\r\n\r\nThe public tends to think of Nimoy in his Spock persona&#x2026; calm, collected, and logical. But Nimoy as a man was groovy, hip, keenly interested in social causes, and a man with a good sense of humor who didn&apos;t let fame go to his head. These sensibilities are on display in the series of records he made for Paramount Pictures&apos; subsidiary, Dot Records, from 1967 to 1970.\r\n\r\nTracklist\r\n(01) [Leonard Nimoy] Theme From Star Trek.mp3\r\n(02) [Leonard Nimoy] Alien.mp3\r\n(03) [Leonard Nimoy] Where Is Love.mp3\r\n(04) [Leonard Nimoy] Music To Watch Space Girls By.mp3\r\n(05) [Leonard Nimoy] Beyond Antares.mp3\r\n(06) [Leonard Nimoy] Twinkle, Twinkle Little Earth.mp3\r\n(07) [Leonard Nimoy] Mission Impossible.mp3\r\n(08) [Leonard Nimoy] Lost In The Stars.mp3\r\n(09) [Leonard Nimoy] Where No Man Has Gone Before.mp3\r\n(10) [Leonard Nimoy] You Are Not Alone.mp3\r\n(11) [Leonard Nimoy] A Visit To A Sad Planet.mp3\r\n(12) [Leonard Nimoy] Highly Illogical.mp3\r\n(13) [Leonard Nimoy] The Difference Between Us.mp3\r\n(14) [Leonard Nimoy] Once I Smiled.mp3\r\n(15) [Leonard Nimoy] Spock Thoughts.mp3\r\n(16) [Leonard Nimoy] By Myself.mp3\r\n(17) [Leonard Nimoy] Follow Your Star.mp3\r\n(18) [Leonard Nimoy] Amphibious Assault.mp3\r\n\r\nI dont usually post this kind of content but I gotta throw a curve every now and then","last_updated":"2017-05-27T08:52:39.163Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:64eba508a1e365722a3a7567c5621d6563711e0f","dn":"Leonard Nimoy present - Mr. Spock's Music From Ou (1967","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"64eba508a1e365722a3a7567c5621d6563711e0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,235,165,8,161,227,101,114,42,58,117,103,197,98,29,101,99,113,30,15]},"name":"Leonard Nimoy present - Mr. Spock's Music From Ou (1967","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
