I cannot for the life of me find a copy of his first short movie - if anyone can find his debut 1962 short film Gomudeppou (aka Rubber Band Pistol), please let me know.\r\n\r\n\tStill looking for: Gomudeppou (1962) https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2075192\r\n\r\nThe films are ripped in various different codecs, but are all embedded in matroska (.mkv) containers. Use VLC to watch them. They all have working english subtitles(*), softcoded. If you have any problems watching it, Google is your friend, not me. As your IT helpdesk will fondly tell you, the files are all working here, so the problem is at your end.\r\n\r\nI only have a 720p rip of Tampopo, but would love to see all of them in higher resolution. Again, your help is appreciated.\r\n\r\n(*) Supa No Onna has hardcoded Chinese(?) subs, but working English subs softcoded as well. I couldn&apos;t find a clean copy.\r\n\r\n  - Abner Doom, hoarder/collector\r\n\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: I did not rip these myself, but have found them elsewhere online, over a long period of time. I&apos;ve merged the original movie files and their English subtitles into single .mkv files, changed the filenames, and in the process have lost the names of the original rippers, so my apologies, but also thank you to those who shared them in the first place. Share and enjoy.\r\n\r\n\r\n-  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -\r\nThe movies\r\n-  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -\r\nJuzo Itami (1984) - Ososhiki (aka The Funeral)\r\nJuzo Itami (1985) - Tampopo (aka Dandelion) [720p]\r\nJuzo Itami (1987) - Marusa No Onna (aka A Taxing Woman)\r\nJuzo Itami (1988) - Marusa No Onna II (aka A Taxing Woman&apos;s Return)\r\nJuzo Itami (1990) - A-ge-man (aka Tales Of A Golden Geisha)\r\nJuzo Itami (1992) - Minbo No Onna (aka The Anti-Extortion Woman)\r\nJuzo Itami (1993) - Daibyonin (aka The Last Dance)\r\nJuzo Itami (1995) - Shizukana Seikatsu (aka A Quiet Life)\r\nJuzo Itami (1996) - Supa No Onna (aka Supermarket Woman)\r\nJuzo Itami (1997) - Marutai No Onna (aka Woman in Witness Protection)","last_updated":"2018-10-06T12:42:52.558Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b4c72f0ccedbe5e90abf3d2805a9fd6182e2f51","dn":"Juzo Itami Filmography","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"9b4c72f0ccedbe5e90abf3d2805a9fd6182e2f51","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,76,114,240,204,237,190,94,144,171,243,210,128,90,159,214,24,46,47,81]},"name":"Juzo Itami Filmography","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
