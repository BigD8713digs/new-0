The minimum system requirements remain, as expected, the same, although this customized version of Windows should run faster than the original one, due to the number of changes made  which are listed below\r\n\r\nThis is the first version, supporting only 64 bit CPUs at the moment (there will be a 32bit version later).\r\n\r\nYoutube Preview:\nWindows to USB Tutorial:\n\r\nSystem Requirements\r\n&#x2022;Processor:1 gigahertz (GHz) or faster, 64 bit processor with NX/PAE\r\nSSE2 (if Windows 8 worked, this will work as well)\r\n&#x2022;RAM:2 GB for 64-bit (1 GB might still handle it just fine)\r\n&#x2022;Hard disk space:20 GB\r\n&#x2022;Graphics card: DirectX 9 or later\r\n\r\nChanges and informations(most important ones, anyway):\r\n-Removed most Metro apps excluding Edge, Store and Calculator\r\n-Removed most non-essential drivers (such as graphics, printers, network)\r\nThese will have to be manually downloaded &amp; installed depending on each computer specs\r\n-Removed some accessibility items\r\n-Removed Speech and support for Cortana\r\n-Removed Search (the search bar in Explorer still works)\r\n-Removed Windows Media Player\r\n-Enabled Windows Photo Viewer to be used instead of the metro app &quot;Photos&quot;, although pictures will first open up in Paint, until the user changes the default app to Windows Photo Viewer.\r\n-Disabled Hibernate\r\n-Disabled Page File\r\n-Removed Firewall (though in some cases it may show up while using a program, and the service has not been removed since it&apos;s essential)\r\n-Windows Update has not been removed yet there&apos;s no guarantee it works since I always disable it through services.msc (it is still necessary to have it enabled in order to install apps from the Store,)\r\n-Apps from Store should work in order though...\r\n-Games from Store no longer work (couldn&apos;t figure out why). Non-UWP Games (CS:GO for example) should still work, considering you will have your drivers updated","last_updated":"2017-07-04T12:02:01.432Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca28ef76f45688b3412050e3e325e14eb8d9dde1","dn":"Windows 10 Pro Lite Build 1511-10586","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"ca28ef76f45688b3412050e3e325e14eb8d9dde1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,40,239,118,244,86,136,179,65,32,80,227,227,37,225,78,184,217,221,225]},"name":"Windows 10 Pro Lite Build 1511-10586","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
