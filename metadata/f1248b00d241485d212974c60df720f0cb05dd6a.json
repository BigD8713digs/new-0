Qigong is the traditional Chinese practice of low-impact body movement based on the ancient theory that the beneficial flow of energy&#x2014;or &#x201C;qi&#x201D;&#x2014;through the body restores vitality and regulates the functions of the mind, body, and breath. Drawing on centuries-old knowledge, the practice protects against disease and other complications that arise when the meridians through which energy flows are blocked. \r\n\r\nQigong has had spectacular results in patients, eliminating the need for medication and surgery that Western doctors often recommend for concerns that are simply part of the natural stages of a woman&#x2019;s life. \r\n\r\nThis guide contains qigong exercises with photo instructions, as well as mindful breathing techniques, acupressure, herbal remedies, a seasonal fasting plan, and 50 delicious healing recipes, including Ma Po Tofu and Lotus Root and Asian Pear Stir-Fry. Master Hou teaches women at any stage in their lives how to manage their internal energy, awaken their own powers of self-healing, and gain insight into the deep connections within their bodies. Women seeking in natural solutions to sleeping soundly, strengthening the immune system, thriving during childbearing years, taking menopause in stride, and achieving overall wellness in their lives will find answers here.\r\n\r\nGenre: Non-Fiction &gt; Health, Fitness &amp; Medical","last_updated":"2018-09-26T12:26:30.992Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:f1248b00d241485d212974c60df720f0cb05dd6a","dn":"The Body in Balance by Master Faxiang Hou (.epub)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"f1248b00d241485d212974c60df720f0cb05dd6a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,36,139,0,210,65,72,93,33,41,116,198,13,247,32,240,203,5,221,106]},"name":"The Body in Balance by Master Faxiang Hou (.epub)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
