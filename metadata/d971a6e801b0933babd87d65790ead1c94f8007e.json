Florence is everything Lilian is not&#x2014;brave, confident, quick to find adventure and American. The women have been out of touch for years due to a family rift, but Lilian, childless, single and self-employed as a pet portraitist, has been watching Florence for years. Florence is now Internet-famous as Eleven Novak, the face of a compelling new feminine lifestyle empowerment brand.\r\n\r\nWhen Eleven comes to town as part of her sales tour, she offers Lilian a place at the Temple, her Manhattan office. Despite twenty years of silence, Eleven welcomes her long-lost cousin with open arms, and the two women begin a new relationship. Lilian quickly enrols in the Ascendency, Eleven&#x2019;s signature program: an expensive three-month training seminar on empowered leadership, spiritual awakening, and sales and marketing. Eleven is going to help her cousin rise up to be her highest self: confident, affluent and self-actualized.\r\n\r\nLilian&#x2019;s sensitive, artistic nature is stretched by the work she does in the Ascendency, and pushed even further by her cousin&#x2019;s careful life coaching. In just three months, Lilian&#x2019;s life changes drastically and becomes everything she&#x2019;s dreamed of. But is it everything she wants? And can she trust everything Eleven says? \r\n\r\n\r\n  <a href=\"\nhttps://pirates-forum.org/Forum-Requests\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://pirates-forum.org/Forum-Requests</a>","last_updated":"2018-09-30T12:38:44.822Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:d971a6e801b0933babd87d65790ead1c94f8007e","dn":"Sarah Selecky - Radiant Shimmering Light (epub)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"d971a6e801b0933babd87d65790ead1c94f8007e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,113,166,232,1,176,147,59,171,216,125,101,121,14,173,28,148,248,0,126]},"name":"Sarah Selecky - Radiant Shimmering Light (epub)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
