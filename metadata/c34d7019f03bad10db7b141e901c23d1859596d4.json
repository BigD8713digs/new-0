In early 21st-century Thailand, Scott is an expatriate slacker. Then, one day, he inadvertently witnesses an impossible event: the violent appearance of a 200-foot stone pillar in the forested interior. Its arrival collapses trees for a quarter mile around its base, freezing ice out of the air and emitting a burst of ionizing radiation. It appears to be composed of an exotic form of matter. And the inscription chiseled into it commemorates a military victory - 16 years in the future.\r\n\r\nShortly afterwards, another, larger pillar arrives in the center of Bangkok - obliterating the city and killing thousands. Over the next several years, human society is transformed by these mysterious arrivals from, seemingly, our own near future. Who is the warlord &quot;Kuin&quot; whose victories they note?\r\n\r\nScott wants only to rebuild his life. But some strange loop of causality keeps drawing him in, to the central mystery and a final battle with the future.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-12-11T12:06:39.837Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:c34d7019f03bad10db7b141e901c23d1859596d4","dn":"The Chronoliths by Robert Charles Wilson EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"c34d7019f03bad10db7b141e901c23d1859596d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,77,112,25,240,59,173,16,219,123,20,30,144,28,35,209,133,149,150,212]},"name":"The Chronoliths by Robert Charles Wilson EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
