Now, Zell&apos;s best friends are left to wonder whether their own passions are worth risking their predetermined &quot;happily ever afters&quot;, regardless of the consequences. CeCi wonders whether she should become a professional chef, sharp-tongued and quick-witted Bianca wants to escape an engagement to her platonic friend, and Rory will do anything to make her boorish husband love her. But as Bianca&apos;s wedding approaches, can they escape their fates - and is there enough wine in all of the Realm to help them?\r\n\r\nIn this hilarious modern interpretation of the fairy-tale stories we all know and love, Letters to Zell explores what happens when women abandon the stories they didn&apos;t write for themselves and go completely off script to follow their dreams.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2017-11-25T13:18:10.969Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:ddf4bf2fcbf003bb89c3d7747d6498a1e626a53e","dn":"Letters to Zell by Camille Griep EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"ddf4bf2fcbf003bb89c3d7747d6498a1e626a53e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,244,191,47,203,240,3,187,137,195,215,116,125,100,152,161,230,38,165,62]},"name":"Letters to Zell by Camille Griep EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
