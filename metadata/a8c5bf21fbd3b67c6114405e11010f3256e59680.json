Per our course content, including hands-on coding exercises, there were a few breaking changes in the 5.1 releases which ripped across much of the original project code and also included minor, non-breaking changes which outdated certain aspects of our original content.\r\n\r\nWho is the target audience?\r\n\r\n    This course is built for web developers who design and build UI/UX solutions for mobile and the web.\r\n    This course is designed for those developers who want to design with Angular as easily as they can with other JavaScript frameworks.\r\n    Of course, the info presented here is just as valuable for architects, testers, and product managers as they too should understand how Angular is designed and used in a complete web solution.\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n\r\n    Before taking this course, a student should ideally (but not absolutely) have some experience in: Creating web UI&#x2019;s with normal Javascript tools (i.e. jQuery, Bootstrap, ASP.NET, AngularJS, etc.) Programming with a common object-oriented or scripting language (i.e. Java, C#, Python, PHP, etc.) JavaScript development of complete client-side solutions.\r\n    NO ANGULAR EXPERIENCE IS REQUIRED!!!","last_updated":"2018-04-25T12:09:08.522Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8c5bf21fbd3b67c6114405e11010f3256e59680","dn":"Udemy - Starting with Angular 4 (updated for Version 5)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"a8c5bf21fbd3b67c6114405e11010f3256e59680","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,197,191,33,251,211,182,124,97,20,64,94,17,1,15,50,86,229,150,128]},"name":"Udemy - Starting with Angular 4 (updated for Version 5)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
