The sound of the group reflects the varied influences of Jazz, Funk, Rock and experimental music that have imbued Adam&#x2019;s musical sphere since first picking up the guitar. Being a product of the 1960s and 70s musical landscape, Adam&#x2019;s initial musical inspirations were The Beatles and the sounds of R+B that were pervasive at the time &#x2013; The Temptations, The Four Tops, Curtis Mayfield, Isaac Hayes &#x2013; to later subsuming the immense influence of Jimi Hendrix, the blues masters and the music of Charlie Parker and John Coltrane. He has crafted a body of work for the group that, through his kaleidoscopic lens, sonically and musically refracts his musical history into a cohesive, groove laden musical concept. - cdbaby.com","last_updated":"2017-07-09T12:02:07.461Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:76410b5cbb0308799459d4df3c65ef74048b463d","dn":"Adam Rogers 2017 Dice","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"76410b5cbb0308799459d4df3c65ef74048b463d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,65,11,92,187,3,8,121,148,89,212,223,60,101,239,116,4,139,70,61]},"name":"Adam Rogers 2017 Dice","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
