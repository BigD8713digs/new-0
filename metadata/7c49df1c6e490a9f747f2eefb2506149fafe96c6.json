Obsessed with Stephen Douglas, his political rival, he battled him for decades. Successful as a circuit lawyer, Lincoln built his team of loyalists. Blumenthal reveals how Douglas and Jefferson Davis acting together made possible Lincoln&#x2019;s rise.\r\n\r\nBlumenthal describes a socially awkward suitor who had a nervous breakdown over his inability to deal with the opposite sex. His marriage to the upper class Mary Todd was crucial to his social aspirations and his political career. \r\n\r\nBlumenthal portrays Mary as an asset to her husband, a rare woman of her day with strong political opinions.\r\n\r\nBlumenthal&#x2019;s robust portrayal is based on prodigious research of Lincoln&#x2019;s record and of the period and its main players. It reflects both Lincoln&#x2019;s time and the struggle that consumes our own political debate","last_updated":"2017-06-26T12:00:26.584Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c49df1c6e490a9f747f2eefb2506149fafe96c6","dn":"A Self-Made Man: The Political Life of Abraham Lincoln Vol. I, 1","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"7c49df1c6e490a9f747f2eefb2506149fafe96c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,73,223,28,110,73,10,159,116,127,46,239,178,80,97,73,250,254,150,198]},"name":"A Self-Made Man: The Political Life of Abraham Lincoln Vol. I, 1","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
