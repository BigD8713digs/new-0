I was defending the show, saying it&apos;s still good for a watch. The production values! \r\n\r\nBy the 7th episode, I was alone. No one else was with me. \r\n\r\nSo this is the result, this edit is for ones who would like the show to be a bit more like the old show. \r\n\r\nNo swear words, less violence, less focus on the main character. That type of thing. \r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy!","last_updated":"2018-09-30T12:35:29.942Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:f219eb2632d60f1941c4e87c077a163ab6fe8300","dn":"Star Trek Discovery s01 fanedits","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"f219eb2632d60f1941c4e87c077a163ab6fe8300","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,25,235,38,50,214,15,25,65,196,232,124,7,122,22,58,182,254,131,0]},"name":"Star Trek Discovery s01 fanedits","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
