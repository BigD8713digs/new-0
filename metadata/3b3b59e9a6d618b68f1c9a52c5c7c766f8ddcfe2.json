Some are memorialized in legend, like the Irish pirate Grace O&apos;Malley, while others are included because of their influential relationships: Emma Hamilton had a scandalous affair with Admiral Nelson; Lady Jane Franklin launched an intensive campaign for the rescue of her husband&apos;s lost 1845 Polar expedition that not only secured Sir John Franklin&apos;s reputation as an arctic explorer but led to the opening and mapping of new arctic routes.\r\n\r\nShe Captains brings together a real-life cast of characters whose audacity and bravado will capture the imagination. In her inimitable style, Joan Druett paints a vivid portrait of real women who were drawn to the ocean&apos;s beauty -- and danger -- and dared to captain ships of their own.\r\n\r\nPaperback: 304 pages\r\nPublisher: Simon &amp; Schuster; 1st Touchstone edition (March 6, 2001)","last_updated":"2017-12-09T12:09:06.137Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b3b59e9a6d618b68f1c9a52c5c7c766f8ddcfe2","dn":"She Captains: Heroines and Hellions of the Sea","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"3b3b59e9a6d618b68f1c9a52c5c7c766f8ddcfe2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,59,89,233,166,214,24,182,143,28,154,82,197,199,199,102,248,221,207,226]},"name":"She Captains: Heroines and Hellions of the Sea","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
