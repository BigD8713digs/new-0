Walker [epub]\r\n\r\nKing Harold Godwinson (c. 1022-66) is one of history&apos;s shadowy figures, known mainly for his defeat and death at the Battle of Hastings. His true status and achievements have been overshadowed by the events of October 1066 and by the bias imposed by the Norman victory. In truth, he deserves to be recalled as one of England&apos;s greatest rulers.\r\n\r\nHarold: The Last Anglo-Saxon King sets out to correct this distorted image by presenting Harold&apos;s life in its proper context, offering the first full-length critical study of his career in the years leading up to 1066. This book should be read by everyone wanting to understand the events surrounding the Norman conquest.\r\n\r\nPaperback: 352 pages\r\nPublisher: The History Press; New edition (1 April 2010)","last_updated":"2017-12-30T12:00:20.390Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:67e6e7512aef6e4f6165ec857b5d424d5f4bf3f4","dn":"Harold: The Last Anglo-Saxon King","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"67e6e7512aef6e4f6165ec857b5d424d5f4bf3f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,230,231,81,42,239,110,79,97,101,236,133,123,93,66,77,95,75,243,244]},"name":"Harold: The Last Anglo-Saxon King","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
