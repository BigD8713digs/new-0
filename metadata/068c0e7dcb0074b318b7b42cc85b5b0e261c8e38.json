Yes We (Still) Can looks at how Obama navigated the forces that allowed Trump to win the White House to become one of the most consequential presidents in American history, why Trump surprised everyone, and how Democrats can come out on top in the long run.\r\n\r\nPart political memoir, part blueprint for progressives in the Trump era, Yes We (Still) Can is an insider&apos;s take on the crazy politics of our time. Pfeiffer, one of Barack Obama&apos;s longest serving advisors, tells never-before-told stories from Obama&apos;s presidential campaigns to his time in the White House, providing readers with an in-depth, behind the-scenes look at life on the front lines of politics.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-07-01T12:14:50.462Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:068c0e7dcb0074b318b7b42cc85b5b0e261c8e38","dn":"Yes We (Still) Can by Dan Pfeiffer EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"068c0e7dcb0074b318b7b42cc85b5b0e261c8e38","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,140,14,125,203,0,116,179,24,183,180,44,200,91,91,14,38,28,142,56]},"name":"Yes We (Still) Can by Dan Pfeiffer EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
