At the heart of it all, beneath the washes of guitar, the woozy reveries, are sturdy, intensely melodic songs. You hear that from the very start of the album, when Pull slides into view, slide guitar casting shapes and shadows across the arpeggios beneath, while lightly jazzy drums propel the song forward and Gunrup mournfully whispers his barely audible lyrics, before the song ascends into a refrain that sounds like every emotion combined. That combination of melody and mood comes from the way the songs are made, and the interaction between Gunrup and his fellow members, Reine Fiske (also of Dungen, guitar), Moussa Fadera (drums), Alexis Benson (bass), and Frederik Swahn (keyboards and guitars). Gunrup writes alone, in what he calls &#x201C;a very disgusting process. It&#x2019;s just me in my underwear on my couch.&#x201D; He emerges with a complete song &#x2013; &#x201C;the intros, the outros, the melodies, all the chords&#x201D; &#x2013; which he takes to the band, imagining they will play it just as he imagined. Except they never do. &#x201C;They can feel rather than hear what needs to be done,&#x201D; Gunrup says. &#x201C;They do pretty much what they please.&#x201D; \r\nYet In Transit does not sound self-indulgent. Gunrup&#x2019;s songs are the very heart of In Transit, and the musicians&#x2019; playing always serves them, rather than overwhelming them. On For No One, you can hear the subtlety of their interaction, which is not what one might expect to say of a song in which whistling feedback provides the core of its climax &#x2013; it&#x2019;s only at the end you realise how cleverly it has transformed from what begins as fingerpicked near-folk into something very different. \r\n&#x201D; \r\n \r\n\r\nTracklist: \r\n1.
