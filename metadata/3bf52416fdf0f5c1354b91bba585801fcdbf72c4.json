He takes us to Elba, where Napoleon was once imprisoned; to Salina, famous for its capers, just as Pantelleria is famous for its dessert wine; to Pianosa, where dangerous Mafia bosses were kept and which Joseph Heller used as the setting for Catch-22; to Capri, where Maxim Gorky ran a school for revolutionaries which was visited by Lenin and Stalin&#x2026;\r\n\r\n&#x2026;to all of Italy&#x2019;s 52 islands which he has never written about before.\r\n\r\nWith 30 years of experience as a food critic, travel writer and adventurer, Fort is an excellent guide through the culinary and cultural history he encounters during his summer in the islands.\r\n\r\nGenre: Non-Fiction &gt; Cooking, Culinary Journey","last_updated":"2018-09-17T12:16:59.219Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:3bf52416fdf0f5c1354b91bba585801fcdbf72c4","dn":"Summer in the Islands by Matthew Fort (.epub) ","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"3bf52416fdf0f5c1354b91bba585801fcdbf72c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,245,36,22,253,240,245,193,53,75,145,187,165,133,128,31,205,191,114,196]},"name":"Summer in the Islands by Matthew Fort (.epub) ","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
