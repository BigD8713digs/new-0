El Alamein, Kasserine Pass, Poland, Belgium, Normandy on D-Day, the disastrous Russian front--von Luck fought there with some of the best soldiers in the world. German soldiers.\r\n\r\nAwarded the German Cross in Gold and the Knight&apos;s Cross, von Luck writes as an officer and a gentleman. Told with the vivid detail of an impassioned eyewitness, his rare and moving memoir has become a classic in the literature of World War II, a first-person chronicle of the glory--and the inevitable tragedy--of a superb soldier fighting Hitler&apos;s war","last_updated":"2018-03-19T12:07:07.339Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f50ce44373397d320efb8e32e1a9a297891cda6","dn":"Panzer Commander.Hans von Luck","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"7f50ce44373397d320efb8e32e1a9a297891cda6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,80,206,68,55,51,151,211,32,239,184,227,46,26,154,41,120,145,205,166]},"name":"Panzer Commander.Hans von Luck","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
