She is a farmer&apos;s faithful wife, but she has left her husband to don the uniform of a Union soldier in the Civil War.

Through bloodshed and hysteria and heartbreak, she becomes a hero, a folk legend, a madwoman and a traitor to the American cause.\r\n\r\nLaird Hunt&apos;s dazzling new novel throws a light on the adventurous women who chose to fight instead of stay behind.
