Data objects (nodes) and connections between them are represented as shapes and lines which can be created, linked, moved, removed and tagged to create and understand connected data.Start from scratch adding your own idea bubbles and give them names with a virtual keyboard, or import lists and tables from text files or .csv files. Import image files for visual tagging. Connect things together and change your perspective by moving around. Save and restore your maps to update or revisit your work.This allows something like mind-mapping or brainstorming on a whiteboard to draw big ideas and complex topics. You may find this useful for: Conceiving a project Planning an event Plotting a screenplay Mapping a networkThe tools are generic so it&apos;s up to you what to use them for. Best wishes and let us know what you think!","last_updated":"2017-07-22T12:00:37.411Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:63e0df1807835c1ee82355970656d97dd2498c04","dn":"Noda Update 22.07.2017","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"63e0df1807835c1ee82355970656d97dd2498c04","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,224,223,24,7,131,92,30,232,35,85,151,6,86,217,125,210,73,140,4]},"name":"Noda Update 22.07.2017","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
