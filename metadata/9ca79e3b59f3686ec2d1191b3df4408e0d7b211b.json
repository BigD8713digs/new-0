This book is intended for those who have little or no practical experience of translation in a commercial environment. It offers comprehensive advice on all aspects that are relevant to the would-be translator and, whilst intended mainly for those who wish to go freelance, it is also of relevance to the staff translator as a guide to organization of work and time, as well as to career progression. Advice is given on how to set up as a translator, from the purchase of equipment to the acquisition of clients. The process of translation is discussed from initial inquiry to delivery of the finished product. Hints are given on how to assess requirements, how to charge for work, how to research and use source material, and how to present the finished product.\r\n\r\nEnglish | PDF |Educational | ISBN/ASIN: 1853597295|1 MB","last_updated":"2018-01-22T21:40:03.637Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ca79e3b59f3686ec2d1191b3df4408e0d7b211b","dn":"A Practical Guide for Translators","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"9ca79e3b59f3686ec2d1191b3df4408e0d7b211b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,167,158,59,89,243,104,110,194,209,25,27,61,244,64,142,13,123,33,27]},"name":"A Practical Guide for Translators","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
