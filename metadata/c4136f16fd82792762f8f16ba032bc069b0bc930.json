This compilation also interprets the term &#x201C;Physiology&#x94; in its widest sense to include all aspects of the functioning of the organism from the behavior of animals to the mode of function of enzymes. For this reason, structural adaptations have been reviewed in detail only where their functional role is understood and where they constitute a specific adaptation to defined environmental conditions. \r\nThis publication benefits students and individuals conducting research on the physiology of marine animals","last_updated":"2017-06-15T12:03:43.240Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4136f16fd82792762f8f16ba032bc069b0bc930","dn":"Adaptation to Environment - Essays on the Physiology of Marine A","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"c4136f16fd82792762f8f16ba032bc069b0bc930","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,19,111,22,253,130,121,39,98,248,241,107,160,50,188,6,155,11,201,48]},"name":"Adaptation to Environment - Essays on the Physiology of Marine A","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
