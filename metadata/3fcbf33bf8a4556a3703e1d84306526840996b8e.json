A strange glow appears in the sky. Sam, a forty-something door-to-door salesman, travels through the few inhabited zones of the Californian desert in search of clients, yet everything seems deserted. What&apos;s more, his wife won&apos;t answer his calls. It&apos;s as if everyone were avoiding him. When his car breaks down, Sam becomes a prisoner of the empty, hostile environment. Alone and without human contact for days on end, he listens continuously to a talk-show on the only local radio station. The host, a man named Eddy, takes calls from listeners who share their thoughts on a child killer at large in the area. At the same time, Sam starts getting psychologically harassed by strange threats he receives on his pager. Gradually, people begin to reappear and attempt to kill him. Sam has become a target and he must now defend himself. Little by little he loses it, caught up in a paranoid identity crisis. Is he truly the killer they&apos;re after, or is he being driven to become so?                \r\n\r\nYear: 2016                \r\nDirector: Christophe Deroo                \r\nWriters: Christophe Deroo, Clement Tuffreau                \r\nStars: Rusty Joiner, Sigrid La Chapelle, Rhoda Pell, Hassan Galedary                \r\nGenres: Horror, Mystery, Thriller                \r\nLanguage: English                \r\n\r\nRELEASE.....................: Sam.Was.Here.2016.720p.BluRay.x264.VPPV\r\nVIDEO.......................: 1000  \r\nCODEC.......................: x264\r\nRUNTIME.....................: 75 min\t         \r\nRESOLUTION..................: 1280x536                \r\nFRAME RATE..................: 25.000 fps\r\nAUDIO.......................: 2 Channel / AAC / 192kbps                \r\nFILE SIZE / FORMAT..........: 620 MiB / MKV\r\nSOURCE......................: BluRay                \r\n\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nPoster:  <a href=\"\nhttps://snap.vppv.la/sam-was-here/2016/sam-was-here-2016-poster.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_NEW\">\nhttps://snap.vppv.la/sam-was-here/2016/sam-was-here-2016-poster.jpg</a> \r\n\r\nWarning!!!
