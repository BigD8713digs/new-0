I&apos;m a big surround music fan and made this album so I can listen it in surround through headphones on a portable player. The sources of this release are surround versions of the tracks ripped from the SACD release. I&apos;ve converted them to virtual surround with Creative&apos;s BlasterX Acoustic Engine Pro. Using state-of-the-art technology, it gives an enhanced virtual 7.1 channel surround sound experience with regular stereo headphones.\r\n\r\nGenre: Rock, Pop\r\nStyle: Brit Pop, Pop Rock, Soft Rock\r\nLabel: Interscope Records\r\nRelease Date: May 10, 2004\r\nSource: SACD 2.8 MHz 5.1 DSD\r\nResampler: Adobe Audition\r\nSample rate: 44100 Hz\r\nBits per sample: 16\r\nCodec: FLAC\r\n\r\nHopes and Fears is the debut studio album by the English alternative rock band Keane. It was released on 10 May 2004 in the United Kingdom and topped the UK Albums Chart upon release. It was the second best-selling British album of 2004, behind the Scissor Sisters&apos; self-titled debut album, and has since been certified 9&#xD7; Platinum by the BPI. The album returned to the top of the charts after winning a Brit Award for Best Album in February 2005. \r\n\r\nWith more than 2.7 million copies sold in the UK alone, Hopes and Fears ranks the 11th-best-selling album of the 2000s in the UK. In July 2011, it was ranked the 9th biggest-selling album of the 21st century in the UK. Worldwide, the album has sold over 5.8 million copies as of November 2009.\r\n\r\nThe album takes its name from the song &quot;Snowed Under&quot;, released as a B-side on the single for &quot;Somewhere Only We Know&quot;. Unlike their follow up album, most songs were already composed by the album&apos;s conception date; the track &quot;She Has No Time&quot; was composed circa 1999, making it the earliest composed song appearing on the album, and the remaining were composed just after former member Dominic Scott&apos;s departure in July 2001. The tracks &quot;On a Day Like Today&quot; and &quot;We Might As Well Be Strangers&quot; became the last to be composed, circa 2003. The album was recorded at Helioscentric Studios in Peasmarsh, Rye by Andy Green and the band between September and Christmas 2003. James Sanger did not attend any recording sessions post his involvement with the band in 2001.\r\n\r\n\r\nTracklist:\r\n\r\n01. Somewhere Only We Know (3:58)\r\n02.
