This famous photograph captures the full anguish of desegregation - in Little Rock and throughout the South - and an epic moment in the civil rights movement. \r\n\r\nIn this gripping book, David Margolick tells the remarkable story of two separate lives unexpectedly braided together. He explores how the haunting picture of Elizabeth and Hazel came to be taken, its significance in the wider world, and why, for the next half-century, neither woman has ever escaped from its long shadow. He recounts Elizabeth&apos;s struggle to overcome the trauma of her hate-filled school experience, and Hazel&apos;s long efforts to atone for a fateful, horrible mistake. \r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-04-23T12:02:30.684Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:4315e4367b25edfcccf698d4991503d2cf3becd0","dn":"Elizabeth and Hazel by David Margolick EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"4315e4367b25edfcccf698d4991503d2cf3becd0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,21,228,54,123,37,237,252,204,246,152,212,153,21,3,210,207,59,236,208]},"name":"Elizabeth and Hazel by David Margolick EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
