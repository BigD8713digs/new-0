The powerful weapon broke the destroyer&apos;s back, flooded her engine room, killed dozens of sailors, and sparked raging fires. While accompanying ships were able to rescue most of Strong&apos;s surviving crewmen, scores were submerged in the ocean as the shattered warship sank beneath the waves - and a young officer&apos;s harrowing story of survival began.\r\n\r\nBased on official American and Japanese histories, personal memoirs, and the author&apos;s exclusive interviews with key participants, The Castaway&apos;s War tells the entirely unique and very personal tale of Navy Lieutenant Hugh Barr Miller&apos;s fight for survival against both a hostile environment and an implacable human enemy.\r\n\r\nxx","last_updated":"2018-01-25T12:11:49.210Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:d71fa958287a4c00ce3375678d66158726979848","dn":"The Castaway's War by Stephen Harding EPUB","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"d71fa958287a4c00ce3375678d66158726979848","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,31,169,88,40,122,76,0,206,51,117,103,141,102,21,135,38,151,152,72]},"name":"The Castaway's War by Stephen Harding EPUB","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
