Starting with a general overview of functional concepts you&#x2019;ll explore common functional features such as first-class and higher-order functions, pure functions and more, and how these are accomplished in Python to give you the core foundations you&#x2019;ll build upon. After that, you&#x2019;ll discover common functional optimizations for Python to help your apps reach even higher speeds. You&apos;ll also explore data preparation techniques and data exploration in depth, along with learning how the Python standard library fits the functional programming model. Finally, to top off your journey into the world of function Python you&#x2019;ll at look at the PyMonad project and some larger examples to put everything into perspective","last_updated":"2018-08-20T12:09:31.993Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:8777e27d0031d80c81ead3545a655383b7f35313","dn":"Functional Python Programming Discover the power of functional ","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"8777e27d0031d80c81ead3545a655383b7f35313","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,119,226,125,0,49,216,12,129,234,211,84,90,101,83,131,183,243,83,19]},"name":"Functional Python Programming Discover the power of functional ","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
