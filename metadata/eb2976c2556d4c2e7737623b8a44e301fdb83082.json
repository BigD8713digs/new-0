During a tumultuous period following 2016&apos;s The Life of Pablo, he garnered as much attention for headline controversy as for his music: he was hospitalized for stress and exhaustion following the cancellation of his Saint Pablo tour, later revealing a struggle with opioid addiction, and a disastrous pre-album promotion cycle was packed with provocative political proclamations. West&apos;s world seemed to be spiraling out of control. As the lines between public life and studio recordings blurred, the two became increasingly inextricable, culminating with his complicated eighth effort, Ye. While Pablo delved into the darker corners of fame and family, Ye is messier and more uncomfortable, especially when heard in the context of his high-profile outbursts preceding its release. West places mental health at the center, complicating his usual bravado","last_updated":"2018-10-27T12:49:46.034Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb2976c2556d4c2e7737623b8a44e301fdb83082","dn":"Kanye West - ye (2018) [24.44 FLAC]","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"eb2976c2556d4c2e7737623b8a44e301fdb83082","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,41,118,194,85,109,76,46,119,55,98,59,138,68,227,1,253,184,48,130]},"name":"Kanye West - ye (2018) [24.44 FLAC]","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
