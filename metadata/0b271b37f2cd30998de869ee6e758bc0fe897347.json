Against all the odds, in the face of an unstable record industry that never embraced their restless experimentation, Chicago avant-rock pioneers CHEER-ACCIDENT have survived to release their 18th album, Putting Off Death. More than 30 years after first joining forces, fellow eclecticists Thymme Jones and Jeff Libersher have faced down the inevitable and returned with a new set of songs that&#x2019;s as unpredictable, exploratory and viscerally compelling as anything they&#x2019;ve released over the course of their erratically evolving career. The music is action packed and filled to the brim with living, breathing humanity. The band&#x2019;s continuing hunger bleeds through in the music&#x2019;s immediacy. As Jones says, &quot;There&apos;s still something to prove.&quot;\r\nThe band&#x2019;s third release for Cuneiform follows in the elusive, meandering trajectory of their earlier work, which is always instantly identifiable if never quite definable. They&#x2019;ve managed to conjure a unique collage of intricate prog, lush pop and experimental noise, drawing on hugely disparate influences without ever settling on a sound that could be definitively traced to any of them in isolation. Meaning that they always did and continue to, sound like no one but themselves. - Cuneiform","last_updated":"2017-06-03T12:00:56.516Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b271b37f2cd30998de869ee6e758bc0fe897347","dn":"Cheer-Accident 2017 Putting Off Death","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"0b271b37f2cd30998de869ee6e758bc0fe897347","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,39,27,55,242,205,48,153,141,232,105,238,110,117,139,192,254,137,115,71]},"name":"Cheer-Accident 2017 Putting Off Death","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
