The Civil War is a tense and gripping depiction of his struggle with Pompey over the leadership of Republican Rome - a conflict that spanned the entire Roman world, from Gaul and Spain to Asia and Africa.\r\n\r\nWhere Caesar&apos;s own account leaves off in 48 BC, his lieutenants take up the history, describing the vital battles of Munda, Spain and Thapsus, and the installation of Cleopatra, later Caesar&apos;s mistress, as Queen of Egypt. Together these narratives paint a full picture of the events that brought Caesar supreme power - and paved the way for his assassination only months later.\r\n\r\nGaius Julius Caesar was born in 100 BC into an ancient patrician family. He was imprisoned for a time with his family, for protesting against the then leadership of Sulla, but advanced slowly through the sixties rising to the rank of praetor and forming the &apos;first triumvirate&apos; with Pompey and Crassus. Elected consul in 59 BC, he then became Governor for Transalpine Gaul. After the death of Crassus and the defeat of Pompey in 45 BC, Caesar returned to Rome as dictator. He was assassinated in March 44 BC.\r\n\r\nPaperback: 368 pages\r\nPublisher: Penguin Classics; Reprint edition (November 18, 1976)","last_updated":"2017-12-09T12:09:12.557Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:aecb1bcf36d43bd424603cf2cd4f17adaad192e0","dn":"The Civil War (Penguin Classics) by Julius Caesar","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"aecb1bcf36d43bd424603cf2cd4f17adaad192e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,203,27,207,54,212,59,212,36,96,60,242,205,79,23,173,170,209,146,224]},"name":"The Civil War (Penguin Classics) by Julius Caesar","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
