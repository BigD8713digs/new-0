In How the Internet Happened, he chronicles the whole fascinating story for the first time, beginning in a dusty Illinois basement in 1993, when a group of college kids set off a once-in-an-epoch revolution with what would become the first &#x201C;dotcom.&#x201D; \r\n\r\nDepicting the lives of now-famous innovators like Netscape&#x2019;s Marc Andreessen andMark Zuckerberg, McCullough also reveals surprising quirks and unknown tales as he tracks both the technology and the culture around the internet&#x2019;s rise. Cinematic in detail and unprecedented in scope, the result both enlightens and informs as it draws back the curtain on the new rhythm of disruption and innovation the internet fostered, and helps to redefine an era that changed every part of our lives.\r\n\r\nGenre: Non-Fiction &gt; Tech &amp; Devices","last_updated":"2018-10-23T12:28:45.130Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:33903b0e78b54e0ad8722c3ce53596cd1ec2a917","dn":"How the Internet Happened by Brian Mccullough (.epub)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"33903b0e78b54e0ad8722c3ce53596cd1ec2a917","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,144,59,14,120,181,78,10,216,114,44,60,229,53,150,205,30,194,169,23]},"name":"How the Internet Happened by Brian Mccullough (.epub)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
