Metric have never been shy about shifting their sound, and each time they do their core strengths never fade. Emily Haines&apos; powerful voice and evocative lyrics, their rock-solid rhythm section, and their ability to craft immediately hooky modern rock; these things are out in full force on Art of Doubt. This time, the guitar playing of James Shaw makes the leap to a starring role. He&apos;s been great at playing a supporting role on their last few albums, but here his slashing guitar lines, rippling fills, and atmospheric pedal work give the songs a sometime gritty, sometime spacy edge that harks back to the 2005 album Live It Out. To match his energy and fiery playing, the whole band sounds energized in a way it certainly wasn&apos;t on Pagans in Vegas","last_updated":"2018-10-07T12:57:11.198Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:d944e18f4a8f13bf854c2c64e7d5b23b98942fe4","dn":"Metric - Art of Doubt (2018) [16.44 FLAC]","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"d944e18f4a8f13bf854c2c64e7d5b23b98942fe4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,68,225,143,74,143,19,191,133,76,44,100,231,213,178,59,152,148,47,228]},"name":"Metric - Art of Doubt (2018) [16.44 FLAC]","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
