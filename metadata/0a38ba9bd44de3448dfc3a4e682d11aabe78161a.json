Even two-time Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning cartoonist Mike Luckovich admits it&#x2019;s been a challenge covering the Cheeto-in-Chief in his internationally syndicated political cartoons. But Mike rose to the challenge, pulling no punches and stripping down Trump and his cronies with his signature wit and style.\r\n\r\nCovering Trump&#x2019;s antics from the 2016 election through to the Mueller investigation, the cartoons in A Very Stable Genius tackle key moments in Trump&#x2019;s political career, offering scathing insights on everything from his disastrous track record with women to his revolving-door cabinet to his suspiciously intimate relationship with a certain Russian leader. Woven through with searing commentary and personal anecdotes, Mike&#x2019;s cartoons will shock and delight you, making you think as much as they make you laugh &#x2015; when you&#x2019;re not too busy being terrified.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenre: Non-Fiction &gt; General","last_updated":"2018-09-20T12:13:06.412Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a38ba9bd44de3448dfc3a4e682d11aabe78161a","dn":"A Very Stable Genius by Mike Luckovich (.epub)","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"0a38ba9bd44de3448dfc3a4e682d11aabe78161a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,56,186,155,212,77,227,68,141,252,58,78,104,45,17,170,190,120,22,26]},"name":"A Very Stable Genius by Mike Luckovich (.epub)","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
