Breaching a network is not considered an ingenious effort anymore, so it is very important to gain expertise in securing your network.\r\n\r\nThe book begins by showing you how to identify malicious network behaviour and improve your wireless security. We will teach you what network sniffing is, the various tools associated with it, and how to scan for vulnerable wireless networks. Then we&#x2019;ll show you how attackers hide the payloads and bypass the victim&#x2019;s antivirus.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, we&#x2019;ll teach you how to spoof IP / MAC address and perform an SQL injection attack and prevent it on your website. We will create an evil twin and demonstrate how to intercept network traffic. Later, you will get familiar with Shodan and Intrusion Detection and will explore the features and tools associated with it. Toward the end, we cover tools such as Yardstick, Ubertooth, Wifi Pineapple, and Alfa used for wireless penetration testing and auditing.\r\n\r\nThis book will show the tools and platform to ethically hack your own network whether it is for your business or for your personal home Wi-Fi","last_updated":"2017-08-04T12:01:56.517Z","parsed":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a1ae7ea961baf69d958c3d237c615925ac8bece","dn":"Applied Network Security(2017) - True PDF - zeke23","tr":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"infoHash":"3a1ae7ea961baf69d958c3d237c615925ac8bece","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,26,231,234,150,27,175,105,217,88,195,210,55,198,21,146,90,200,190,206]},"name":"Applied Network Security(2017) - True PDF - zeke23","announce":["udp://exodus.desync.com:6969","udp://open.demonii.com:1337","udp://tracker.coppersurfer.tk:6969","udp://tracker.leechers-paradise.org:6969","udp://zer0day.ch:1337"],"urlList":[]}}
