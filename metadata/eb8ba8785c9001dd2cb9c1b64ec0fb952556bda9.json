Slime Rancher  is the tale of Beatrix LeBeau, a plucky, young rancher who sets out for a life a thousand light years away from Earth on the &#x2018;Far, Far Range&#x2019; where she tries her hand at making a living wrangling slimes. With a can-do attitude, plenty of grit, and her trusty vacpack, Beatrix attempts to stake a claim, amass a fortune, and avoid the continual peril that looms from the rolling, jiggling avalanche of slimes around every corner.Sounds great! Give me more details! Slime Rancher is a first-person, sandbox experience where players will solve problems and survive through mastery of their vacpack: a vacuum/cannon/backpack that can vacuum up and blast out anything that isn&#x2019;t nailed to the ground.Each day will present new challenges to players as they attempt to amass a great fortune in the business of slime ranching. While players are free to approach these challenges however they wish, a typical day might look like this:    You wake at the crack of dawn and get to watering the crops at the ranch. Some slimes are vegetarian, after all. Then it&#x2019;s time to gather up the plumpest hens from the chicken coop. Some slimes are totally not vegetarian, after all.
